<div> robustness, imperceptibility, computational efficiency, adversarial attacks, machine learning

Summary: 
Localized adversarial attacks in machine learning, specifically focusing on perturbations in specific regions of input data, were evaluated in this study. Methods such as FGSM, PGD, and C&W were tested for their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. Results showed that localized attacks had lower mean pixel perturbations, higher PSNR, and improved SSIM compared to global attacks. However, these benefits came with increased computational effort and a slight reduction in Attack Success Rate. Iterative methods like PGD and C&W showed more robustness to localization constraints compared to single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics. This comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks provides valuable insights for enhancing attack strategies and designing robust defense systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&amp;W, to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative methods, such as PGD and C&amp;W, are more robust to localization constraints than single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and designing robust defensive systems.

<div> Keywords: large language models, in-context learning, multitask learning, retention, continual learning

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates. This study explores the retention characteristics of ICL in multitask settings and introduces in-context continual learning (ICCL) which incorporates continual learning ability through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks show that ICCL benefits from distributed practice (DP) with a spacing "sweet spot" for retention, resembling human memory patterns. A human-retention similarity metric is proposed to evaluate how closely CL methods align with human retention dynamics. Linear-attention models like MAMBA and RWKV exhibit human-like retention patterns, despite Transformer-based LLMs outperforming in retention performance. ICCL emerges as a cognitively plausible and effective continual learning paradigm, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma in traditional CL methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning (ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner, whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored. Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning (ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that, for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice (DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Summary:
Collaborative learning across different model architectures is challenging due to interoperability and privacy concerns. The proposed framework addresses these challenges by supporting model heterogeneity and enabling modular composition during inference. Clients in this framework adopt a common fusion-layer output dimension, allowing each model to be partitioned into personalized and generalized modular blocks. By sharing fusion-layer outputs while keeping model parameters and architectures private, the framework ensures interoperability and privacy preservation. Experimental results demonstrate superior communication efficiency compared to existing federated learning and federated split learning approaches, with stable training performance across heterogeneous architectures.

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning (FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across heterogeneous architectures.

<div> self-attention, relations, capacity, scaling law, multi-head attention <br>
<br>
Summary: 
The article introduces Relational Graph Recognition (RGR) to understand the capacity of self-attention in learning relations among tokens. It formulates a capacity scaling law, showing that a key dimension $D_K$ is necessary and sufficient to recover relations in a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges. The study reveals a rationale for multi-head attention to mitigate interference and increase recoverable relations. Experimental results confirm the capacity scaling law and the benefit of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads for better performance in self-attention mechanisms. The findings offer a concrete scaling law for self-attention capacity and provide a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across heads. <div>
arXiv:2509.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges, and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target. When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m > d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across heads.

Summary:
An innovative black-box attack method for tabular data is introduced in this work, focusing on adversarial robustness in structured data. The approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, efficiently navigating discrete and continuous feature spaces with minimal oracle access. Through extensive experiments, it is shown that the attack successfully compromises a large portion of the test set across various models, including classical machine learning classifiers and large language model pipelines. The attack achieves high success rates above 90% consistently while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results emphasize the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, highlighting the pressing need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models, ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model (LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

<div> keywords: Margin-based optimization, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), preferences, adaptive margins, discriminative performance<br>
Summary: <br>
Margin-based optimization is essential for improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks, particularly in the context of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Existing methods often overlook the varying strengths of preferences, leading to suboptimal performance. This study introduces an approach that leverages preferences over preferences to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. By incorporating this ordinal signal into Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the proposed DPO-PoP method demonstrates enhanced discriminative and generative performance compared to existing approaches. Empirical results on the UltraFeedback dataset showcase the superiority of the proposed method over vanilla DPO and versions with fixed or ground-truth margins. Moreover, the study highlights the tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance, emphasizing the need for balancing the correct labeling of weaker preferences with maintaining generative quality. To address this tradeoff, the authors propose two sampling strategies for gathering preference-over-preference labels, each emphasizing either discriminative or generative performance. <br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption, the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies: CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical results on real-world data.

Summary:
Neighborhood sampling is essential for training large-scale graph neural networks, helping manage memory and time costs. By using neural tangent kernels, which characterize training dynamics, researchers analyzed different neighborhood sampling approaches and their corresponding Gaussian process posteriors. With limited samples, the posteriors differ but converge with increasing sample size. The posterior covariance, indicative of mean squared prediction error, is incomparable, demonstrating that no single sampling approach dominates. <div>
arXiv:2509.22868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the (analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance, which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

Summary:
This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods in the context of hydropower plants to improve predictive maintenance. The study addresses challenges in acoustic preprocessing under noisy conditions and extracts time- and frequency-domain features. Three machine learning models, including LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, are benchmarked on real-world datasets from a pumped-storage plant in Austria. The One-Class SVM demonstrated the best accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder showed strong detection performance (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at a higher computational cost. This research contributes to enhancing the reliability and efficiency of industrial factories and energy producers by enabling early detection and prevention of unplanned outages through advanced acoustic anomaly detection techniques.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then, we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC 0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational cost.

Summary:  
This study introduces an extension of Conformal Fairness (CF) to Federated Learning, aiming to address fairness concerns in machine learning models. The standard Conformal Prediction technique offers uncertainty quantification but lacks consideration of sensitive attributes. By incorporating fairness principles into CP, the new framework, CF, ensures conditional coverage guarantees across diverse subgroups. The research explores auditing federated models for fairness by examining fairness-related gaps among demographic groups. Empirical validation through experiments on various datasets in different domains demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, benefiting from the exchangeability assumption within the Federated Learning setting. This extension of CF to Federated Learning contributes to promoting fairness and accountability in machine learning applications.

arXiv:2509.22907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work, we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel approach to distilling large language models (LLMs) by treating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. The method focuses on maximizing task-specific rewards while ensuring that the model does not diverge significantly from the teacher model. By adapting constrained state augmented reinforcement learning, the approach maintains constraint satisfaction without the need for state augmentation or teacher model access during deployment. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that the proposed method outperforms soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines in terms of constraint satisfaction rates and reasoning capabilities while maintaining competitive task performance.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware distillation in resource-constrained settings.

Summary: 
MonoCon introduces a novel approach to learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations in artificial intelligence. It utilizes functional constraints, specifically employing a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. By leveraging co-adaptation between the encoder and head through contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon produces robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings with minimal performance trade-off. In experiments on the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon achieves representations that are significantly more compact and robust compared to baseline methods, while maintaining high classification accuracy. Results on an SNLI sentence similarity task further demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across different domains. The ultra-compact representations learned by MonoCon offer a unified solution to challenges in various contexts, from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on $\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

<br>
Summary:<br>
Quantization-aware training (QAT) is crucial for improving quantized neural network accuracy. The optimal allocation of compute between full-precision (FP) and QAT phases is explored. Experimental data shows that the loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with total compute. The tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic accurately predicts the optimal QAT fraction. A loss scaling law is derived to predict optimal QAT ratios and final performance across different strategies and quantization widths. Predictions include the optimal QAT bit width under memory constraints and comparison of QAT accuracy to FP model accuracy. A cooldown and QAT fusion approach integrates learning rate decay with QAT, saving compute by eliminating redundant FP updates. These insights provide practical guidance for efficient QAT planning and training higher-quality quantized models within the same compute budget. <br> <div>

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from 86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide range of model sizes and quantization widths using the tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality quantized models with the same compute budget.

<div> SOAP, Adam, Shampoo, gradient whitening, neural networks <br>
Summary: <br>
The SOAP optimization algorithm, a variant of Adam and Shampoo, has shown promise in neural network training. The algorithms are analyzed in terms of gradient whitening, with their preconditioners approximating the whitening matrix. A theoretical equivalence between SOAP and Shampoo is established under certain assumptions. Empirical evaluations in language modeling and grayscale image colorization show SOAP's convergence rate is similar to Shampoo, with no significant advantage over Adam and Shampoo in final loss. These findings align with the theoretical equivalence between SOAP and Shampoo. <div>

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training, achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns with their equivalence in theory.

<div> quantization, language models, post-training, outliers, scales
<br>
Post-training quantization for deploying large language models at low precision faces challenges at bit-widths of 4 and below due to precision issues caused by representing outliers. The newly introduced SINQ method enhances existing quantizers by adding a second-axis scale factor and a fast algorithm to normalize variances per row and column, reducing matrix imbalance. This method is applicable to any linear layers without interactions between layers. Evaluations on Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V2.5 models show significant perplexity improvements on WikiText2 and C4 datasets compared to uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines. SINQ can be combined with calibration and non-uniform quantization for further enhancements. A code repository is available for easy implementation and reproduction of the results. 
<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

Summary: 
Data assimilation (DA) plays a crucial role in enhancing solutions for partial differential equations (PDEs, such as those in numerical weather prediction, by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. In this study, a meta-learning framework that utilizes the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator is proposed for a family of DA problems, providing an effective initialization for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear advection equation show that the FNO-CG approach significantly reduces the average relative error by 62% and the number of iterations by 17% compared to standard CG. These improvements are particularly notable in ill-conditioned scenarios, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG for challenging DA problems. <div>

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction, by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$ compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG for challenging DA problems.

Summary: <br>
This paper introduces a suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal learners for estimating conditional distributions of potential outcomes in observational data. These learners, called GDR-learners, are flexible and can utilize various deep generative models such as conditional normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models. Unlike existing methods, the GDR-learners exhibit properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness, making them asymptotically optimal. Through synthetic experiments, it is demonstrated that GDR-learners are highly effective and outperform current approaches in accurately estimating the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. <div>

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust) learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b) conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models (GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential outcomes.

<div> robust estimation, Generative AI, external validity, evaluation sampling bias, persona ratings

Summary:<br>
This study introduces a doubly-robust estimation framework to address evaluation sampling bias in Generative AI (GenAI) systems. External validity concerns regarding the generalization of evaluations from lab-based settings to real-world deployment conditions are addressed by combining persona ratings, produced by prompting an LLM evaluator to mimic human raters with specific characteristics, with human ratings obtained under sampling bias. The framework ensures statistically valid system quality estimates by utilizing models trained to predict human ratings from persona ratings and source data affected by sampling bias, or by employing a reweighting model to correct for bias. The effectiveness of the approach is validated theoretically and through a Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) that manipulates persona quality and evaluation bias levels. This work establishes a principled method for integrating imperfect persona ratings with human ratings to derive reliable system quality assessments. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Summary: <br>
This paper presents a novel framework for training discrete diffusion models as effective policies in complex settings with large combinatorial action spaces. The key innovation lies in an efficient online training process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By using policy mirror descent (PMD) to define a regularized target policy distribution, the policy update is framed as a distribution matching problem, enabling the diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This decoupled approach enhances training performance and stabilizes learning. The method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample efficiency across various challenging combinatorial benchmarks such as DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent systems. Experimental results demonstrate that diffusion policies outperform other baseline methods in terms of performance. <br> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem, training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks, including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior performance compared to other baselines.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel off-policy actor-critic (AC) framework that tackles the challenges of instability and actor learning efficiency in off-policy RL. The framework addresses the "deadly triad" instability and the "moving target" problem by introducing functional critic modeling. The theoretical analysis in a linear function setting proves the convergence of the proposed framework, making it the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. Additionally, a neural network architecture is proposed for functional critic modeling, showcasing its effectiveness through experiments on RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark. By combining theoretical analysis with practical experimentation, the study presents a robust solution for off-policy actor-critic learning under challenging settings. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad" instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target" problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Summary:
In the paper "Mathematical Programming Formulation Improvement with Optimization Expertise," the authors address the challenge of automating the task of translating natural language into executable optimization models. Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), current approaches struggle with accuracy due to limited and noisy training data. To enhance formulation accuracy in mixed-integer linear programming, the authors introduce a systematic approach that integrates optimization expertise. By cleaning training data and utilizing domain-informed prompting and feedback, they improve accuracy by 14 percentage points on average. This method enables LLMs to benefit from class-specific error analysis and solver feedback, leading to iterative refinement in optimization formulation. This work represents a significant step towards developing robust LLM-assisted optimization models.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however, achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average, enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

The article introduces a novel framework called T-Tamer for efficient serving of machine learning models, especially in multi-model scenarios like cascaded models. The framework formalizes the decision process of when to exit and which model to consult, with a focus on achieving optimal performance trade-offs. The main finding is that recall, the ability to revisit earlier models, is crucial for achieving provable performance guarantees. Strategies without recall cannot approximate the optimal trade-off, while recall-based strategies can do so in polynomial time. Experimental validation on synthetic datasets and vision/NLP benchmarks demonstrates that recall-based strategies consistently deliver efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs. Overall, this work establishes a principled foundation for designing early-exit and cascaded models that bridges heuristic practices with theoretical guarantees.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency, resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and cascaded models.

<div> Keywords: Sparse Autoencoders, variational methods, interpretability, feature organization, Gaussian posteriors

Summary: 
The study introduces the variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE) as a method to improve feature organization and interpretability in neural network representations. By replacing deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporating KL divergence regularization, the vSAE aims to create more coherent feature organization in the latent space. However, evaluation on Pythia-70M transformer residual steam activations shows that the vSAE underperforms compared to a standard SAE, primarily due to excessive regularization pressure leading to a reduction in living features. While vSAE features exhibit improved robustness, they also have significantly more dead features compared to the baseline. The findings indicate that incorporating variational methods into SAEs may not necessarily enhance feature organization or interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse, human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench, individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics. The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness, they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature organization or interpretability.

<div> calibration, multiclass predictor, distribution, exponential, polynomial

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method for calibrating multiclass predictors that output a distribution over labels. This process is challenging due to the exponential number of possible prediction values. The proposed approach defines a new calibration error that bridges two existing calibration error notions, allowing calibration across a range of interpolation. The algorithm presented can calibrate any given predictor within this range using a polynomial number of samples. Notably, the method achieves near-optimal dependence on the error parameter, surpassing previous work. A key aspect of the approach involves the application of adaptive data analysis with a high level of adaptivity but minimal overhead in sample complexity. <div>

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels, is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint, using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work. A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

<div> Keywords: neural network models, classical mechanics, Symplectic Phase Space GAN, configuration space, trajectory prediction

Summary: 
Neural network models that incorporate classical mechanics principles are crucial for understanding the dynamics of systems evolving in time and space. The Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) introduced in this paper goes beyond capturing dynamics of a single system with fixed parameters. It can handle multiple systems and generalize to unseen physical parameters without prior knowledge of the configuration space. By embedding a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone, SPS-GAN achieves physically plausible generation. Additionally, the model can discover the structure of the configuration space from various measurement types. Through optimizing the conditional time-series GAN objective with a physically motivated term, SPS-GAN encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. The utility of SPS-GAN is demonstrated in trajectory prediction, video generation, and symmetry discovery, showcasing performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.

Summary: 
The paper introduces MoE-PHDS, a method for controlling global sparsity in pretrained Mixtures of Experts models. Traditionally, training multiple models at different sparsity levels leads to increased complexity in serving, training costs, and limits flexibility. MoE-PHDS allows practitioners to adjust sparsity levels at inference time without the need for multiple models or architectural changes. By mixing training data across sparsity levels and using a short curriculum at high sparsity, MoE-PHDS creates predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs in a single model. Experimental results on various MoE models demonstrate that PHDS matches or exceeds well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement, and simplifies the deployment of MoE models by making global sparsity a primary serving parameter.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently, meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity, requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\% vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

<div> sheaf theory, topological deep learning, message passing, Hodge Laplacian, cohomology<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
The essay discusses the application of sheaf theory in Topological Deep Learning (TDL), which aims to extend graph learning to more complex relational structures. It explores higher-order message passing using the Hodge Laplacian, which has biases related to combinatorial Laplacians. The essay suggests using sheaf Laplacian to enhance message passing by relating data features to sheaf cohomology. The existing sheaf diffusion theory in graph learning is examined and found lacking in generalizing to higher orders. The essay proposes novel theories and practices for higher-order settings. It also provides a comprehensive introduction to sheaves, from abstract concepts to practical applications. This approach offers a more expressive way of message passing in TDL, bridging local and global descriptors effectively. <div>
arXiv:2509.23020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$ (HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge (combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For $k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light -- and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the applied.

<div> Keywords: language models, geometric phases, eigenspectrum decay, autoregressive pretraining, downstream task performance <br>
Summary: 
This study explores the geometric phases of large language models during pretraining and post-training using a spectral approach. The research identifies three key phases: a "warmup" phase with rapid representational collapse, an "entropy-seeking" phase characterized by dimensional expansion and n-gram memorization, and a "compression-seeking" phase involving anisotropic consolidation. These phases result from the interplay of cross-entropy optimization and representational bottlenecks. Post-training transformations, including SFT, DPO, and RLVR, impact in-distribution performance, out-of-distribution robustness, reward alignment, and generation diversity. The study sheds light on the complex capabilities of language models and how their geometry evolves throughout the training process. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay ($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase, where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness. Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but reducing generation diversity.

<div> Catastrophic interference, machine learning, latent representation learning, identification problem, shared variables <br>
Summary: 
Catastrophic interference, a common challenge in machine learning, causes trained models to forget previously learned tasks when adapting to new ones. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that views catastrophic interference as an identification problem, quantifying forgetting as the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. By identifying shared latent variables between these setups, the forgetting phenomenon can be minimized. The proposed method, with a two-stage training strategy, uses maximum likelihood estimation to learn latent representations and optimize the KL divergence to identify shared latent variables. The approach offers both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across synthetic and benchmark datasets, effectively mitigating catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. <div>

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning, we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Summary: 
The Sixth-Generation (6G) network aims to incorporate artificial intelligence through federated learning (FL) on edge devices. A novel FL framework is proposed in this paper, integrating personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive model design. The framework utilizes sample-level representations and personalized DP strategies to protect training data and resist reconstruction attacks. It also implements a privacy-aware neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm to generate locally customized architectures and hyperparameters. This personalized DP solution offers theoretical convergence guarantees and outperforms existing methods in model performance. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show a 6.82% accuracy improvement over current methods, along with reduced model size and communication cost. <div>

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\% over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10 and communication cost to 1/20.

<div> framework, jailbreak prompts, detection, filtering, graph neural networks
Summary:
GuardNet is a hierarchical filtering framework designed to detect and filter jailbreak prompts before inference in Large Language Models (LLMs). It constructs structured graphs combining sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. GuardNet utilizes graph neural networks at prompt and token levels to identify global adversarial prompts and pinpoint fine-grained adversarial spans. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over prior defenses, with prompt-level F1 scores increasing from 66.4% to 99.8% on LLM-Fuzzer and 67-79% to over 94% on PLeak datasets. At the token level, F1 scores improve from 48-75% to 74-91% with IoU gains up to +28%. Despite its complexity, GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and (ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans. Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\% on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to 74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity, GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats in real-world LLM deployments.

Summary: 
The article introduces IsingFormer, a Transformer model trained on equilibrium samples to generate spin configurations for use in Monte Carlo methods. IsingFormer improves mixing in Markov Chain Monte Carlo by providing uncorrelated samples for global moves, reducing equilibration time in 2D Ising models and enhancing search in rugged landscapes such as 3D spin glasses. The model also demonstrates success in integer factorization tasks, transferring knowledge across unseen instances and boosting success rates. IsingFormer showcases the potential of neural proposals to accelerate Monte Carlo methods, leading to faster sampling and improved performance in combinatorial optimization. <div>
arXiv:2509.23043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

<div> Statistical heterogeneity, data privacy, federated learning, healthcare, empirical likelihood<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
Federated learning (FL) is being used in healthcare where data privacy is crucial. The challenge of statistical heterogeneity is addressed by proposing a new FL paradigm. The central server in this framework not only builds a model but also guides new queries to the most suitable client. An empirical likelihood-based approach is introduced to achieve two goals: creating effective local models on each client and matching new queries with the best client. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing enhancements in model accuracy and client guidance precision compared to standard FL methods. This work paves the way for more intelligent and efficient federated systems that capitalize on data heterogeneity as a strength rather than a limitation. <div>
arXiv:2509.23049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare, where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug.

Summary: 
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been successful in multimodal tasks but often rely heavily on their language prior (LP) instead of visual information. This study introduces a new approach to analyzing LP by investigating layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. The researchers found a consistent pattern across different models where there is a critical Visual Integration Point (VIP) where visual information starts influencing the model's behavior. They also developed the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator to quantify the strength of visual influence on response generation beyond the VIP. By examining 54 model-dataset combinations, they showed that the VIP and TVI can reliably predict the strength of the language prior in LVLMs. This analysis provides a systematic toolkit for understanding and diagnosing the influence of language prior in these models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces a new learning rate scheduler for neural network optimization that considers the training performance as a dynamical system. This scheduler utilizes training runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the training process and predicts the future learning rate schedule based on long-term validation performance. The novel scheduler deviates from common parametric functions, leading to state-of-the-art results in image classification and next-token prediction tasks. Models trained with this scheduler are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape, improving generalization compared to other schedules. The method is computationally efficient, works with various optimizers, and can be easily integrated with machine learning experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of the scheduler will be released after acceptance. <div>

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions. It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be made available after acceptance.

The Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP) and Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR) are introduced as metrics to measure forecasting difficulty and model effectiveness in exploiting predictable information within the data. Through this framework, the study reveals insights on predictability drift, showing that forecasting difficulty can vary over time, and highlights a key architectural trade-off between complex and linear models based on data predictability levels. The proposed framework advocates for a paradigm shift in evaluation metrics towards a more predictability-aware approach to foster fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting, progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards. However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.

<div> Transformer, Attention, Distillation, Continual Learning, Human Activity Recognition

Summary:<br><br>
The article introduces CLAD-Net, a framework designed to address the challenges of continual learning in human activity recognition using wearable sensors. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer for capturing global activity patterns and a supervised CNN trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. This allows the model to update continuously without sacrificing performance on past tasks. The framework achieves high accuracy on the PAMAP2 dataset with minimal forgetting, outperforming baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation. CLAD-Net demonstrates robustness to label scarcity, performing well even with only 10-20% labeled data. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module in contributing to the model's performance. Overall, CLAD-Net provides a promising approach for improving continual learning in human behavior monitoring using wearable sensors. <div>

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions - an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net (Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer, acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels. Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

<div> sigmoid function, weight initialization, trainability, expressivity, learning rate sensitivity

Summary: 
This research paper focuses on the interdependence between activation functions and weight initialization in neural networks. The study introduces a class of odd sigmoid functions and proposes a tailored initialization method for these functions to address issues such as saturation, variance collapse, and learning rate sensitivity. By selecting a noise scale in a closed form, the method ensures that forward activations remain well dispersed up to a target layer, preventing collapse to zero or saturation. The empirical results demonstrate that this approach can reliably train networks without the need for normalization layers, achieves strong data efficiency, and facilitates learning for activations that may struggle with standard initialization methods like Xavier, He, and Orthogonal. <div>

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However, activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation, variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation. Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers, exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not converge reliably.

Summary: Flow-based policies have shown promise in modeling complex behaviors in reinforcement learning. However, traditional critics bottleneck their potential by estimating a single return value. This study introduces the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), which learns the full state-action return distribution using flow matching. By transforming a simple base distribution to the target return distribution, DFC provides a rich learning signal for the flow-based policy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DFC, particularly in tasks with multimodal action distributions, and its superiority in offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods. The proposed approach paves the way for more stable and informative learning signals in reinforcement learning tasks. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex, multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics, which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance, especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

Summary:
This study investigates the latent knowledge within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) by analyzing hidden representations instead of focusing solely on task performance. The evaluation includes three parts: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Four state-of-the-art NFMs were tested on five diverse network datasets, revealing significant limitations such as anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, and an inability to separate high-level context and payload dependency. By addressing these limitations, model performance could be significantly improved without requiring architectural changes, with the potential for a +0.35 $F_1$ score improvement. <div>

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance. Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs, revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural changes).

<div> diffusion model, score function, training, perturbations, sensitivity

Summary: 
The article discusses the concept of training a diffusion model to approximate a map from a data distribution to the optimal score function. The authors explore the possibility of differentiating this map to predict how the score and model samples would change under small perturbations to the training set. By providing a closed-form procedure for computing the map's directional derivatives, they aim to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples to perturbations of its target measure with comparable runtime to sampling. The method is designed to be robust to numerical and approximation errors, allowing for reliable predictions of changes in an image diffusion model's samples after retraining and fine-tuning. <div>

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$ to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

Summary:<br>
The study introduces Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a method that enhances policy optimization for large language models (LLMs) by incorporating causal coherence into the training process. By estimating model-internal influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities and counterfactually hardening these signals, CE-PO aims to reduce reward hacking and improve the robustness of LLMs to causal perturbations. The framework combines accuracy and coherence feedback using a Minkowski combiner, allowing for a trade-off between the two. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that CE-PO improves accuracy by an average of 5.49% and enhances robustness to correlation-causation flips and counterfactual edits, without sacrificing accuracy. This approach offers a promising solution to address the challenges of spurious reasoning and unfaithful chain-of-thought in LLMs trained with reinforcement objectives.<br> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits.

<br>Summary: 
Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies offer secure value transfer but also pose challenges in detecting illicit activities like money laundering. To address this, a new ensemble framework combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) has been proposed for enhancing blockchain fraud detection. Using real-world data, the ensemble model achieved high recall of fraudulent transactions with a low false positive rate, outperforming individual models and baselines. The framework includes design hooks for future integration of quantum feature mappings, enabling scalability and adaptability as quantum computing advances. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of ensemble Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, offering immediate anti-money laundering (AML) support and paving the way for quantum-enhanced financial security analytics. <div>

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure, decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

This optimizer reduces memory usage by approximately 74% compared to full-precision Muon while maintaining stability under quantization. In various experiments, the 8-bit Muon exhibits performance on par with Muon, outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pretraining a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B model on post-training data.

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering $\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help explain this robustness under quantization.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces RHYTHM, a framework for predicting human mobility using large language models (LLMs) with hierarchical temporal tokenization. RHYTHM partitions trajectories into daily segments and encodes them as tokens with hierarchical attention to capture dependencies. It enhances token representations with pre-computed prompt embeddings and frozen LLMs to capture interdependencies. By freezing the LLM's backbone, RHYTHM reduces attention complexity and memory cost. Evaluations on real-world datasets show RHYTHM achieves improved accuracy, particularly on weekends, and reduces training time significantly.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.

Summary:
Impute-MACFM is a novel framework for imputing missing values in tabular data, specifically addressing longitudinal healthcare data where missing values are common. It focuses on three types of missingness mechanisms and utilizes a mask-aware conditional flow matching approach to accurately impute missing entries. The framework incorporates stability penalties on observed positions, consistency regularization for local invariance, and time-decayed noise injection for numeric features. Inference is performed using constraint-preserving ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix observed values. Impute-MACFM outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, efficiency, and imputation quality on various benchmarks. This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of flow matching techniques in dealing with tabular missing-data problems, particularly in longitudinal datasets.

arXiv:2509.23126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules. Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii) consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness. Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

The study introduces C$^2$GSPG, a confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method that enhances reasoning performance and reduces overconfidence in reinforcement learning models. The Group Sequence Policy Gradient framework is proposed to eliminate token-level bias common in existing methods. The model confidence for each reasoning problem is defined using normalized sequence-level probability, and a cross-entropy regularizer is used to calibrate model confidence to sequence reward. The collaborative nature of the confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG is highlighted for binary rewards, with nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping utilized for non-binary rewards to address potential conflicts. Application of C$^2$GSPG to large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrates superior performance in reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle, we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

arXiv:2509.23135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax) formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

arXiv:2509.23139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales, layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance across diverse signal processing applications.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all' context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Critique to Verify: Accurate and Honest Test-Time Scaling with RL-Trained Verifiers</title>

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals, paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning motivated by real-world applications.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults. Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1) routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on 6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive sensing.

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the 2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs) obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and, by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain. Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an effective paradigm for this domain.

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models, including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size, privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated design.

<title>Bridging the Gap Between Promise and Performance for Microscaling FP4 Quantization</title>

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and 2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically, we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time. Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of this paper are available at https://github.com/Bluixe/towards_monotonic_improvement .

Abstract: Understanding causality in event sequences with thousands of sparse event types is critical in domains such as healthcare, cybersecurity, or vehicle diagnostics, yet current methods fail to scale. We present OSCAR, a one-shot causal autoregressive method that infers per-sequence Markov Boundaries using two pretrained Transformers as density estimators. This enables efficient, parallel causal discovery without costly global CI testing. On a real-world automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless communications, where problems require precise manipulation of information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models (0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027 problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B +81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and AIME without any training on these tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

<title>More Data or Better Algorithms: Latent Diffusion Augmentation for Deep Imbalanced Regression</title>

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed, and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall accuracy.

<title>Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy for LLMs: Not All Tokens Require Equal Protection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23246</link>

arXiv:2509.23246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time, strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning, shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

arXiv:2509.23249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge, synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning (GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x. Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering, tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely targeted training datasets.

<title>ABConformer: Physics-inspired Sliding Attention for Antibody-Antigen Interface Prediction</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development. However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information. In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2) maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and (3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing, reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

<title>Transfer Learning and Machine Learning for Training Five Year Survival Prognostic Models in Early Breast Cancer</title>

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from 0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3 predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age, nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values, indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is likely.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic (LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning, we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4 performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations, including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

<title>ASTGI: Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interactions for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance, stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while remaining highly efficient.

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling, instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

<title>Robust Fine-Tuning from Non-Robust Pretrained Models: Mitigating Suboptimal Transfer With Adversarial Scheduling</title>

arXiv:2509.23325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer. Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem. We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces. Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms -- Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD) -- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical generative and design applications.

<title>Emergence of Superposition: Unveiling the Training Dynamics of Chain of Continuous Thought</title>

arXiv:2509.23365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT) improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions. The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the growth of logits further validate our theory.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures. We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$, $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression, removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

arXiv:2509.23373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

arXiv:2509.23405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths, planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work, we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap, we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective. Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols: cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL, HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

<title>PATCH: Learnable Tile-level Hybrid Sparsity for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere, preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap, we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles, assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU, PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method, MaskLLM.

<title>URS: A Unified Neural Routing Solver for Cross-Problem Zero-Shot Generalization</title>

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification, thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

<title>LOTFormer: Doubly-Stochastic Linear Attention via Low-Rank Optimal Transport</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23436</link>

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities. However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow. Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability. We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys) and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map. The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency.

<title>Better Hessians Matter: Studying the Impact of Curvature Approximations in Influence Functions</title>

arXiv:2509.23437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance. Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability and attribution accuracy.

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations. PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical (BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance. To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose \textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for \emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented \emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning, \textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP) consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time. Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of modern large-scale machine learning.

<title>Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS): Scalable Surrogate-Free Multi-Agent Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23462</link>

arXiv:2509.23462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs. We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts, multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster, has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

<title>Solve Smart, Not Often: Policy Learning for Costly MILP Re-solving</title>

arXiv:2509.23470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

<title>Drift-Adapter: A Practical Approach to Near Zero-Downtime Embedding Model Upgrades in Vector Databases</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23471</link>

arXiv:2509.23471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations: Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving, Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems, and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

arXiv:2509.23472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices, offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance.

arXiv:2509.23474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor $\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where $\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where $\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target functions.

arXiv:2509.23487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.

<title>Revisiting Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Missing Values</title>

arXiv:2509.23494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

<title>Beyond Outliers: A Study of Optimizers Under Quantization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2509.23500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio (MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient. In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

<title>Fusing Sequence Motifs and Pan-Genomic Features: Antimicrobial Resistance Prediction using an Explainable Lightweight 1D CNN-XGBoost Ensemble</title>

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis. While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds, assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets -- assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs' positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank *and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus* Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant (diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the deep learning Hessian.

<title>Toward a Holistic Approach to Continual Model Merging</title>

arXiv:2509.23592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

<title>Avoid Catastrophic Forgetting with Rank-1 Fisher from Diffusion Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23593</link>

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

<title>Characteristic Root Analysis and Regularization for Linear Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/flzeng1/GraphIFE.

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a 3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets, eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models face memory and PCIe latency bottlenecks when deployed on commodity hardware. Offloading expert weights to CPU memory results in PCIe transfer latency that exceeds GPU computation by several folds. We present PreScope, a prediction-driven expert scheduling system that addresses three key challenges: inaccurate activation prediction, PCIe bandwidth competition, and cross-device scheduling complexity. Our solution includes: 1) Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) that captures layer-specific expert activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) that generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from computation, eliminating waiting bubbles. PreScope achieves 141% higher throughput and 74.6% lower latency than state-of-the-art solutions.

<title>Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Efficient Long-Range Information Aggregation</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at https://github.com/flzeng1/PNS.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds, and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework, enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop (<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Div290/UAT.

<title>Why Alignment Must Precede Distillation: A Minimal Working Explanation</title>

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact, knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD -> Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment must precede distillation.

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN). DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore, a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size ($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)). Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model design and training.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features, but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging, or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features, hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and predictive across domains.

<title>FedDAPL: Toward Client-Private Generalization in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG) offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted 3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79 y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15 sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

<title>Merge Now, Regret Later: The Hidden Cost of Model Merging is Adversarial Transferability</title>

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336 distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing MM.

<title>Estimating Time Series Foundation Model Transferability via In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target) dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers, capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3 forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

<title>Bridging Discrete and Continuous RL: Stable Deterministic Policy Gradient with Martingale Characterization</title>

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments, many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them. We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

<title>A Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network for Continuous Intraoperative Hypotension Prediction</title>

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for practical clinical applications.

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data. This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

<title>An Investigation of Batch Normalization in Off-Policy Actor-Critic Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel, task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks, SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing, and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling. Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by experimental simulation.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations, resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility. Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline, providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective, architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g., navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks. Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating stage misalignment.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals), (b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6 modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy, Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium, and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3 can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for even the strongest models.

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV) and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method, Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off, VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

<title>Tequila: Trapping-free Ternary Quantization for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct, meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

<title>IndexNet: Timestamp and Variable-Aware Modeling for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric, stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned, equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target, we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

<title>Bayesian Mixture-of-Experts: Towards Making LLMs Know What They Don't Know</title>

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured \textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single, deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space}, and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know what they don't know.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training, effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

<title>Efficient Multi-turn RL for GUI Agents via Decoupled Training and Adaptive Data Curation</title>

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner. DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput, and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1) pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

<title>Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer</title>

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example, a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage. Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically, divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly, finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale, complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent method.

<title>Dynamic Orthogonal Continual Fine-tuning for Mitigating Catastrophic Forgettings</title>

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for continuous LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose $D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the $L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

<title>Integrated Communication and Control for Energy-Efficient UAV Swarms: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking (MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable, domain-aligned explanations.

<title>HiViS: Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models (VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs. First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup, confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction, offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters during inference. However, current research remains largely performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms, thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity, dynamics, and specialization of MoE models.

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction, and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static, non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended, natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation. These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible interfaces between brain activity and language.

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding, supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

<title>Explore-Execute Chain: Towards an Efficient Structured Reasoning Paradigm</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches 58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are available at: https://github.com/yks23/Explore-Execute-Chain.git

<title>DiBS-MTL: Transformation-Invariant Multitask Learning with Direction Oracles</title>

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL, a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior bargaining-inspired MTL methods.

<title>Evaluating the Robustness of Chinchilla Compute-Optimal Scaling</title>

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches, and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation, the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall, Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide for scaling language models.

<title>Detecting and Rectifying Noisy Labels: A Similarity-based Approach</title>

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training. As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc, model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of datasets.

<title>Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Synthesizing Gas-Efficient Financial Derivatives Contracts</title>

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM), remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to 35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability, computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges, exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization (accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where baseline methods fail.

<title>Does Weak-to-strong Generalization Happen under Spurious Correlations?</title>

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$. Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures, we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

<title>SLA: Beyond Sparsity in Diffusion Transformers via Fine-Tunable Sparse-Linear Attention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24006</link>

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation, attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

<title>Pretraining Scaling Laws for Generative Evaluations of Language Models</title>

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning, driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute. While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1) We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting, $k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small $k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative performance.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.

<title>Optimism as Risk-Seeking in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results, confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for a resource-efficient application of the method.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning (\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels. Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL} substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\% and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning \texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'', ``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth} explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data, probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like'' use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000 time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions (median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture density.

<title>Demographic-Agnostic Fairness without Harm</title>

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is \textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed method.

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D) communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks, at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving ${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU memory size, speed, and accuracy.

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries. Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive, especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder (GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model baselines.

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes, their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data. Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at: https://github.com/healthylaife/HyMaTE.

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge: how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex, neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh, ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

<title>The Impossibility of Inverse Permutation Learning in Transformer Models</title>

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original (``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval, multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture. The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate ``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of intermediate computations).

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a document dataset.

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for unlearning in LLMs.

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another. Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models. Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing, avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23 PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72% while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal, sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss, and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is available at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/rec_gsm8k.

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability, hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000 samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081, significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and 34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader applications in mental health care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on https://github.com/jie040109/Conda

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters, fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows. By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing sector.

<title>Accessible, Realistic, and Fair Evaluation of Positive-Unlabeled Learning Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However, experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e., the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities. However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension, and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance, approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

<title>Graph Foundation Models: Bridging Language Model Paradigms and Graph Optimization</title>

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.

<title>Adversarial Reinforcement Learning Framework for ESP Cheater Simulation</title>

arXiv:2509.24274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which further complicates detection and detector development. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing effective cheat detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces. The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms, Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

<title>A study of Universal ODE approaches to predicting soil organic carbon</title>

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical, chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases, progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%) multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5, and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 = 0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.

<title>AuON: A Linear-time Alternative to Semi-Orthogonal Momentum Updates</title>

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon, improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

<title>H+: An Efficient Similarity-Aware Aggregation for Byzantine Resilient Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server. Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data, i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects $r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data. Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios and benchmark datasets.

arXiv:2509.24332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

<title>Expanding Horizons of Level Diversity via Multi-objective Evolutionary Learning</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros. demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics, including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and designers.

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models (DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters, was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

<title>AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M - 200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$ inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and large-batch training regimes.

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/jk-sounds/ScatterAD.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy. Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore, their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large language models(LLM). The models are divided into several experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set. However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation. KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses, and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency. Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate through dedicated analysis.

<title>FS-KAN: Permutation Equivariant Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks via Function Sharing</title>

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries, significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers, allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

<title>One-Prompt Strikes Back: Sparse Mixture of Experts for Prompt-based Continual Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.24483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning (CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task, which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely, approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input, only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational costs.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and reliability.

arXiv:2509.24496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional, bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable, training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

<title>Specialization after Generalization: Towards Understanding Test-Time Training in Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.

arXiv:2509.24517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration driving machine learning model development and deployment.

arXiv:2509.24547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing, Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results, existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text. The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight, plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and long-context problems.

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80% vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines (embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

<title>Learning to Solve Optimization Problems Constrained with Partial Differential Equations</title>

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables, and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints. This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable, estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone. SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains (e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches: (1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression, classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains. For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to 90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns, achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared error than competing models.

<title>Evaluating classification performance across operating contexts: A comparison of decision curve analysis and cost curves</title>

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related, and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds, differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be achieved through recalibration alone.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that: I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from 34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless, and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of 13.96%.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions. Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to high-dimensional physical systems.

<title>Identity Bridge: Enabling Implicit Reasoning via Shared Latent Memory</title>

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However, current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2) practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions, enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However, discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations, such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for ImageNet 256.

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated. Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i) vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments. Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays. Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar. Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1) revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the $\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$ is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases. Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

<title>A TRIANGLE Enables Multimodal Alignment Beyond Cosine Similarity</title>

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales. Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

<title>Robust Policy Expansion for Offline-to-Online RL under Diverse Data Corruption</title>

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed $\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system. We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets.
  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content, known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

<title>MarS-FM: Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics via Markov State Models</title>

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues) with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events, and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing methods, often by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Imitation learning benchmarks often lack sufficient variation between training and evaluation, limiting meaningful generalisation assessment. We introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task complexity. It enables verifiably distinct training, evaluation, and test settings. Labyrinth provides a discrete, fully observable state space and known optimal actions, supporting interpretability and fine-grained evaluation. Its flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards. By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool for developing more robust agents.

<title>Assessing the risk of future Dunkelflaute events for Germany using generative deep learning</title>

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6 ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low (SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios, the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress. Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity, strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks. Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in multimodal forecasting.

<title>DSAT-HD: Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer with Hybrid Decomposition for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24800</link>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather, traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner, enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer scenarios.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation due to data dependence.

<title>DyMoDreamer: World Modeling with Dynamic Modulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2509.24804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model (RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\% performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation. These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around 0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy, maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other models.

<title>DRIFT-Net: A Spectral--Coupled Neural Operator for PDEs Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24868</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2509.24868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers. In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose \textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of this design. The code is available at https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/DRIFT-Net.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models, offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to $\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles. We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code and experiments can be found in our repository: https://github.com/calgo-lab/BGR

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning, yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning, enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form. Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.

<title>Towards Understanding the Shape of Representations in Protein Language Models</title>

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these layers might lead to improved folding performance.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents, they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance, and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models, prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust exploratory behavior.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However, finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods, raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for antibodies.

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT), developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT. Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in various generative tasks.

<title>Learning Distinguishable Representations in Deep Q-Networks for Linear Transfer</title>

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage the internal representations learned by the neural network during training. Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby reducing computational overhead.

<title>Intra-request branch orchestration for efficient LLM reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt. Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However, state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

<title>Double Descent as a Lens for Sample Efficiency in Autoregressive vs. Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models. We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets, while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient capacity and compute.

<title>Random Policy Valuation is Enough for LLM Reasoning with Verifiable Rewards</title>

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO, which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse, requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1, \textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

<title>Sampling Complexity of TD and PPO in RKHS</title>

arXiv:2509.24991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference (TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic, instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes, and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal $k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy improvement with practical efficiency.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples, such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters ($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion process

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Deep Learning for Wildfire Danger Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger; however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

<title>MARCOS: Deep Thinking by Markov Chain of Continuous Thoughts</title>

arXiv:2509.25020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought (CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks. Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN) surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio, the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space, an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results with some simulations.

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance, where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO), optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce \textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect, AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO (which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX, without compromising generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/advantage_weighted_matching.

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based scientific predictions.

<title>Scaling with Collapse: Efficient and Predictable Training of LLM Families</title>

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities -- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*, where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget, in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Un- like standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over conventional black-box KD baselines.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks, which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However, existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic, procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback under dynamic experimental conditions.

However, it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence. Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

<title>Learning in an Echo Chamber: Online Learning with Replay Adversary</title>

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis $\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$, and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model. A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is (almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers $\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for closure-type algorithms.

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware. Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1 accuracy drop.

<title>High-Dimensional Analysis of Single-Layer Attention for Sparse-Token Classification</title>

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime, where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear baselines.

<title>Chance-constrained Flow Matching for High-Fidelity Constraint-aware Generation</title>

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold. Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching (CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process, enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii) complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation. Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

<title>GLASS Flows: Transition Sampling for Alignment of Flow and Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single- and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models, highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity, such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights, we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55 proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

<title>SIRI: Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved Compression</title>

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal "sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that large language models (LLMs) underperform on mathematical and computer science tasks when these problems are translated from Romanian into English, compared to their original Romanian format. Accurate translation is critical for applications ranging from automatic translations in programming competitions to the creation of high-quality educational materials, as well as minimizing errors or fraud in human translations. This study shows that robust large language models (LLMs) can maintain or even enhance their performance in translating less common languages when given well-structured prompts. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with appropriate supervision, can be reliably used for the automatic translation of IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)-style tasks. We evaluate several translation methods across multiple LLMs, including OpenRoLLM, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.2 3B and GPT-4o, assessing their translation accuracy and performance stability through repeated runs. Additionally, we augment the OJI (Romanian County-Level Informatics Olympiad) Romanian dataset with accurate English translations, enhancing its utility for future LLM training and evaluation. Through detailed syntactic and semantic analyses, we confirm that with human oversight, LLMs can serve as a viable solution for multilingual problem-solving. We also compare the translation quality of LLMs against human translators, as evaluated by a certified expert, underscoring the potential of LLMs in realworld scenarios.

Abstract: Accessing quality preparation and feedback for the Romanian Bacalaureat exam is challenging, particularly for students in remote or underserved areas. This paper introduces BacPrep, an experimental online platform exploring Large Language Model (LLM) potential for automated assessment, aiming to offer a free, accessible resource. Using official exam questions from the last 5 years, BacPrep employs one of Google's newest models, Gemini 2.0 Flash (released Feb 2025), guided by official grading schemes, to provide experimental feedback. Currently operational, its primary research function is collecting student solutions and LLM outputs. This focused dataset is vital for planned expert validation to rigorously evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of this cutting-edge LLM in the specific Bacalaureat context before reliable deployment. We detail the design, data strategy, status, validation plan, and ethics.

Abstract: Competitive programming contests play a crucial role in cultivating computational thinking and algorithmic skills among learners. However, generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for 5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich, multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs, enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology, history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image) dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian), providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate, university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i) selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3 orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in jet classification tasks, yet a key challenge remains: understanding what these models learn and how their features relate to known QCD observables. Improving interpretability is essential for building robust and trustworthy machine learning tools in collider physics. To address this challenge, we investigate graph neural networks for quark-gluon discrimination, systematically incorporating physics-motivated inductive biases. In particular, we design message-passing architectures that enforce infrared and collinear (IRC) safety, as well as E(2) and O(2) equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane. Using simulated jet datasets, we compare these networks against unconstrained baselines in terms of classification performance, robustness to soft emissions, and latent representation structures. Our analysis shows that physics-aware networks are more stable across training instances and distribute their latent variance across multiple interpretable directions. By regressing Energy Flow Polynomials onto the leading principal components, we establish a direct correspondence between learned representations and established IRC-safe jet observables. These results demonstrate that embedding symmetry and safety constraints not only improves robustness but also grounds network representations in known QCD structures, providing a principled approach toward interpretable deep learning in collider physics.

Abstract: Customer churn prediction in the telecommunications sector represents a critical business intelligence task that has evolved from subjective human assessment to sophisticated algorithmic approaches. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for telecommunications churn prediction leveraging deep neural networks. Through systematic problem formulation, rigorous dataset analysis, and careful feature engineering, we develop a model that captures complex patterns in customer behavior indicative of potential churn. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations across multiple performance metrics, demonstrating that our proposed neural architecture achieves significant improvements over existing baseline methods. Our approach not only advances the state-of-the-art in churn prediction accuracy but also provides interpretable insights into the key factors driving customer attrition in telecommunications services.

Abstract: West Nile virus is a significant, and growing, public health issue in the United States. With no human vaccine, mosquito control programs rely on accurate forecasting to determine when and where WNV will emerge. Recently, spatial Graph neural networks (GNNs) were shown to be a powerful tool for WNV forecasting, significantly improving over traditional methods. Building on this work, we introduce a new GNN variant that linearly connects graph attention layers, allowing us to train much larger models than previously used for WNV forecasting. This architecture specializes general densely connected GNNs so that the model focuses more heavily on local information to prevent over smoothing. To support training large GNNs we compiled a massive new dataset of weather data, land use information, and mosquito trap results across Illinois. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms both GNN and classical baselines in both out-of-sample and out-of-graph WNV prediction skill across a variety of scenarios and over all prediction horizons.

<title>A Comparison of Surrogate Constitutive Models for Viscoplastic Creep Simulation of HT-9 Steel</title>

Abstract: Mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models for the mechanical response of polycrystals are a cornerstone of computational materials science. However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive, particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable. Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage, using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface method in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks aim to exploit semantic awareness to optimize radio resources. By optimizing the transmission through the lens of the desired goal, the energy consumption of transmissions can also be reduced, and the latency can be improved. To that end, this paper investigates a paradigm in which the capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) on the edge are harnessed for network optimization. In particular, we investigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) handover framework that takes advantage of GenAI and semantic communication to maintain reliable connectivity. To that end, we propose a framework in which a lightweight MobileBERT language model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), is deployed on the UAV. This model processes multi-attribute flight and radio measurements and performs multi-label classification to determine appropriate handover action. Concurrently, the model identifies an appropriate set of contextual "Reason Tags" that elucidate the decision's rationale. Our model, evaluated on a rule-based synthetic dataset of UAV handover scenarios, demonstrates the model's high efficacy in learning these rules, achieving high accuracy in predicting the primary handover decision. The model also shows strong performance in identifying supporting reasons, with an F1 micro-score of approximately 0.9 for reason tags.

<title>PISA: An AI Pipeline for Interpretable-by-design Survival Analysis Providing Multiple Complexity-Accuracy Trade-off Models</title>

Abstract: Survival analysis is central to clinical research, informing patient prognoses, guiding treatment decisions, and optimising resource allocation. Accurate time-to-event predictions not only improve quality of life but also reveal risk factors that shape clinical practice. For these models to be relevant in healthcare, interpretability is critical: predictions must be traceable to patient-specific characteristics, and risk factors should be identifiable to generate actionable insights for both clinicians and researchers. Traditional survival models often fail to capture non-linear interactions, while modern deep learning approaches, though powerful, are limited by poor interpretability.
  We propose a Pipeline for Interpretable Survival Analysis (PISA) - a pipeline that provides multiple survival analysis models that trade off complexity and performance. Using multiple-feature, multi-objective feature engineering, PISA transforms patient characteristics and time-to-event data into multiple survival analysis models, providing valuable insights into the survival prediction task. Crucially, every model is converted into simple patient stratification flowcharts supported by Kaplan-Meier curves, whilst not compromising on performance. While PISA is model-agnostic, we illustrate its flexibility through applications of Cox regression and shallow survival trees, the latter avoiding proportional hazards assumptions.
  Applied to two clinical benchmark datasets, PISA produced interpretable survival models and intuitive stratification flowcharts whilst achieving state-of-the-art performances. Revisiting a prior departmental study further demonstrated its capacity to automate survival analysis workflows in real-world clinical research.

<title>Profit over Proxies: A Scalable Bayesian Decision Framework for Optimizing Multi-Variant Online Experiments</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22677</link>

Abstract: Online controlled experiments (A/B tests) are fundamental to data-driven decision-making in the digital economy. However, their real-world application is frequently compromised by two critical shortcomings: the use of statistically flawed heuristics like "p-value peeking", which inflates false positive rates, and an over-reliance on proxy metrics like conversion rates, which can lead to decisions that inadvertently harm core business profitability. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive and scalable Bayesian decision framework designed for profit optimization in multi-variant (A/B/n) experiments.
  We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously estimates the probability of conversion (using a Beta-Bernoulli model) and the monetary value of that conversion (using a robust Bayesian model for the mean transaction value). Building on this, we employ a decision-theoretic stopping rule based on Expected Loss, enabling experiments to be concluded not only when a superior variant is identified but also when it becomes clear that no variant offers a practically significant improvement (stopping for futility). The framework successfully navigates "revenue traps" where a variant with a higher conversion rate would have resulted in a net financial loss, correctly terminates futile experiments early to conserve resources, and maintains strict statistical integrity throughout the monitoring process.
  Ultimately, this work provides a practical and principled methodology for organizations to move beyond simple A/B testing towards a mature, profit-driven experimentation culture, ensuring that statistical conclusions translate directly to strategic business value.

<title>Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697</link>

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI), the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives, along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07 percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa ($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters, nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

Abstract: This study presents a machine learning-assisted approach to optimize task scheduling in cluster systems, focusing on node-affinity constraints. Traditional schedulers like Kubernetes struggle with real-time adaptability, whereas the proposed continuous transfer learning model evolves dynamically during operations, minimizing retraining needs. Evaluated on Google Cluster Data, the model achieves over 99% accuracy, reducing computational overhead and improving scheduling latency for constrained tasks. This scalable solution enables real-time optimization, advancing machine learning integration in cluster management and paving the way for future adaptive scheduling strategies.

Abstract: Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling is essential for enhancing energy efficiency in mobile platforms. However, traditional heuristic-based governors are increasingly inadequate for managing the complexity of heterogeneous System-on-Chip designs and diverse application workloads. Although reinforcement learning approaches offer improved performance, their poor generalization capability and reliance on extensive retraining for each hardware and application combination leads to significant deployment costs. In this work, we observe that device and application metadata inherently encapsulate valuable knowledge for DVFS, presenting an opportunity to overcome these limitations. We formulate DVFS for heterogeneous devices and applications as a multi-task reinforcement learning problem. We introduce MetaDVFS, which is a metadata-guided framework that systematically leverages metadata to discover and transfer shared knowledge across DVFS tasks. MetaDVFS can output a set of DVFS models with significant generalization capability for various applications of heterogeneous devices. Evaluations on five Google Pixel devices running six applications show that MetaDVFS achieves up to 17% improvement in Performance-Power Ratio and up to 26% improvement in Quality of Experience. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MetaDVFS delivers 70.8% faster adaptation and 5.8-27.6% higher performance over standalone device-application specific training, while avoiding negative transfer effects. These results establish MetaDVFS as an effective and scalable solution for DVFS deployment in heterogeneous mobile environments.

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts (GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset (CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance performance on both seen and unseen classes.

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation. These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT), are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the explainability Transformers.

<title>LayoutAgent: A Vision-Language Agent Guided Compositional Diffusion for Spatial Layout Planning</title>

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images, but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency, but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation. Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Abstract: Digital transformation (DT) has become a strategic priority for public administrations, particularly due to the need to deliver more efficient and citizen-centered services and respond to societal expectations, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). In this context, the main objective of this study is to propose an innovative methodology to automatically evaluate the level of digital transformation (DT) in public sector organizations. The proposed approach combines traditional assessment methods with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The methodology follows a dual approach: on the one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain) and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and dual-source data foundation support its international scalability, acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii) the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT, sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient, agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and sustainable Smart City models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.

Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only (Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of 0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint distribution.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks; we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8% on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

The main intention is to derive learning rates for the excess misclassification error according to the convex $\eta$-norm loss function $\phi(v)=(1 - v)_{+}^{\eta}$, $\eta\geq1$. Following the argument, the estimation of error under Tsybakov noise conditions is studied. In addition, we propose the rate of $L_p$ approximation of functions from Korobov space $X^{2, p}([-1,1]^{d})$, $1\leq p \leq \infty$, by the shallow ReLU neural network.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is a central challenge in machine learning when tasks lack ground truth labels or involve ambiguity and noise. Conventional frameworks, rooted in the Cranfield paradigm and label-based metrics, fail in such cases because they cannot assess how robustly a system performs under uncertain interpretations. We introduce VB-Score, a variance-bounded evaluation framework that measures both effectiveness and robustness without requiring ground truth. Given a query or input, VB-Score enumerates plausible interpretations, assigns probabilities, and evaluates output by expected success penalized by variance, rewarding consistent performance across intents. We provide a formal analysis of VB-Score, establishing range, monotonicity, and stability properties, and relate it to risk-sensitive measures such as mean-variance utility. Experiments on ambiguous queries and entity-centric retrieval tasks show that VB-Score surfaces robustness differences hidden by conventional metrics. By enabling reproducible, label-free evaluation, VB-Score offers a principled foundation for benchmarking machine learning systems in ambiguous or label-scarce domains.

Abstract: Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are a tool from explainable AI, offering a promising approach for understanding how human-understandable concepts are encoded in a model's latent spaces. They are computed from hidden-layer activations of inputs belonging either to a concept class or to non-concept examples. Adopting a probabilistic perspective, the distribution of the (non-)concept inputs induces a distribution over the CAV, making it a random vector in the latent space. This enables us to derive mean and covariance for different types of CAVs, leading to a unified theoretical view. This probabilistic perspective also reveals a potential vulnerability: CAVs can strongly depend on the rather arbitrary non-concept distribution, a factor largely overlooked in prior work. We illustrate this with a simple yet effective adversarial attack, underscoring the need for a more systematic study.

<title>Identifying Memory Effects in Epidemics via a Fractional SEIRD Model and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for parameter estimation in fractional-order SEIRD epidemic models. By embedding the Caputo fractional derivative into the network residuals via the L1 discretization scheme, our method simultaneously reconstructs epidemic trajectories and infers both epidemiological parameters and the fractional memory order $\alpha$. The fractional formulation extends classical integer-order models by capturing long-range memory effects in disease progression, incubation, and recovery. Our framework learns the fractional memory order $\alpha$ as a trainable parameter while simultaneously estimating the epidemiological rates $(\beta, \sigma, \gamma, \mu)$. A composite loss combining data misfit, physics residuals, and initial conditions, with constraints on positivity and population conservation, ensures both accuracy and biological consistency. Tests on synthetic Mpox data confirm reliable recovery of $\alpha$ and parameters under noise, while applications to COVID-19 show that optimal $\alpha \in (0, 1]$ captures memory effects and improves predictive performance over the classical SEIRD model. This work establishes PINNs as a robust tool for learning memory effects in epidemic dynamics, with implications for forecasting, control strategies, and the analysis of non-Markovian epidemic processes.

<title>UESA-Net: U-Shaped Embedded Multidirectional Shrinkage Attention Network for Ultrasound Nodule Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) - UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of the SyncRank algorithm for recovering a global ranking from noisy pairwise comparisons. By adopting a complex-valued data model where the true ranking is encoded in the phases of a unit-modulus vector, we establish a sharp non-asymptotic recovery guarantee for the associated semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Our main theorem characterizes a critical noise threshold - scaling as sigma = O(sqrt(n / log n)) - below which SyncRank achieves exact ranking recovery with high probability. Extensive experiments under this model confirm the theoretical predictions and demonstrate the algorithm's robustness across varying problem sizes and noise regimes.

Abstract: We study instrumental variable regression (IVaR) under differential privacy constraints. Classical IVaR methods (like two-stage least squares regression) rely on solving moment equations that directly use sensitive covariates and instruments, creating significant risks of privacy leakage and posing challenges in designing algorithms that are both statistically efficient and differentially private. We propose a noisy two-state gradient descent algorithm that ensures $\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among privacy parameters, sample size, and iteration-complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide both privacy guarantees and provable convergence rates for instrumental variable regression in linear models. We further validate our theoretical findings with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that our method offers practical accuracy-privacy trade-offs.

Abstract: Open-source software projects are foundational to modern software ecosystems, with the Linux kernel standing out as a critical exemplar due to its ubiquity and complexity. Although security patches are continuously integrated into the Linux mainline kernel, downstream maintainers often delay their adoption, creating windows of vulnerability. A key reason for this lag is the difficulty in identifying security-critical patches, particularly those addressing exploitable vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds (OOB) accesses and use-after-free (UAF) bugs. This challenge is exacerbated by intentionally silent bug fixes, incomplete or missing CVE assignments, delays in CVE issuance, and recent changes to the CVE assignment criteria for the Linux kernel. While fine-grained patch classification approaches exist, they exhibit limitations in both coverage and accuracy. In this work, we identify previously unexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch classification. Specifically, by leveraging cues from commit titles/messages and diffs alongside appropriate code context, we develop DUALLM, a dual-method pipeline that integrates two approaches based on a Large Language Model (LLM) and a fine-tuned small language model. DUALLM achieves 87.4% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.875, significantly outperforming prior solutions. Notably, DUALLM successfully identified 111 of 5,140 recent Linux kernel patches as addressing OOB or UAF vulnerabilities, with 90 true positives confirmed by manual verification (many do not have clear indications in patch descriptions). Moreover, we constructed proof-of-concepts for two identified bugs (one UAF and one OOB), including one developed to conduct a previously unknown control-flow hijack as further evidence of the correctness of the classification.

<title>Hilbert: Recursively Building Formal Proofs with Informal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4 tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM. It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models(LLMs) is one of the most compute-intensive tasks in high-performance computing. Predicting end-to-end training time for multi-billion parameter models distributed across hundreds of GPUs remains challenging due to complex interactions between transformer components, parallelism strategies(data, model, pipeline, tensor), and multi-tier communication. Learned models require costly sampling, while analytical models often struggle with real-world network and hardware complexities. We address this by decomposing LLMs into core computational primitives and modeling them with: (1) operator-level decomposition for fine-grained analysis; (2) lightweight sampling based hardware-aware prediction models for key operations; (3) an end-to-end prediction system integrating these components across complex parallelization strategies. Crucially, our methodology has been validated on two large-scale HPC systems. Our framework achieves low average prediction errors-4.98\% on Perlmutter(A100) and 9.38\% on Vista(GH200)-for models up to 20B parameters across 128 GPUs. Importantly, it runs entirely on CPUs, enabling rapid iteration over hardware configurations and training strategies without costly on-cluster experimentation.

Abstract: Speaker identification has become a crucial component in various applications, including security systems, virtual assistants, and personalized user experiences. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of CosFace Loss and ArcFace Loss for text-independent speaker identification using a Convolutional Neural Network architecture based on the VGG16 model, modified to accommodate mel spectrogram inputs of variable sizes generated from the Voxceleb1 dataset. Our approach involves implementing both loss functions to analyze their effects on model accuracy and robustness, where the Softmax loss function was employed as a comparative baseline. Additionally, we examine how the sizes of mel spectrograms and their varying time lengths influence model performance. The experimental results demonstrate superior identification accuracy compared to traditional Softmax loss methods. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for future research.

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across datasets of varying complexity.

Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election \textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the \textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

Abstract: Asynchronous stochastic gradient methods are central to scalable distributed optimization, particularly when devices differ in computational capabilities. Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions. However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of asynchronous optimization.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning. However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise, emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam, and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Abstract: Mixture models, such as Gaussian mixture models, are widely used in machine learning to represent complex data distributions. A key challenge, especially in high-dimensional settings, is to determine the mixture order and estimate the mixture parameters. We study the problem of approximating a target measure, available only through finitely many of its moments, by a mixture of distributions from a parametric family (e.g., Gaussian, exponential, Poisson), with approximation quality measured by the 2-Wasserstein or the total variation distance. Unlike many existing approaches, the parameter set is not assumed to be finite; it is modeled as a compact basic semi-algebraic set. We introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations with asymptotic convergence to the desired optimal value. In addition, when a certain rank condition is satisfied, the convergence is even finite and recovery of an optimal mixing measure is obtained. We also present an application to clustering, where our framework serves either as a stand-alone method or as a preprocessing step that yields both the number of clusters and strong initial parameter estimates, thereby accelerating convergence of standard (local) clustering algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor, typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet (https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Abstract: We present and test the largest benchmark for vericoding, LLM-generation of formally verified code from formal specifications - in contrast to vibe coding, which generates potentially buggy code from a natural language description. Our benchmark contains 12,504 formal specifications, with 3,029 in Dafny, 2,334 in Verus/Rust and 7,141 in Lean. Of these, 6,174 are new unseen problems. We find vericoding success rates of 27% in Lean, 44% in Verus/Rust and 82% in Dafny using off-the-shelf LLMs. Adding natural-language descriptions does not significantly improve performance. We also find that LLM progress has improved progress on pure Dafny verification from 68% to 96% over the past year. The benchmark and vericoding results are shared at https://github.com/Beneficial-AI-Foundation/vericoding-benchmark

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20 different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5 IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123 FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are available at https://www.github.com/moured/TY-RIST

Abstract: Missing data is a common problem in time series data. Most methods for imputation ignore label information pertaining to the time series even if that information exists. In this paper, we provide a framework for missing data imputation in the context of time series classification, where each time series is associated with a categorical label. We define a means of imputing missing values conditional upon labels, the method being guided by powerful, existing supervised models designed for high accuracy in this task. From each model, we extract a tree-based proximity measure from which imputation can be applied. We show that imputation using this method generally provides richer information leading to higher classification accuracies, despite the imputed values differing from the true values.

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution. Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen), Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Abstract: In machine learning, uncertainty quantification helps assess the reliability of model predictions, which is important in high-stakes scenarios. Traditional approaches often emphasize predictive accuracy, but there is a growing focus on incorporating uncertainty measures. This paper addresses localized uncertainty quantification in random forests. While current methods often rely on quantile regression or Monte Carlo techniques, we propose a new approach using naturally occurring test sets and similarity measures (proximities) typically viewed as byproducts of random forests. Specifically, we form localized distributions of OOB errors around nearby points, defined using the proximities, to create prediction intervals for regression and trust scores for classification. By varying the number of nearby points, our intervals can be adjusted to achieve the desired coverage while retaining the flexibility that reflects the certainty of individual predictions. For classification, excluding points identified as unclassifiable by our method generally enhances the accuracy of the model and provides higher accuracy-rejection AUC scores than competing methods.

<title>What Matters More For In-Context Learning under Matched Compute Budgets: Pretraining on Natural Text or Incorporating Targeted Synthetic Examples?</title>

Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii) head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests (e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall, inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely present, structure.

Abstract: We introduce RoLA, a framework that transforms any in-the-wild image into an interactive, physics-enabled robotic environment. Unlike previous methods, RoLA operates directly on a single image without requiring additional hardware or digital assets. Our framework democratizes robotic data generation by producing massive visuomotor robotic demonstrations within minutes from a wide range of image sources, including camera captures, robotic datasets, and Internet images. At its core, our approach combines a novel method for single-view physical scene recovery with an efficient visual blending strategy for photorealistic data collection. We demonstrate RoLA's versatility across applications like scalable robotic data generation and augmentation, robot learning from Internet images, and single-image real-to-sim-to-real systems for manipulators and humanoids.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: Deploying black-box LLMs requires managing uncertainty in the absence of token-level probability or true labels. We propose introducing an unsupervised conformal inference framework for generation, which integrates: generative models, incorporating: (i) an LLM-compatible atypical score derived from response-embedding Gram matrix, (ii) UCP combined with a bootstrapping variant (BB-UCP) that aggregates residuals to refine quantile precision while maintaining distribution-free, finite-sample coverage, and (iii) conformal alignment, which calibrates a single strictness parameter $\tau$ so a user predicate (e.g., factuality lift) holds on unseen batches with probability $\ge 1-\alpha$. Across different benchmark datasets, our gates achieve close-to-nominal coverage and provide tighter, more stable thresholds than split UCP, while consistently reducing the severity of hallucination, outperforming lightweight per-response detectors with similar computational demands. The result is a label-free, API-compatible gate for test-time filtering that turns geometric signals into calibrated, goal-aligned decisions.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model \(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i) multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation; (ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp 0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small, human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies. Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial, frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/bloomingvision/FMC-DETR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning highlight the need for personalized models that can learn from small or moderate samples, handle high dimensional features, and remain interpretable. To address this challenge, we propose the Sparse Deep Additive Model with Interactions (SDAMI), a framework that combines sparsity driven feature selection with deep subnetworks for flexible function approximation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, which often function as black boxes, SDAMI explicitly disentangles main effects and interaction effects to enhance interpretability. At the same time, its deep additive structure achieves higher predictive accuracy than classical additive models. Central to SDAMI is the concept of an Effect Footprint, which assumes that higher order interactions project marginally onto main effects. Guided by this principle, SDAMI adopts a two stage strategy: first, identify strong main effects that implicitly carry information about important interactions. second, exploit this information through structured regularization such as group lasso to distinguish genuine main effects from interaction effects. For each selected main effect, SDAMI constructs a dedicated subnetwork, enabling nonlinear function approximation while preserving interpretability and providing a structured foundation for modeling interactions. Extensive simulations with comparisons confirm SDAMI$'$s ability to recover effect structures across diverse scenarios, while applications in reliability analysis, neuroscience, and medical diagnostics further demonstrate its versatility in addressing real-world high-dimensional modeling challenges.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) effectively safeguards data privacy during model aggregation by encrypting local model updates before transmission, mitigating threats from untrusted servers or eavesdroppers in transmission. However, the computational burden and ciphertext expansion associated with homomorphic encryption can significantly increase resource and communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose FedBit, a hardware/software co-designed framework optimized for the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme. FedBit employs bit-interleaved data packing to embed multiple model parameters into a single ciphertext coefficient, thereby minimizing ciphertext expansion and maximizing computational parallelism. Additionally, we integrate a dedicated FPGA accelerator to handle cryptographic operations and an optimized dataflow to reduce the memory overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that FedBit achieves a speedup of two orders of magnitude in encryption and lowers average communication overhead by 60.7%, while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples. However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code is available at https://github.com/wentao228/SmiSelf.

Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.

Abstract: In WSN/IoT, node localization is essential to long-running applications for accurate environment monitoring and event detection, often covering a large area in the field. Due to the lower time resolution of typical WSN/IoT platforms (e.g., 1 microsecond on ESP32 platforms) and the jitters in timestamping, packet-level localization techniques cannot provide meter-level resolution. For high-precision localization as well as world-wide interoperability via 2.4-GHz ISM band, a new variant of LoRa, called LoRa 2.4 GHz, was proposed by semtech, which provides a radio frequency (RF) time of flight (ToF) ranging method for meter-level localization. However, the existing datasets reported in the literature are limited in their coverages and do not take into account varying environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. To address these issues, LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF ranging data was collected on a sports field at the XJTLU south campus, where three LoRa nodes logged samples of ranging with a LoRa base station, together with temperature and humidity, at reference points arranged as a 3x3 grid covering 400 square meter over three weeks and uploaded all measurement records to the base station equipped with an ESP32-based transceiver for machine and user communications. The results of a preliminary investigation based on a simple deep neural network (DNN) model demonstrate that the environmental factors, including the temperature and humidity, significantly affect the accuracy of ranging, which calls for advanced methods of compensating for the effects of environmental factors on LoRa RF ToF ranging outdoors.

Abstract: Gradient boosting is widely popular due to its flexibility and predictive accuracy. However, statistical inference and uncertainty quantification for gradient boosting remain challenging and under-explored. We propose a unified framework for statistical inference in gradient boosting regression. Our framework integrates dropout or parallel training with a recently proposed regularization procedure that allows for a central limit theorem (CLT) for boosting. With these enhancements, we surprisingly find that increasing the dropout rate and the number of trees grown in parallel at each iteration substantially enhances signal recovery and overall performance. Our resulting algorithms enjoy similar CLTs, which we use to construct built-in confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and rigorous hypothesis tests for assessing variable importance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms perform well, interpolate between regularized boosting and random forests, and confirm the validity of their built-in statistical inference procedures.

Abstract: Conditional risk minimization arises in high-stakes decisions where risk must be assessed in light of side information, such as stressed economic conditions, specific customer profiles, or other contextual covariates. Constructing reliable conditional distributions from limited data is notoriously difficult, motivating a series of optimal-transport-based proposals that address this uncertainty in a distributionally robust manner. Yet these approaches remain fragmented, each constrained by its own limitations: some rely on point estimates or restrictive structural assumptions, others apply only to narrow classes of risk measures, and their structural connections are unclear. We introduce a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk minimization, built on a novel union-ball formulation in optimal transport. This framework offers three key advantages: interpretability, by subsuming existing methods as special cases and revealing their deep structural links; tractability, by yielding convex reformulations for virtually all major risk functionals studied in the literature; and scalability, by supporting cutting-plane algorithms for large-scale conditional risk problems. Applications to portfolio optimization with rank-dependent expected utility highlight the practical effectiveness of the framework, with conditional models converging to optimal solutions where unconditional ones clearly do not.

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking) and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx 1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency. We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

<title>Tree Reward-Aligned Search for TReASURe in Masked Diffusion Language Models</title>

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges: (i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration, and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i) UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs (number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous scenarios.

<title>Grouped Satisficing Paths in Pure Strategy Games: a Topological Perspective</title>

Abstract: In game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), each agent selects a strategy, interacts with the environment and other agents, and subsequently updates its strategy based on the received payoff. This process generates a sequence of joint strategies $(s^t)_{t \geq 0}$, where $s^t$ represents the strategy profile of all agents at time step $t$. A widely adopted principle in MARL algorithms is "win-stay, lose-shift", which dictates that an agent retains its current strategy if it achieves the best response. This principle exhibits a fixed-point property when the joint strategy has become an equilibrium. The sequence of joint strategies under this principle is referred to as a satisficing path, a concept first introduced in [40] and explored in the context of $N$-player games in [39]. A fundamental question arises regarding this principle: Under what conditions does every initial joint strategy $s$ admit a finite-length satisficing path $(s^t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$ where $s^0=s$ and $s^T$ is an equilibrium? This paper establishes a sufficient condition for such a property, and demonstrates that any finite-state Markov game, as well as any $N$-player game, guarantees the existence of a finite-length satisficing path from an arbitrary initial strategy to some equilibrium. These results provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the design of MARL algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation. Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Abstract: Ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for studying speech articulation, motor control, and related disorders. However, real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We propose UltraUNet, a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture optimized for real-time segmentation of tongue contours in ultrasound images. UltraUNet incorporates domain-specific innovations such as lightweight Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, Group Normalization for small-batch stability, and summation-based skip connections to reduce memory and computational overhead. It achieves 250 frames per second and integrates ultrasound-specific augmentations like denoising and blur simulation. Evaluations on 8 datasets demonstrate high accuracy and robustness, with single-dataset Dice = 0.855 and MSD = 0.993px, and cross-dataset Dice averaging 0.734 and 0.761. UltraUNet provides a fast, accurate solution for speech research, clinical diagnostics, and analysis of speech motor disorders.

Abstract: We introduce a principled generative framework for graph signals that enables explicit control of feature heterophily, a key property underlying the effectiveness of graph learning methods. Our model combines a Lipschitz graphon-based random graph generator with Gaussian node features filtered through a smooth spectral function of the rescaled Laplacian. We establish new theoretical guarantees: (i) a concentration result for the empirical heterophily score; and (ii) almost-sure convergence of the feature heterophily measure to a deterministic functional of the graphon degree profile, based on a graphon-limit law for polynomial averages of Laplacian eigenvalues. These results elucidate how the interplay between the graphon and the filter governs the limiting level of feature heterophily, providing a tunable mechanism for data modeling and generation. We validate the theory through experiments demonstrating precise control of homophily across graph families and spectral filters.

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) suffer from high inter-subject variability and limited labeled data, often requiring lengthy calibration phases. In this work, we present an end-to-end approach that explicitly models the subject dependency using lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) conditioned on the subject's identity. Our method integrates hyperparameter optimization strategies that prioritize class imbalance and evaluates two conditioning mechanisms to adapt pre-trained models to unseen subjects with minimal calibration data. We benchmark three lightweight architectures on a time-modulated Event-Related Potentials (ERP) classification task, providing interpretable evaluation metrics and explainable visualizations of the learned representations. Results demonstrate improved generalization and data-efficient calibration, highlighting the scalability and practicality of subject-adaptive BCIs.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture, relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

<title>Scaling Policy Compliance Assessment in Language Models with Policy Reasoning Traces</title>

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Abstract: We investigate the recovery dynamics of healthy cardiac activity after physical exertion using multimodal biosignals recorded with a polycardiograph. Multifractal features derived from the singularity spectrum capture the scale-invariant properties of cardiovascular regulation. Five supervised classification algorithms - Logistic Regression (LogReg), Suport Vector Machine with RBF kernel (SVM-RBF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) - were evaluated to distinguish recovery states in a small, imbalanced dataset. Our results show that multifractal analysis, combined with multimodal sensing, yields reliable features for characterizing recovery and points toward nonlinear diagnostic methods for heart conditions.

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems that can operate in unstructured environments under extreme extraterrestrial conditions. The adoption of robot learning in this domain is severely hindered by the prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations and the limited availability of data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Space Robotics Bench, an open-source simulation framework for robot learning in space. It offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios. We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing policies capable of real-world operation. These contributions establish the Space Robotics Bench as a valuable resource for developing, benchmarking, and deploying the robust autonomous systems required for the final frontier.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become the de facto standard for modeling the human visual system, primarily due to their success in predicting neural responses. However, with many models now achieving similar predictive accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures. Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g., ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored. Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which (1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2) cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions, data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003 translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306 representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22 production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.

Abstract: Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder.

Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.

Abstract: Modeling complex multiway relationships in large-scale networks is becoming more and more challenging in data science. The multilinear PageRank problem, arising naturally in the study of higher-order Markov chains, is a powerful framework for capturing such interactions, with applications in web ranking, recommendation systems, and social network analysis. It extends the classical Google PageRank model to a tensor-based formulation, leading to a nonlinear system that captures multi-way dependencies between states. Newton-based methods can achieve local quadratic convergence for this problem, but they require solving a large linear system at each iteration, which becomes too costly for large-scale applications. To address this challenge, we present an accelerated Newton-GMRES method that leverages Krylov subspace techniques to approximate the Newton step without explicitly forming the large Jacobian matrix. We further employ vector extrapolation methods, including Minimal Polynomial Extrapolation (MPE), Reduced Rank Extrapolation (RRE), and Anderson Acceleration (AA), to improve the convergence rate and enhance numerical stability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms classical Newton-based solvers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup. Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with large models on a compute budget.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data. A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction, and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of a reservoir computer (RC) is generated at random, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on optimizing the topology of a linear RC to improve its performance and interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both the training and testing phases and also often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based automated scoring.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure. We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis, knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia, ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of a drug with favorable predicted properties. The open-source ToolUniverse is available at https://aiscientist.tools.

Abstract: Preconditioning (scaling) is essential in many areas of mathematics, and in particular in optimization. In this work, we study the problem of finding an optimal diagonal preconditioner. We focus on minimizing two different notions of condition number: the classical, worst-case type, $\kappa$-condition number, and the more averaging motivated $\omega$-condition number. We provide affine based pseudoconvex reformulations of both optimization problems. The advantage of our formulations is that the gradient of the objective is inexpensive to compute and the optimization variable is just an $n\times 1$ vector. We also provide elegant characterizations of the optimality conditions of both problems.
  We develop a competitive subgradient method, with convergence guarantees, for $\kappa$-optimal diagonal preconditioning that scales much better and is more efficient than existing SDP-based approaches. We also show that the preconditioners found by our subgradient method leads to better PCG performance for solving linear systems than other approaches. Finally, we show the interesting phenomenon that we can apply the $\omega$-optimal preconditioner to the exact $\kappa$-optimally diagonally preconditioned matrix $A$ and get consistent, significantly improved convergence results for PCG methods.

<title>S$^3$F-Net: A Multi-Modal Approach to Medical Image Classification via Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network</title>

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Biomedical audio signals, such as phonocardiograms (PCG), are inherently rhythmic and contain diagnostic information in both their spectral (tonal) and temporal domains. Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact, estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism. From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses, guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between modalities.

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions. In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and criminal justice.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition, and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision, question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event-driven computation suited to time-critical networking tasks such as anomaly detection, local routing control, and congestion management at the edge. Classical units, including Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for resource constrained deployments.

<title>On the Shelf Life of Fine-Tuned LLM Judges: Future Proofing, Backward Compatibility, and Question Generalization</title>

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently, finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones, showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

Abstract: Many modern applications involve predicting structured, non-Euclidean outputs such as probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite matrices. These outputs are naturally modeled as elements of general metric spaces, where classical regression techniques that rely on vector space structure no longer apply. We introduce E2M (End-to-End Metric regression), a deep learning framework for predicting metric space-valued outputs. E2M performs prediction via a weighted Fr\'echet means over training outputs, where the weights are learned by a neural network conditioned on the input. This construction provides a principled mechanism for geometry-aware prediction that avoids surrogate embeddings and restrictive parametric assumptions, while fully preserving the intrinsic geometry of the output space. We establish theoretical guarantees, including a universal approximation theorem that characterizes the expressive capacity of the model and a convergence analysis of the entropy-regularized training objective. Through extensive simulations involving probability distributions, networks, and symmetric positive-definite matrices, we show that E2M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with its advantages becoming more pronounced at larger sample sizes. Applications to human mortality distributions and New York City taxi networks further demonstrate the flexibility and practical utility of the framework.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large, unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based, behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes. Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot in outdoor field tests.

Abstract: Considering higher-order interactions allows for a more comprehensive understanding of network structures beyond simple pairwise connections. While leveraging all cliques in a network to handle higher-order interactions is intuitive, it often leads to computational inefficiencies due to overlapping information between higher-order and lower-order cliques. To address this issue, we propose an augmented maximal clique strategy. Although using only maximal cliques can reduce unnecessary overlap and provide a concise representation of the network, certain nodes may still appear in multiple maximal cliques, resulting in imbalanced training data. Therefore, our augmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques to mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced learning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and real-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches based on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques. Finally, by integrating this strategy into GNN-based semi-supervised learning, we establish a link between maximal clique-based methods and GNNs, showing that incorporating higher-order structures improves predictive accuracy. As a result, the augmented maximal clique strategy offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for higher-order network learning.

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

Abstract: We leverage the capacity of large language models such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in constructing factor models for Chinese futures markets. We successfully obtain 40 factors to design single-factor and multi-factor portfolios through long-short and long-only strategies, conducting backtests during the in-sample and out-of-sample period. Comprehensive empirical analysis reveals that GPT-generated factors deliver remarkable Sharpe ratios and annualized returns while maintaining acceptable maximum drawdowns. Notably, the GPT-based factor models also achieve significant alphas over the IPCA benchmark. Moreover, these factors demonstrate significant performance across extensive robustness tests, particularly excelling after the cutoff date of GPT's training data.

Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for ultrafast and energy-efficient computation. These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.

<title>Communication-aware Wide-Area Damping Control using Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control (WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or {cyber perturbations}. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify SGDmax's convergence and VSCs' damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays, our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication issues and cyber perturbations.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training, where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and remask them. This alternating ($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$) process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

<title>LightFair: Towards an Efficient Alternative for Fair T2I Diffusion via Debiasing Pre-trained Text Encoders</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23639</link>

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

<title>Confidence Aware SSD Ensemble with Weighted Boxes Fusion for Weapon Detection</title>

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced, they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy. Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving accuracy metrics of ensembles.

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However, the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation on the ShapeNet dataset.

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) on Romanian driving-law QA with explanation generation. We release a 1{,}208-question dataset (387 multimodal) and compare text-only and multimodal SOTA systems, then measure the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning for Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct. SOTA models perform well, but fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform direct visual input. Finally, an LLM-as-a-Judge assesses explanation quality, revealing self-preference bias. The study informs explainable QA for less-resourced languages.

Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Abstract: While automatic music transcription is well-established in music information retrieval, most models are limited to transcribing pitch and timing information from audio, and thus omit crucial expressive and instrument-specific nuances. One example is playing technique on the violin, which affords its distinct palette of timbres for maximal emotional impact. Here, we propose \textbf{VioPTT} (Violin Playing Technique-aware Transcription), a lightweight, end-to-end model that directly transcribes violin playing technique in addition to pitch onset and offset. Furthermore, we release \textbf{MOSA-VPT}, a novel, high-quality synthetic violin playing technique dataset to circumvent the need for manually labeled annotations. Leveraging this dataset, our model demonstrated strong generalization to real-world note-level violin technique recordings in addition to achieving state-of-the-art transcription performance. To our knowledge, VioPTT is the first to jointly combine violin transcription and playing technique prediction within a unified framework.

Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries, exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making. Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in complex maps like warehouses.

Abstract: Modern generative AI models such as diffusion and flow matching can sample from rich data distributions, but many downstream tasks -- such as experimental design or creative content generation -- require a higher level of control than unconstrained sampling. The challenge is to efficiently identify outputs that are both probable under the model and satisfy task-specific constraints. We address this by introducing surrogate latent spaces: non-parametric, low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings that can be extracted from any generative model without additional training. The axes in the Euclidean space can be defined via examples, providing a simple and interpretable approach to define custom latent spaces that both express intended features and are convenient to use in downstream tasks. The representation is Euclidean and has controllable dimensionality, permitting direct application of standard optimisation algorithms to traverse the outputs of generative models. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, incurs almost no additional computational cost, and generalises across modalities, including images, audio, videos, and structured objects like proteins.

Abstract: Concolic testing for deep neural networks alternates concrete execution with constraint solving to search for inputs that flip decisions. We present an {influence-guided} concolic tester for Transformer classifiers that ranks path predicates by SHAP-based estimates of their impact on the model output. To enable SMT solving on modern architectures, we prototype a solver-compatible, pure-Python semantics for multi-head self-attention and introduce practical scheduling heuristics that temper constraint growth on deeper models. In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks. These observations suggest that (i) influence signals provide a useful search bias for symbolic exploration, and (ii) solver-friendly attention semantics paired with lightweight scheduling make concolic testing feasible for contemporary Transformer models, offering potential utility for debugging and model auditing.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\eg, backdoor detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process, even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method (\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures, and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously overlooked vulnerability in the KD process. Our code is available at https://github.com/WhitolfChen/SCAR.

Abstract: Context: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed in critical applications, where resilience against adversarial inputs is paramount. However, whether coverage-based or confidence-based, existing test prioritization methods often fail to efficiently identify the most fault-revealing inputs, limiting their practical effectiveness. Aims: This project aims to enhance fault detection and model robustness in DNNs by integrating Learning-Based Testing (LBT) with hypothesis and mutation testing to efficiently prioritize adversarial test cases. Methods: Our method selects a subset of adversarial inputs with a high likelihood of exposing model faults, without relying on architecture-specific characteristics or formal verification, making it adaptable across diverse DNNs. Results: Our results demonstrate that the proposed LBT method consistently surpasses baseline approaches in prioritizing fault-revealing inputs and accelerating fault detection. By efficiently organizing test permutations, it uncovers all potential faults significantly faster across various datasets, model architectures, and adversarial attack techniques. Conclusion: Beyond improving fault detection, our method preserves input diversity and provides effective guidance for model retraining, further enhancing robustness. These advantages establish our approach as a powerful and practical solution for adversarial test prioritization in real-world DNN applications.

<title>Equation-Free Coarse Control of Distributed Parameter Systems via Local Neural Operators</title>

Abstract: The control of high-dimensional distributed parameter systems (DPS) remains a challenge when explicit coarse-grained equations are unavailable. Classical equation-free (EF) approaches rely on fine-scale simulators treated as black-box timesteppers. However, repeated simulations for steady-state computation, linearization, and control design are often computationally prohibitive, or the microscopic timestepper may not even be available, leaving us with data as the only resource. We propose a data-driven alternative that uses local neural operators, trained on spatiotemporal microscopic/mesoscopic data, to obtain efficient short-time solution operators. These surrogates are employed within Krylov subspace methods to compute coarse steady and unsteady-states, while also providing Jacobian information in a matrix-free manner. Krylov-Arnoldi iterations then approximate the dominant eigenspectrum, yielding reduced models that capture the open-loop slow dynamics without explicit Jacobian assembly. Both discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator (dLQR) and pole-placement (PP) controllers are based on this reduced system and lifted back to the full nonlinear dynamics, thereby closing the feedback loop.

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models (LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records. TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage, particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary angiography.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV) caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost. Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks, but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence, thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm.

Abstract: The advent of transformers has in recent years led to powerful and revolutionary Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this, our understanding on the capability of transformers is still meager. In this invited contribution, we recount the rapid progress in the last few years to the question of what transformers can do. In particular, we will see the integral role of logic and automata (also with some help from circuit complexity) in answering this question. We also mention several open problems at the intersection of logic, automata, verification and transformers.

Abstract: Conformal prediction can be used to construct prediction sets that cover the true outcome with a desired probability, but can sometimes lead to large prediction sets that are costly in practice. The most useful outcome is a singleton prediction-an unambiguous decision-yet existing efficiency-oriented methods primarily optimize average set size. Motivated by this, we propose a new nonconformity score that aims to minimize the probability of producing non-singleton sets. Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency (sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on average set size.

<title>GEAR: A General Evaluation Framework for Abductive Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics: consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability (consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way, GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000 candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives. Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with finite-sample conditional guarantees. We build upon the RKHS-based framework of Gibbs et al. (2023), which leverages families of covariate shifts to provide approximate conditional conformal prediction intervals, an approach with strong theoretical promise, but with prohibitive computational cost. To bridge this gap, we develop a stable and efficient algorithm that computes the full solution path of the regularized RKHS conformal optimization problem, at essentially the same cost as a single kernel quantile fit. Our path-tracing framework simultaneously tunes hyperparameters, providing smoothness control and data-adaptive calibration. To extend the method to high-dimensional settings, we further integrate our approach with low-rank latent embeddings that capture conditional validity in a data-driven latent space. Empirically, our method provides reliable conditional coverage across a variety of modern black-box predictors, improving the interval length of Gibbs et al. (2023) by 30%, while achieving a 40-fold speedup.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and (iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES, WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25, GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment. We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures. Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging initial conditions.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at $411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability, we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.

Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

Abstract: The early and accurate classification of brain tumors is crucial for guiding effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study presents BrainFusion, a significant advancement in brain tumor analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by combining fine-tuned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tumor classification--including VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception--with YOLOv8 for precise tumor localization with bounding boxes. Leveraging the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, our experiments reveal that the fine-tuned VGG16 model achieves test accuracy of 99.86%, substantially exceeding previous benchmarks. Beyond setting a new accuracy standard, the integration of bounding-box localization and explainable AI techniques further enhances both the clinical interpretability and trustworthiness of the system's outputs. Overall, this approach underscores the transformative potential of deep learning in delivering faster, more reliable diagnoses, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and survival rates.

Abstract: Accurately measuring portfolio similarity is critical for a wide range of financial applications, including Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) recommendation, portfolio trading, and risk alignment. Existing similarity measures often rely on exact asset overlap or static distance metrics, which fail to capture similarities among the constituents (e.g., securities within the portfolio) as well as nuanced relationships between partially overlapping portfolios with heterogeneous weights. We introduce STRAPSim (Semantic, Two-level, Residual-Aware Portfolio Similarity), a novel method that computes portfolio similarity by matching constituents based on semantic similarity, weighting them according to their portfolio share, and aggregating results via residual-aware greedy alignment. We benchmark our approach against Jaccard, weighted Jaccard, as well as BERTScore-inspired variants across public classification, regression, and recommendation tasks, as well as on corporate bond ETF datasets. Empirical results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in predictive accuracy and ranking alignment, achieving the highest Spearman correlation with return-based similarity. By leveraging constituent-aware matching and dynamic reweighting, portfolio similarity offers a scalable, interpretable framework for comparing structured asset baskets, demonstrating its utility in ETF benchmarking, portfolio construction, and systematic execution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation, but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs, (ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii) contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning. Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published at https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher and https://huggingface.co/AceSearcher.

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of 117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks) for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations) for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68 variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of 56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL) often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.

<title>Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.

Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in men and the eighth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has become central to the diagnostic pathway for men at intermediate risk, improving de-tection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) while reducing unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis. However, mpMRI remains limited by false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver agreement. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) MRI, a novel sequence that enables tissue microstructure characterization, has shown encouraging preclinical performance in distinguishing clinically significant from insignificant PCa. Combining TDD-derived metrics with machine learning may provide robust, zone-specific risk prediction with less dependence on reader training and improved accuracy compared to current standard-of-care. This study protocol out-lines the rationale and describes the prospective evaluation of a home-developed AI-enhanced TDD-MRI software (PROSTDAI) in routine diagnostic care, assessing its added value against PI-RADS v2.1 and validating results against MRI-guided prostate biopsy.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90 percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline mitigation strategies.

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from 2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) continue to gain popularity, head and hand motion data captured by consumer VR systems have become ubiquitous. Prior work shows that such telemetry can be highly identifying and reflect broad user traits, often aligning with intuitive "folk theories" of body language. However, it remains unclear to what extent motion kinematics encode more nuanced cognitive states, such as confusion, hesitation, and readiness, which lack clear correlates with motion. To investigate this, we introduce a novel dataset of head and hand motion with frame-level annotations of these states collected during structured decision-making tasks. Our findings suggest that deep temporal models can infer subtle cognitive states from motion alone, achieving comparable performance with human observers. This work demonstrates that standard VR telemetry contains strong patterns related to users' internal cognitive processes, which opens the door for a new generation of adaptive virtual environments. To enhance reproducibility and support future work, we will make our dataset and modeling framework publicly available.

Abstract: Decentralized inference is an appealing paradigm for serving large language models (LLMs), offering strong security, high efficiency, and lower operating costs. Yet the permissionless setting admits no a priori trust in participating nodes, making output verifiability a prerequisite for secure deployment. We present VeriLLM, a publicly verifiable protocol for decentralized LLM inference that (i) achieves security under a one-honest-verifier assumption, (ii) attains near-negligible verification cost (about 1% of the underlying inference) via a lightweight verification algorithm designed explicitly for LLMs, and (iii) enforces honest checking through a peer-prediction mechanism that mitigates lazy verification in naive voting. We further introduce an isomorphic inference-verification network that multiplexes both roles on the same set of GPU workers. This architecture (i) increases GPU utilization and thereby improves end-to-end throughput for both inference and verification, (ii) expands the effective pool of available validators, strengthening robustness and security, and (iii) enforces task indistinguishability at the worker boundary to prevent job-type-conditioned behavior. Finally, we provide a formal game-theoretic analysis and prove that, under our incentives, honest inference and verification constitute a Nash equilibrium, ensuring incentive compatibility against rational adversaries. To our knowledge, this is the first decentralized inference verification protocol with an end-to-end game-theoretic security proof.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm, Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Identifying DNA- (DBPs) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is crucial for the understanding of cell function, molecular interactions as well as regulatory functions. Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label. The original datasets are available at http://bliulab.net/iDRBP\_MMC and the codes are available at https://github.com/NimishaGhosh/LAMP-PRo.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for efficiently predicting the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids with free surface dynamics. The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions. Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult. The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and droplet impact simulations. The results underscore the potential of GNN-based simulation frameworks for efficiently modeling non-Newtonian fluid behavior, paving the way for future advancements in data-driven fluid simulations.

<title>Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds</title>

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction. However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Abstract: Estimating causal quantities (CQs) typically requires large datasets, which can be expensive to obtain, especially when measuring individual outcomes is costly. This challenge highlights the importance of sample-efficient active learning strategies. To address the narrow focus of prior work on the conditional average treatment effect, we formalize the broader task of Actively estimating Causal Quantities (ActiveCQ) and propose a unified framework for this general problem. Built upon the insight that many CQs are integrals of regression functions, our framework models the regression function with a Gaussian Process. For the distribution component, we explore both a baseline using explicit density estimators and a more integrated method using conditional mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This latter approach offers key advantages: it bypasses explicit density estimation, operates within the same function space as the GP, and adaptively refines the distributional model after each update. Our framework enables the principled derivation of acquisition strategies from the CQ's posterior uncertainty; we instantiate this principle with two utility functions based on information gain and total variance reduction. A range of simulated and semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate that our principled framework significantly outperforms relevant baselines, achieving substantial gains in sample efficiency across a variety of CQs.

Abstract: Representation learning is a key technique in modern machine learning that enables models to identify meaningful patterns in complex data. However, different methods tend to extract distinct aspects of the data, and relying on a single approach may overlook important insights relevant to downstream tasks. This paper proposes a performance-enhanced aggregated representation learning method, which combines multiple representation learning approaches to improve the performance of downstream tasks. The framework is designed to be general and flexible, accommodating a wide range of loss functions commonly used in machine learning models. To ensure computational efficiency, we use surrogate loss functions to facilitate practical weight estimation. Theoretically, we prove that our method asymptotically achieves optimal performance in downstream tasks, meaning that the risk of our predictor is asymptotically equivalent to the theoretical minimum. Additionally, we derive that our method asymptotically assigns nonzero weights to correctly specified models. We evaluate our method on diverse tasks by comparing it with advanced machine learning models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods, showing its effectiveness and broad applicability in real-world machine learning scenarios.

Abstract: We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about $2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.

<title>Hyperspherical Latents Improve Continuous-Token Autoregressive Generation</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG), and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG -- to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models, achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54 and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge, this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter scales.

<title>DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify \emph{gradient consensus}--the tendency of randomized transformations to yield aligned gradients--as a key driver of adversarial transferability. Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial defense.

Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting, in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors, communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics, suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered compression methods.

Abstract: This project presents an AI-based system for tone replication in music production, focusing on predicting EQ parameter settings directly from audio features. Unlike traditional audio-to-audio methods, our approach outputs interpretable parameter values (e.g., EQ band gains) that musicians can further adjust in their workflow. Using a dataset of piano recordings with systematically varied EQ settings, we evaluate both regression and neural network models. The neural network achieves a mean squared error of 0.0216 on multi-band tasks. The system enables practical, flexible, and automated tone matching for music producers and lays the foundation for extensions to more complex audio effects.

<title>FuncPoison: Poisoning Function Library to Hijack Multi-agent Autonomous Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on multi-agent architectures powered by large language models (LLMs), where specialized agents collaborate to perceive, reason, and plan. A key component of these systems is the shared function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms. Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.

Abstract: The inherent instability and noise in user interaction data challenge sequential recommendation systems. Prevailing masked attention models, relying on a single query from the most recent item, are sensitive to this noise, reducing prediction reliability. We propose the Multi-Item-Query attention mechanism (MIQ-Attn) to enhance model stability and accuracy. MIQ-Attn constructs multiple diverse query vectors from user interactions, effectively mitigating noise and improving consistency. It is designed for easy adoption as a drop-in replacement for existing single-query attention. Experiments show MIQ-Attn significantly improves performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Internet service providers monitor their networks to detect, triage, and remediate service impairments. When an incident is detected, it is important to determine whether similar incidents have occurred in the past or are happening concurrently elsewhere in the network. Manual correlation of such incidents is infeasible due to the scale of the networks under observation, making automated correlation a necessity. This paper presents a self-supervised learning method for similarity-based correlation of network situations. Using this method, a deep neural network is trained on a large unlabeled dataset of network situations using contrastive learning. High precision achieved in experiments on real-world network monitoring data suggests that contrastive learning is a promising approach to network incident correlation.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards, adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses. Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering, which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues. This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints, and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Preference-based data often appear complex and noisy but may conceal underlying homogeneous structures. This paper introduces a novel framework of ranking structure recognition for preference-based data. We first develop an approach to identify dynamic ranking groups by incorporating temporal penalties into a spectral estimation for the celebrated Bradley-Terry model. To detect structural changes, we introduce an innovative objective function and present a practicable algorithm based on dynamic programming. Theoretically, we establish the consistency of ranking group recognition by exploiting properties of a random `design matrix' induced by a reversible Markov chain. We also tailor a group inverse technique to quantify the uncertainty in item ability estimates. Additionally, we prove the consistency of structure change recognition, ensuring the robustness of the proposed framework. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the practical utility and interpretability of our approach.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks (D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable, adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub repository.

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the (diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training) for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning. Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient, and general framework for training flow map models.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents. However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantitative convergence of shallow neural networks trained via gradient descent to their associated Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit.
  While previous work has established qualitative convergence under broad settings, precise, finite-width estimates remain limited, particularly during training.
  We provide explicit upper bounds on the quadratic Wasserstein distance between the network output and its Gaussian approximation at any training time $t \ge 0$, demonstrating polynomial decay with network width.
  Our results quantify how architectural parameters, such as width and input dimension, influence convergence, and how training dynamics affect the approximation error.

Abstract: This thesis studies the exploration and exploitation trade-off in online learning of properties of quantum states using multi-armed bandits. Given streaming access to an unknown quantum state, in each round we select an observable from a set of actions to maximize its expectation value. Using past information, we refine actions to minimize regret; the cumulative gap between current reward and the maximum possible. We derive information-theoretic lower bounds and optimal strategies with matching upper bounds, showing regret typically scales as the square root of rounds. As an application, we reframe quantum state tomography to both learn the state efficiently and minimize measurement disturbance. For pure states and continuous actions, we achieve polylogarithmic regret using a sample-optimal algorithm based on a weighted online least squares estimator. The algorithm relies on the optimistic principle and controls the eigenvalues of the design matrix. We also apply our framework to quantum recommender systems and thermodynamic work extraction from unknown states. In this last setting, our results demonstrate an exponential advantage in work dissipation over tomography-based protocols.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

Abstract: We describe algorithms and data structures to extend a neural network library with automatic precision estimation for floating point computations. We also discuss conditions to make estimations exact and preserve high computation performance of neural networks training and inference. Numerical experiments show the consequences of significant precision loss for particular values such as inference, gradients and deviations from mathematically predicted behavior.
  It turns out that almost any neural network accumulates computational inaccuracies. As a result, its behavior does not coincide with predicted by the mathematical model of neural network. This shows that tracking of computational inaccuracies is important for reliability of inference, training and interpretability of results.

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a natural language processing task.

<title>InfLLM-V2: Dense-Sparse Switchable Attention for Seamless Short-to-Long Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long} workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2 reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2 that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and 99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1 (https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model, providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

<title>Reference-Free Rating of LLM Responses via Latent Information</title>

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references, and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and (iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a highly effective method for generating samples from a distribution of images. We consider scenarios where the training data comes from a noisy version of the target distribution, and present an efficiently implementable modification of the inference procedure to generate noiseless samples. Our approach is motivated by the manifold hypothesis, according to which meaningful data is concentrated around some low-dimensional manifold of a high-dimensional ambient space. The central idea is that noise manifests as low magnitude variation in off-manifold directions in contrast to the relevant variation of the desired distribution which is mostly confined to on-manifold directions. We introduce the notion of an extended score and show that, in a simplified setting, it can be used to reduce small variations to zero, while leaving large variations mostly unchanged. We describe how its approximation can be computed efficiently from an approximation to the standard score and demonstrate its efficacy on toy problems, synthetic data, and real data.

Abstract: This paper presents Bundle Network, a learning-based algorithm inspired by the Bundle Method for convex non-smooth minimization problems. Unlike classical approaches that rely on heuristic tuning of a regularization parameter, our method automatically learns to adjust it from data. Furthermore, we replace the iterative resolution of the optimization problem that provides the search direction-traditionally computed as a convex combination of gradients at visited points-with a recurrent neural model equipped with an attention mechanism. By leveraging the unrolled graph of computation, our Bundle Network can be trained end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Experiments on Lagrangian dual relaxations of the Multi-Commodity Network Design and Generalized Assignment problems demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms traditional methods relying on grid search for parameter tuning, while generalizing effectively across datasets.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy, and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG) framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics. To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more generalizable and robust neural representations.

Abstract: Audio pretrained models are widely employed to solve various tasks in speech processing, sound event detection, or music information retrieval. However, the representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems. Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes, establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors encoded in the representations.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine, Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%. These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next, we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs, the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

Abstract: When solving PDEs, classical numerical solvers are often computationally expensive, while machine learning methods can suffer from spectral bias, failing to capture high-frequency components. Designing an optimal hybrid iterative solver--where, at each iteration, a solver is selected from an ensemble of solvers to leverage their complementary strengths--poses a challenging combinatorial problem. While the greedy selection strategy is desirable for its constant-factor approximation guarantee to the optimal solution, it requires knowledge of the true error at each step, which is generally unavailable in practice. We address this by proposing an approximate greedy router that efficiently mimics a greedy approach to solver selection. Empirical results on the Poisson and Helmholtz equations demonstrate that our method outperforms single-solver baselines and existing hybrid solver approaches, such as HINTS, achieving faster and more stable convergence.

Abstract: Sparse embeddings of data form an attractive class due to their inherent interpretability: Every dimension is tied to a term in some vocabulary, making it easy to visually decipher the latent space. Sparsity, however, poses unique challenges for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) which finds, from a collection of vectors, the k vectors closest to a query. To encourage research on this underexplored topic, sparse ANNS featured prominently in a BigANN Challenge at NeurIPS 2023, where approximate algorithms were evaluated on large benchmark datasets by throughput and accuracy. In this work, we introduce a set of novel data structures and algorithmic methods, a combination of which leads to an elegant, effective, and highly efficient solution to sparse ANNS. Our contributions range from a theoretically-grounded sketching algorithm for sparse vectors to reduce their effective dimensionality while preserving inner product-induced ranks; a geometric organization of the inverted index; and the blending of local and global information to improve the efficiency and efficacy of ANNS. Empirically, our final algorithm, dubbed Seismic, reaches sub-millisecond per-query latency with high accuracy on a large-scale benchmark dataset using a single CPU.

Abstract: We propose a high-payload image watermarking method for textual embedding, where a semantic description of the image - which may also correspond to the input text prompt-, is embedded inside the image. In order to be able to robustly embed high payloads in large-scale images - such as those produced by modern AI generators - the proposed approach builds upon a traditional watermarking scheme that exploits orthogonal and turbo codes for improved robustness, and integrates frequency-domain embedding and perceptual masking techniques to enhance watermark imperceptibility. Experiments show that the proposed method is extremely robust against a wide variety of image processing, and the embedded text can be retrieved also after traditional and AI inpainting, permitting to unveil the semantic modification the image has undergone via image-text mismatch analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

Although not straightforward, their recent application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals: a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge, the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different mediums.

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied, attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation pipelines.

<title>Improved Stochastic Optimization of LogSumExp</title>

Abstract: The LogSumExp function, also known as the free energy, plays a central role in many important optimization problems, including entropy-regularized optimal transport and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). It is also the dual to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is widely used in machine learning. In practice, when the number of exponential terms inside the logarithm is large or infinite, optimization becomes challenging since computing the gradient requires differentiating every term. Previous approaches that replace the full sum with a small batch introduce significant bias. We propose a novel approximation to LogSumExp that can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. This approximation is rooted in a sound modification of the KL divergence in the dual, resulting in a new $f$-divergence called the safe KL divergence. The accuracy of the approximation is controlled by a tunable parameter and can be made arbitrarily small. Like the LogSumExp, our approximation preserves convexity. Moreover, when applied to an $L$-smooth function bounded from below, the smoothness constant of the resulting objective scales linearly with $L$. Experiments in DRO and continuous optimal transport demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines and the effective treatment of numerical issues associated with the standard LogSumExp and KL.

Abstract: Although probing frozen models has become a standard evaluation paradigm, self-supervised learning in audio defaults to fine-tuning. A key reason is that global pooling creates an information bottleneck causing linear probes to misrepresent the embedding quality: The $\texttt{cls}$-token discards crucial token information about dispersed, localized events in multi-label audio. This weakness is rooted in the mismatch between the pretraining objective (operating globally) and the downstream task (localized events). Across a comprehensive benchmark of 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, we first investigate the global pooling bottleneck. We then introduce binarized prototypical probes: a lightweight and simple pooling method that learns prototypes to perform class-wise information aggregation. Despite its simplicity, our method notably outperforms linear and attentive probing. Our work establishes probing as a competitive and efficient paradigm for evaluating audio SSL models, challenging the reliance on costly fine-tuning.

<title>When Scores Learn Geometry: Rate Separations under the Manifold Hypothesis</title>

Abstract: Score-based methods, such as diffusion models and Bayesian inverse problems, are often interpreted as learning the data distribution in the low-noise limit ($\sigma \to 0$). In this work, we propose an alternative perspective: their success arises from implicitly learning the data manifold rather than the full distribution. Our claim is based on a novel analysis of scores in the small-$\sigma$ regime that reveals a sharp separation of scales: information about the data manifold is $\Theta(\sigma^{-2})$ stronger than information about the distribution. We argue that this insight suggests a paradigm shift from the less practical goal of distributional learning to the more attainable task of geometric learning, which provably tolerates $O(\sigma^{-2})$ larger errors in score approximation. We illustrate this perspective through three consequences: i) in diffusion models, concentration on data support can be achieved with a score error of $o(\sigma^{-2})$, whereas recovering the specific data distribution requires a much stricter $o(1)$ error; ii) more surprisingly, learning the uniform distribution on the manifold-an especially structured and useful object-is also $O(\sigma^{-2})$ easier; and iii) in Bayesian inverse problems, the maximum entropy prior is $O(\sigma^{-2})$ more robust to score errors than generic priors. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with preliminary experiments on large-scale models, including Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: We study empirical risk minimization in a single-head tied-attention layer trained on synthetic high-dimensional sequence tasks, given by the recently introduced attention-indexed model. Using tools from random matrix theory, spin-glass physics, and approximate message passing, we derive sharp asymptotics for training and test errors, locate interpolation and recovery thresholds, and characterize the limiting spectral distribution of the learned weights. Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form. Remarkably, the predicted spectral distribution echoes empirical trends reported in large-scale transformers, offering a theoretical perspective consistent with these phenomena.

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation often suffers from limited generalization and data scarcity, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level planning and low-level control.

Abstract: The geometry of dynamical systems estimated from trajectory data is a major challenge for machine learning applications. Koopman and transfer operators provide a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics through their spectral decomposition, offering a natural framework for comparison. We propose a novel approach representing each system as a distribution of its joint operator eigenvalues and spectral projectors and defining a metric between systems leveraging optimal transport. The proposed metric is invariant to the sampling frequency of trajectories. It is also computationally efficient, supported by finite-sample convergence guarantees, and enables the computation of Fr\'echet means, providing interpolation between dynamical systems. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms standard operator-based distances in machine learning applications, including dimensionality reduction and classification, and provides meaningful interpolation between dynamical systems.

Abstract: We introduce Fed-Span, a novel federated/distributed learning framework designed for low Earth orbit satellite constellations. By leveraging graph-theoretic principles, Fed-Span addresses critical challenges inherent to distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites, and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span builds upon minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies, enabling spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive novel convergence bounds for non-convex machine learning loss functions, accommodating the key system characteristics and degrees of freedom of Fed-Span. Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span. We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods, with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency. These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed learning in satellite networks.

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models: training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work, we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89 percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at https://msg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: We present a bio-hybrid environmental sensor system that integrates natural plants and embedded deep learning for real-time, on-device detection of temperature and ozone level changes. Our system, based on the low-power PhytoNode platform, records electric differential potential signals from Hedera helix and processes them onboard using an embedded deep learning model. We demonstrate that our sensing device detects changes in temperature and ozone with good sensitivity of up to 0.98. Daily and inter-plant variability, as well as limited precision, could be mitigated by incorporating additional training data, which is readily integrable in our data-driven framework. Our approach also has potential to scale to new environmental factors and plant species. By integrating embedded deep learning onboard our biological sensing device, we offer a new, low-power solution for continuous environmental monitoring and potentially other fields of application.

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward pass.

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with limited understanding of their internal representations. Current interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing noisy, expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. When the objective exhibits invariances under a group action, exploiting these symmetries can substantially improve BO efficiency. While using maximum similarity across group orbits has long been considered in other domains, the fact that the max kernel is not positive semidefinite (PSD) has prevented its use in BO. In this work, we revisit this idea by considering a PSD projection of the max kernel. Compared to existing invariant (and non-invariant) kernels, we show it achieves significantly lower regret on both synthetic and real-world BO benchmarks, without increasing computational complexity.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito, ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e., Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving technologies have introduced a paradigm shift that allows for realizable secure computing in real-world systems. The significant barrier to the practical adoption of these primitives is the computational and communication overhead that is incurred when applied at scale. In this paper, we present an overview of our efforts to bridge the gap between this overhead and practicality for privacy-preserving learning systems using multi-party computation (MPC), zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Through meticulous hardware/software/algorithm co-design, we show progress towards enabling LLM-scale applications in privacy-preserving settings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions in several contexts, including DNN IP ownership, ethical LLM usage enforcement, and transformer inference.

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using 12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets. Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB, dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training, stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second, we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels. Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust, distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of expert actions or onboard measurements.

Abstract: We study spectral learning for orthogonally decomposable (odeco) tensors, emphasizing the interplay between statistical limits, optimization geometry, and initialization. Unlike matrices, recovery for odeco tensors does not hinge on eigengaps, yielding improved robustness under noise. While iterative methods such as tensor power iterations can be statistically efficient, initialization emerges as the main computational bottleneck. We investigate perturbation bounds, non-convex optimization analysis, and initialization strategies, clarifying when efficient algorithms attain statistical limits and when fundamental barriers remain.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly available.

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users' natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable, effective supervision for personalized alignment.

<title>Paired by the Teacher: Turning Unpaired Data into High-Fidelity Pairs for Low-Resource Text Generation</title>

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios, practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions, or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs, yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization (SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style, highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and 440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation, semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform), across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments (indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors (resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at 25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

<title>Pretraining Large Language Models with NVFP4</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size, training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However, quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence, and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM training algorithms.

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has driven demand for long context inference on resource constrained edge devices. However, deploying these models on Neural Processing Units (NPUs) presents significant challenges due to the architectural mismatch: quadratic complexity of standard attention mechanisms conflicts with memory and compute patterns of edge accelerators. This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of various causal inference operators on a modern NPU. We benchmark standard quadratic attention against several sub-quadratic alternatives, including structured state-space and linear attention models. Our analysis reveals that while sub-quadratic methods offer superior scalability, they introduce distinct computational bottlenecks on the NPU's specialized execution units. We identify that quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound, suffering from cache inefficiency and pipeline stalls exceeding 95% at long contexts. In contrast, sub-quadratic models can become compute-bound on programmable vector cores. These findings provide critical insights for the co-design of hardware-aware models and optimization strategies to enable on-device AI inference with long-contexts.

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i) surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and generation.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: In a recent series of papers it has been established that variants of Gradient Descent/Ascent and Mirror Descent exhibit last iterate convergence in convex-concave zero-sum games. Specifically, \cite{DISZ17, LiangS18} show last iterate convergence of the so called "Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent" for the case of \textit{unconstrained} min-max optimization. Moreover, in \cite{Metal} the authors show that Mirror Descent with an extra gradient step displays last iterate convergence for convex-concave problems (both constrained and unconstrained), though their algorithm does not follow the online learning framework; it uses extra information rather than \textit{only} the history to compute the next iteration. In this work, we show that "Optimistic Multiplicative-Weights Update (OMWU)" which follows the no-regret online learning framework, exhibits last iterate convergence locally for convex-concave games, generalizing the results of \cite{DP19} where last iterate convergence of OMWU was shown only for the \textit{bilinear case}. We complement our results with experiments that indicate fast convergence of the method.

Abstract: Salient Object Detection (SOD) plays a crucial role in many computer vision applications, requiring accurate localization and precise boundary delineation of salient regions. In this work, we present a novel framework that integrates multi-scale context aggregation, advanced attention mechanisms, and an uncertainty-aware module for improved SOD performance. Our Adaptive Cross-Scale Context Module effectively fuses features from multiple levels, leveraging Recursive Channel Spatial Attention and Convolutional Block Attention to enhance salient feature representation. We further introduce an edge-aware decoder that incorporates a dedicated Edge Extractor for boundary refinement, complemented by Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate uncertainty in predictions. To train our network robustly, we employ a combination of boundary-sensitive and topology-preserving loss functions, including Boundary IoU, Focal Tversky, and Topological Saliency losses. Evaluation metrics such as uncertainty-calibrated error and Boundary F1 score, along with the standard SOD metrics, demonstrate our method's superior ability to produce accurate and reliable saliency maps. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing fine-grained details while quantifying prediction confidence, advancing the state-of-the-art in salient object detection.

Abstract: Natural gradients have been widely studied from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, and it is commonly believed that natural gradients have advantages over standard (Euclidean) gradients in capturing the intrinsic geometric structure of the underlying function space and being invariant under reparameterization. However, for function optimization, a fundamental theoretical issue regarding the existence of natural gradients on the function space remains underexplored. We address this issue by providing a geometric perspective and mathematical framework for studying both natural gradient and standard gradient that is more complete than existing studies. The key tool that unifies natural gradient and standard gradient is a generalized form of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which we name the Generalized Tangent Kernel (GTK). Using a novel orthonormality property of GTK, we show that for a fixed parameterization, GTK determines a Riemannian metric on the entire function space which makes the standard gradient as "natural" as the natural gradient in capturing the intrinsic structure of the parameterized function space. Many aspects of this approach relate to RKHS theory. For the practical side of this theory paper, we showcase that our framework motivates new solutions to the non-immersion/degenerate case of natural gradient and leads to new families of natural/standard gradient descent methods.

Abstract: Tabular medical records remain the most readily available data format for applying machine learning in healthcare. However, traditional data preprocessing ignores valuable contextual information in tables and requires substantial manual cleaning and harmonisation, creating a bottleneck for model development. We introduce TabText, a preprocessing and feature extraction method that leverages contextual information and streamlines the curation of tabular medical data. This method converts tables into contextual language and applies pretrained large language models (LLMs) to generate task-independent numerical representations. These fixed embeddings are then used as input for various predictive tasks. TabText was evaluated on nine inpatient flow prediction tasks (e.g., ICU admission, discharge, mortality) using electronic medical records across six hospitals from a US health system, and on nine publicly available datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, covering tasks such as cancer diagnosis, recurrence, and survival. TabText models trained on unprocessed data from a single hospital (572,964 patient-days, Jan 2018-Dec 2020) achieved accurate performance (AUC 0.75-0.94) when tested prospectively on 265,917 patient-days from Jan 2021-Apr 2022, and generalised well to five additional hospitals not used for training. When augmenting preprocessed tabular records with these contextual embeddings, out-of-sample AUC improved by up to 4 additive percentage points in challenging tasks such as ICU transfer and breast cancer recurrence, while providing little to no benefit for already high-performing tasks. Findings were consistent across both private and public datasets.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) trains deep neural networks to optimize several objectives simultaneously using a shared backbone, which leads to reduced computational costs, improved data efficiency, and enhanced performance through cross-task knowledge sharing. Although recent gradient manipulation techniques aim to find a common descent direction that benefits all tasks, conventional empirical loss minimization still leaves models vulnerable to overfitting and gradient conflicts. To address this, we introduce a novel MTL framework that leverages weight perturbation to regulate gradient norms, thus improving generalization. By adaptively modulating weight perturbations, our approach harmonizes task-specific gradients, reducing conflicts and encouraging more robust learning across tasks. Theoretical insights reveal that controlling the gradient norm through weight perturbation directly contributes to better generalization. Extensive experiments across diverse applications demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing gradient-based MTL techniques in terms of task performance and overall model robustness.

Abstract: Accurately modeling complex, multimodal distributions for rotations in three-dimensions, i.e., the SO(3) group, is challenging due to the curvature of the rotation manifold. The recently described implicit-PDF (IPDF) is a simple, elegant, and effective approach for learning arbitrary distributions on SO(3) up to a given precision. However, inference with IPDF requires $N$ forward passes through the network's final multilayer perceptron (where $N$ places an upper bound on the likelihood that can be calculated by the model), which is prohibitively slow for those without the computational resources necessary to parallelize the queries. In this paper, I introduce AQuaMaM, a neural network capable of both learning complex distributions on the rotation manifold and calculating exact likelihoods for query rotations in a single forward pass. Specifically, AQuaMaM autoregressively models the projected components of unit quaternions as mixtures of uniform distributions that partition their geometrically-restricted domain of values. When trained on an "infinite" toy dataset with ambiguous viewpoints, AQuaMaM rapidly converges to a sampling distribution closely matching the true data distribution. In contrast, the sampling distribution for IPDF dramatically diverges from the true data distribution, despite IPDF approaching its theoretical minimum evaluation loss during training. When trained on a constructed dataset of 500,000 renders of a die in different rotations, AQuaMaM reaches a test log-likelihood 14% higher than IPDF. Further, compared to IPDF, AQuaMaM uses 24% fewer parameters, has a prediction throughput 52$\times$ faster on a single GPU, and converges in a similar amount of time during training.

Abstract: Current imitation learning approaches, predominantly based on deep neural networks (DNNs), offer efficient mechanisms for learning driving policies from real-world datasets. However, they suffer from inherent limitations in interpretability and generalizability--issues of critical importance in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce Symbolic Imitation Learning (SIL), a novel framework that leverages Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to derive explainable and generalizable driving policies from synthetic datasets. We evaluate SIL on real-world HighD and NGSim datasets, comparing its performance with state-of-the-art neural imitation learning methods using metrics such as collision rate, lane change efficiency, and average speed. The results indicate that SIL significantly enhances policy transparency while maintaining strong performance across varied driving conditions. These findings highlight the potential of integrating ILP into imitation learning to promote safer and more reliable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Learning the causes of time-series data is a fundamental task in many applications, spanning from finance to earth sciences or bio-medical applications. Common approaches for this task are based on vector auto-regression, and they do not take into account unknown confounding between potential causes. However, in settings with many potential causes and noisy data, these approaches may be substantially biased. Furthermore, potential causes may be correlated in practical applications or even contain cycles. To address these challenges, we propose a new double machine learning based method for structure identification from temporal data (DR-SIT). We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that our method asymptotically recovers the true underlying causal structure. Our analysis extends to cases where the potential causes have cycles, and they may even be confounded. We further perform extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance of our method.

Abstract: The need to identify graphs with small structural distances from a query arises in domains such as biology, chemistry, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Among several methods for measuring inter-graph distance, Graph Edit Distance (GED) is preferred for its comprehensibility, though its computation is hindered by NP-hardness. Optimization based heuristic methods often face challenges in providing accurate approximations. State-of-the-art GED approximations predominantly utilize neural methods, which, however: (i) lack an explanatory edit path corresponding to the approximated GED; (ii) require the NP-hard generation of ground-truth GEDs for training; and (iii) necessitate separate training on each dataset. In this paper, we propose EUGENE, an efficient, algebraic, and structure-aware optimization based method that estimates GED and also provides edit paths corresponding to the estimated cost. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that EUGENE achieves state-of-the-art GED estimation with superior scalability across diverse datasets and generalized cost settings.

Abstract: Back in the early 20th century, a horse named Hans appeared to perform arithmetic and other intellectual tasks during exhibitions in Germany, while it actually relied solely on involuntary cues in the body language from the human trainer. Modern machine learning models are no different. These models are known to be sensitive to spurious correlations between non-essential features of the inputs (e.g., background, texture, and secondary objects) and the corresponding labels. Such features and their correlations with the labels are known as "spurious" because they tend to change with shifts in real-world data distributions, which can negatively impact the model's generalization and robustness. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this emerging issue, along with a fine-grained taxonomy of existing state-of-the-art methods for addressing spurious correlations in machine learning models. Additionally, we summarize existing datasets, benchmarks, and metrics to facilitate future research. The paper concludes with a discussion of the broader impacts, the recent advancements, and future challenges in the era of generative AI, aiming to provide valuable insights for researchers in the related domains of the machine learning community.

Abstract: This paper addresses federated learning (FL) in the context of malicious Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity. We introduce a novel Robust Average Gradient Algorithm (RAGA), which uses the geometric median for aggregation and {allows flexible round number for local updates.} Unlike most existing resilient approaches, which base their convergence analysis on strongly-convex loss functions or homogeneously distributed datasets, this work conducts convergence analysis for both strongly-convex and non-convex loss functions over heterogeneous datasets. The theoretical analysis indicates that as long as the fraction of the {data} from malicious users is less than half, RAGA can achieve convergence at a rate of $\mathcal{O}({1}/{T^{2/3- \delta}})$ for non-convex loss functions, where $T$ is the iteration number and $\delta \in (0, 2/3)$. For strongly-convex loss functions, the convergence rate is linear. Furthermore, the stationary point or global optimal solution is shown to be attainable as data heterogeneity diminishes. Experimental results validate the robustness of RAGA against Byzantine attacks and demonstrate its superior convergence performance compared to baselines under varying intensities of Byzantine attacks on heterogeneous datasets.

<title>Data Imputation by Pursuing Better Classification: A Supervised Kernel-Based Method</title>

Abstract: Data imputation, the process of filling in missing feature elements for incomplete data sets, plays a crucial role in data-driven learning. A fundamental belief is that data imputation is helpful for learning performance, and it follows that the pursuit of better classification can guide the data imputation process. While some works consider using label information to assist in this task, their simplistic utilization of labels lacks flexibility and may rely on strict assumptions. In this paper, we propose a new framework that effectively leverages supervision information to complete missing data in a manner conducive to classification. Specifically, this framework operates in two stages. Firstly, it leverages labels to supervise the optimization of similarity relationships among data, represented by the kernel matrix, with the goal of enhancing classification accuracy. To mitigate overfitting that may occur during this process, a perturbation variable is introduced to improve the robustness of the framework. Secondly, the learned kernel matrix serves as additional supervision information to guide data imputation through regression, utilizing the block coordinate descent method. The superiority of the proposed method is evaluated on four real-world data sets by comparing it with state-of-the-art imputation methods. Remarkably, our algorithm significantly outperforms other methods when the data is missing more than 60\% of the features

Abstract: We introduce a class of neural networks named PLEIADES (PoLynomial Expansion In Adaptive Distributed Event-based Systems), which contains temporal convolution kernels generated from orthogonal polynomial basis functions. We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.

Abstract: Graph pooling has gained attention for its ability to obtain effective node and graph representations for various downstream tasks. Despite the recent surge in graph pooling approaches, there is a lack of standardized experimental settings and fair benchmarks to evaluate their performance. To address this issue, we have constructed a comprehensive benchmark that includes 17 graph pooling methods and 28 different graph datasets. This benchmark systematically assesses the performance of graph pooling methods in three dimensions, i.e., effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. We first evaluate the performance of these graph pooling approaches across different tasks including graph classification, graph regression and node classification. Then, we investigate their performance under potential noise attacks and out-of-distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. We also involve detailed efficiency analysis, backbone analysis, parameter analysis and visualization to provide more evidence. Extensive experiments validate the strong capability and applicability of graph pooling approaches in various scenarios, which can provide valuable insights and guidance for deep geometric learning research. The source code of our benchmark is available at https://github.com/goose315/Graph_Pooling_Benchmark.

Abstract: Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these datasets.

Abstract: Time series, characterized by a sequence of data points organized in a discrete-time order, are ubiquitous in real-world scenarios. Unlike other data modalities, time series present unique challenges due to their intricate and dynamic nature, including the entanglement of nonlinear patterns and time-variant trends. Analyzing such data is of great significance in practical applications and has been extensively studied for centuries. Recent years have witnessed remarkable breakthroughs in the time series community, with techniques shifting from traditional statistical methods to contemporary deep learning models. In this paper, we delve into the design of deep time series models across various analysis tasks and review the existing literature from two perspectives: basic modules and model architectures. Further, we develop and release Time Series Library (TSLib) as a fair benchmark of deep time series models for diverse analysis tasks. TSLib implements 30 prominent models, covers 30 datasets from different domains, and supports five prevalent analysis tasks. Based on TSLib, we thoroughly evaluate 13 advanced deep time series models across diverse tasks. Empirical results indicate that models with specific structures are well-suited for distinct analytical tasks, providing insights for research and adoption of deep time series models. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but often struggle to align with human preferences, leading to harmful or undesirable outputs. Preference learning, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for ensuring that LLMs align with human values. An essential part of ensuring that LLMs are aligned for all people is accounting for a diverse set of values. This paper introduces a new theoretical framework to analyze how generalization scales with value diversity and sample quantity in models trained with direct preference optimization. Our framework rigorously assesses how well models generalize after a finite number of gradient steps, reflecting real-world LLM training practices. By analyzing the reward margin associated with each sample and its trajectory throughout training, we provide a bound on the generalization error that demonstrates the challenges of effectively learning a wide set of concepts or values. These insights are empirically validated on contemporary LLMs, underscoring the practical relevance of our theory.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet a principled theoretical understanding of its internal mechanisms remains elusive. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that reconceptualizes the Transformer's discrete, layered structure as a continuous spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential Equation (PDE). Within this paradigm, we map core architectural components to distinct mathematical operators: self-attention as a non-local interaction, the feed-forward network as a local reaction, and, critically, residual connections and layer normalization as indispensable stabilization mechanisms. We do not propose a new model, but rather employ the PDE system as a theoretical probe to analyze the mathematical necessity of these components. By comparing a standard Transformer with a PDE simulator that lacks explicit stabilizers, our experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for our central thesis. We demonstrate that without residual connections, the system suffers from catastrophic representational drift, while the absence of layer normalization leads to unstable, explosive training dynamics. Our findings reveal that these seemingly heuristic "tricks" are, in fact, fundamental mathematical stabilizers required to tame an otherwise powerful but inherently unstable continuous system. This work offers a first-principles explanation for the Transformer's design and establishes a new paradigm for analyzing deep neural networks through the lens of continuous dynamics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data, but is vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and data heterogeneity, which can severely degrade performance. Existing Byzantine-robust approaches tackle data heterogeneity, but incur high computational overhead during gradient aggregation, thereby slowing down the training process. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective Federated Normalized Gradients Algorithm (Fed-NGA), which performs aggregation by merely computing the weighted mean of the normalized gradients from each client. This approach yields a favorable time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(pM)$, where $p$ is the model dimension and $M$ is the number of clients. We rigorously prove that Fed-NGA is robust to both Byzantine faults and data heterogeneity. For non-convex loss functions, Fed-NGA achieves convergence to a neighborhood of stationary points under general assumptions, and further attains zero optimality gap under some mild conditions, which is an outcome rarely achieved in existing literature. In both cases, the convergence rate is $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{\frac{1}{2} - \delta})$, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $\delta \in (0, 1/2)$. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the superior time efficiency and convergence performance of Fed-NGA over existing methods.

Abstract: In the last years, an increasing number of learning-based approaches have been proposed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems such as routing problems. Many of these approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related transformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing problems. However, such models are ill-suited for a wide range of real-world problems that feature non-Euclidean and asymmetric edge costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel GNN-based and edge-focused neural model called Graph Edge Attention Network (GREAT). Using GREAT as an encoder to capture the properties of a routing problem instance, we build a reinforcement learning framework which we apply to both Euclidean and non-Euclidean variants of vehicle routing problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and Orienteering Problem. Our framework is among the first to tackle non-Euclidean variants of these problems and achieves competitive results among learning-based benchmarks.

Abstract: Covariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the covariance matrix of input data to leverage correlation information as pairwise connections. They have achieved success in a multitude of applications such as neuroscience, financial forecasting, and sensor networks. However, the empirical covariance matrix on which VNNs operate typically contains spurious correlations, creating a mismatch with the actual covariance matrix that degrades VNNs' performance and computational efficiency. To tackle this issue, we put forth Sparse coVariance Neural Networks (S-VNNs), a framework that applies sparsification techniques on the sample covariance matrix and incorporates the latter into the VNN architecture. We investigate the S-VNN when the underlying data covariance matrix is both sparse and dense. When the true covariance matrix is sparse, we propose hard and soft thresholding to improve the covariance estimation and reduce the computational cost. Instead, when the true covariance is dense, we propose a stochastic sparsification where data correlations are dropped in probability according to principled strategies. Besides performance and computation improvements, we show that S-VNNs are more stable to finite-sample covariance estimations than nominal VNNs and the analogous sparse principal component analysis. By analyzing the impact of sparsification on their behavior, we tie the S-VNN stability to the data distribution and sparsification approach. We support our theoretical findings with experimental results on a variety of application scenarios, ranging from brain data to human action recognition, and show an improved task performance, improved stability, and reduced computational time compared to alternatives.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the applications of operator learning, specifically DeepONet, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike conventional function learning methods that require training separate neural networks for each PDE, operator learning enables generalization across different PDEs without retraining. This study examines the performance of DeepONet in physics-informed training, focusing on two key aspects: (1) the approximation capabilities of deep branch and trunk networks, and (2) the generalization error in Sobolev norms. Our results show that complex branch networks provide substantial performance gains, while trunk networks are most effective when kept relatively simple. Furthermore, we derive a bound on the generalization error of DeepONet for solving nonlinear PDEs by analyzing the Rademacher complexity of its derivatives in terms of pseudo-dimension. This work bridges a critical theoretical gap by delivering rigorous error estimates. This paper fills a theoretical gap by providing error estimates for a wide range of physics-informed machine learning models and applications.

Abstract: Fuelled by the popularity of the transformer architecture in deep learning, several works have investigated what formal languages a transformer can learn from data. Nonetheless, existing results remain hard to compare due to methodological differences. To address this, we construct finite state automata as high-level abstractions of transformers trained on regular languages using queries and counterexamples. Concretely, we extract Moore machines, as many training tasks used in literature can be mapped onto them. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by studying positive-only learning and the sequence accuracy measure in detail.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) is essential for providing credible confidence estimates over their outputs. However, fine-tuned LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in uncertain predictions, which stems from their limited ability to generalize with sparse data. Existing parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs focus on post fine-tuning stage, and thus fail to address the core issue: limited specialization of PEFT adapters to accurately capture task-specific input-output relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Functional-Level Uncertainty Quantification for Calibrated Fine-Tuning (UQ4CT), which captures and calibrates uncertainty over the space of functions that map input prompts to outputs. We implement UQ4CT during the fine-tuning stage via a mixture-of-experts framework that hierarchically decomposes the functional space. Empirically, UQ4CT achieves over $25\%$ reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) while preserving high accuracy across five benchmarks. Even under distribution shift, UQ4CT maintains superior ECE performance with high accuracy, showcasing improved generalizability.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful models for graph learning tasks, exhibiting promising performance in various domains. While their empirical success is evident, there is a growing need to understand their essential ability from a theoretical perspective. Existing theoretical research has primarily focused on the analysis of single-layer GCNs, while a comprehensive theoretical exploration of the stability and generalization of deep GCNs remains limited. In this paper, we bridge this gap by delving into the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, aiming to provide valuable insights by characterizing rigorously the associated upper bounds. Our theoretical results reveal that the stability and generalization of deep GCNs are influenced by certain key factors, such as the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the graph filter operators and the depth of the network. Our theoretical studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, potentially paving the way for developing more reliable and well-performing models.

Abstract: Next location prediction is a critical task in human mobility analysis.Existing methods typically formulate it as a classification task based on discrete location IDs, which hinders spatial continuity modeling and limits generalization to new cities. In this paper, we propose NextLocLLM, a novel framework that reformulates next-location prediction as coordinate regression and integrates LLMs for both location semantics encoding and coordinate-level prediction. To model location functional semantics, it constructs LLM-enhanced POI embeddings by leveraging language understanding capabilities of LLMs to extract functional semantics from textual descriptions of POI categories. These POI embeddings are combined with spatiotemporal trajectory representation and fed into the same LLM, enabling unified semantic and predictive modeling. A lightweight regression head generates coordinate outputs, which are mapped to top-k candidate locations via post-prediction retrieval module, ensuring structured outputs. Experiments across diverse cities show that NextLocLLM outperforms existing baselines in both supervised and zero-shot settings. Code is available at: https://github.com/liuwj2000/NexelocLLM.

Abstract: Training neural networks requires significant computational resources and energy. Methods like mixed-precision and quantization-aware training reduce bit usage, yet they still depend heavily on computationally expensive gradient-based optimization. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift: eliminate gradients altogether. One might hope that, in a finite quantized space, finding optimal weights with out gradients would be easier but we theoretically prove that this problem is NP-hard even in simple settings where the continuous case is efficiently solvable. To address this, we introduce a novel heuristic optimization framework that avoids full weight updates and significantly improves efficiency. Empirically, our method achieves performance comparable to that of full-precision gradient-based training on standard datasets and architectures, while using up to 3x less energy and requiring up to 5x fewer parameter updates.

Abstract: Supervised contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success by leveraging label information; however, determining positive samples in multi-label scenarios remains a critical challenge. In multi-label supervised contrastive learning (MSCL), multi-label relations are not yet fully defined, leading to ambiguity in identifying positive samples and formulating contrastive loss functions to construct the representation space. To address these challenges, we: (i) systematically formulate multi-label relations in MSCL, (ii) propose a novel Similarity-Dissimilarity Loss, which dynamically re-weights samples based on similarity and dissimilarity factors, (iii) further provide theoretical grounded proofs for our method through rigorous mathematical analysis that supports the formulation and effectiveness, and (iv) offer a unified form and paradigm for both single-label and multi-label supervised contrastive loss. We conduct experiments on both image and text modalities and further extend the evaluation to the medical domain. The results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-III-Full.

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution shifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded).By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Motivation: Emerging drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is crucial for new drugs but is hindered by distribution changes between known and new drugs in real-world scenarios. Current evaluation often neglects these changes, relying on unrealistic i.i.d. split due to the absence of drug approval data. Results: We propose DDI-Ben, a benchmarking framework for emerging DDI prediction under distribution changes. DDI-Ben introduces a distribution change simulation framework that leverages distribution changes between drug sets as a surrogate for real-world distribution changes of DDIs, and is compatible with various drug split strategies. Through extensive benchmarking on ten representative methods, we show that most existing approaches suffer substantial performance degradation under distribution changes. Our analysis further indicates that large language model (LLM) based methods and the integration of drug-related textual information offer promising robustness against such degradation. To support future research, we release the benchmark datasets with simulated distribution changes. Overall, DDI-Ben highlights the importance of explicitly addressing distribution changes and provides a foundation for developing more resilient methods for emerging DDI prediction. Availability and implementation: Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LARS-research/DDI-Bench.

Abstract: Plasticity Loss is an increasingly important phenomenon that refers to the empirical observation that as a neural network is continually trained on a sequence of changing tasks, its ability to adapt to a new task diminishes over time. We introduce Self-Normalized Resets (SNR), a simple adaptive algorithm that mitigates plasticity loss by resetting a neuron's weights when evidence suggests its firing rate has effectively dropped to zero. Across a battery of continual learning problems and network architectures, we demonstrate that SNR consistently attains superior performance compared to its competitor algorithms. We also demonstrate that SNR is robust to its sole hyperparameter, its rejection percentile threshold, while competitor algorithms show significant sensitivity. SNR's threshold-based reset mechanism is motivated by a simple hypothesis test that we derive. Seen through the lens of this hypothesis test, competing reset proposals yield suboptimal error rates in correctly detecting inactive neurons, potentially explaining our experimental observations. We also conduct a theoretical investigation of the optimization landscape for the problem of learning a single ReLU. We show that even when initialized adversarially, an idealized version of SNR learns the target ReLU, while regularization based approaches can fail to learn.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Laplacian matrix aiming to enable the construction of spectral convolutional networks and to extend the signal processing applications for directed graphs. Our proposal is inspired by a Haar-like transformation and produces a Hermitian matrix which is not only in one-to-one relation with the adjacency matrix, preserving both direction and weight information, but also enjoys desirable additional properties like scaling robustness, sensitivity, continuity, and directionality. We take a theoretical standpoint and support the conformity of our approach with the spectral graph theory. Then, we address two use-cases: graph learning (by introducing HaarNet, a spectral graph convolutional network built with our Haar-Laplacian) and graph signal processing. We show that our approach gives better results in applications like weight prediction and denoising on directed graphs.

Abstract: Early in training, LMs can behave like n-gram models, but eventually they often learn tree-based syntactic rules and generalize hierarchically out of distribution (OOD). We study this shift using controlled grammar-learning tasks: question formation and tense inflection. We find that a model learns to generalize hierarchically if its training data is _complex_-in particular, if it includes center-embedded clauses, a special syntactic structure. Under this definition, complex data drives hierarchical rules, while less complex data encourages shortcut learning in the form of n-gram-like linear rules. Furthermore, we find that a model uses rules to generalize, whether hierarchical or linear, if its training data is _diverse_-in particular, if it includes many distinct syntax trees in the training set. Under this definition, diverse data promotes stable rule learning, whereas less diverse data promotes memorization of individual syntactic sequences. Finally, intermediate diversity and intermediate complexity form an *unstable regime*, which is characterized by oscillatory learning dynamics and inconsistent behaviors across random seeds. These results highlight the central role of training data in shaping generalization and explain why competing strategies can lead to unstable outcomes.

Abstract: Maximum entropy reinforcement learning integrates exploration into policy learning by providing additional intrinsic rewards proportional to the entropy of some distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which the intrinsic reward function is the relative entropy of the discounted distribution of states and actions (or features derived from these states and actions) visited during future time steps. This approach is motivated by two results. First, a policy maximizing the expected discounted sum of intrinsic rewards also maximizes a lower bound on the state-action value function of the decision process. Second, the distribution used in the intrinsic reward definition is the fixed point of a contraction operator. Existing algorithms can therefore be adapted to learn this fixed point off-policy and to compute the intrinsic rewards. We finally introduce an algorithm maximizing our new objective, and we show that resulting policies have good state-action space coverage and achieve high-performance control.

Abstract: Long-range correlations are essential across numerous machine learning tasks, especially for data embedded in Euclidean space, where the relative positions and orientations of distant components are often critical for accurate predictions. Self-attention offers a compelling mechanism for capturing these global effects, but its quadratic complexity presents a significant practical limitation. This problem is particularly pronounced in computational chemistry, where the stringent efficiency requirements of machine learning force fields (MLFFs) often preclude accurately modeling long-range interactions. To address this, we introduce Euclidean fast attention (EFA), a linear-scaling attention-like mechanism designed for Euclidean data, which can be easily incorporated into existing model architectures. A core component of EFA are novel Euclidean rotary positional encodings (ERoPE), which enable efficient encoding of spatial information while respecting essential physical symmetries. We empirically demonstrate that EFA effectively captures diverse long-range effects, enabling EFA-equipped MLFFs to describe challenging chemical interactions for which conventional MLFFs yield incorrect results.

Abstract: A self-corrector for a function $f$ takes a black-box oracle computing $f$ that is correct on most inputs and turns it into one that is correct on every input with high probability. Self-correctors exist for any function that is randomly self-reducible (RSR), where the value $f$ at a given point $x$ can be recovered by computing $f$ on random correlated points. While RSRs enable powerful self-correction capabilities and have applications in complexity theory and cryptography, their discovery has traditionally required manual derivation by experts. We present Bitween, a method and tool for automated learning of randomized self-reductions for mathematical functions. We make two key contributions: First, we demonstrate that our learning framework based on linear regression outperforms sophisticated methods including genetic algorithms, symbolic regression, and mixed-integer linear programming for discovering RSRs from correlated samples. Second, we introduce Agentic Bitween, a neuro-symbolic approach where large language models dynamically discover novel query functions for RSR property discovery, leveraging vanilla Bitween as a tool for inference and verification, moving beyond the fixed query functions ($x+r$, $x-r$, $x \cdot r$, $x$, $r$) previously used in the literature. On RSR-Bench, our benchmark suite of 80 scientific and machine learning functions, vanilla Bitween surpasses existing symbolic methods, while Agentic Bitween discovers new RSR properties using frontier models to uncover query functions.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning, enabling multiple parties to jointly train models while preserving the privacy of raw graph data. However, existing FGL methods often overlook the model-centric heterogeneous FGL (MHtFGL) problem, which arises in real-world applications, such as the aggregation of models from different companies with varying scales and architectures. MHtFGL presents an additional challenge: the diversity of client model architectures hampers common learning and integration of graph representations. To address this issue, we propose the Federated Graph Knowledge Collaboration (FedGKC) framework, comprising two key components: Client-side Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation, which fosters effective knowledge sharing among clients through copilot models; and Server-side Knowledge-Aware Model Aggregation, which enhances model integration by accounting for the knowledge acquired by clients. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGKC achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.74% over baseline models in MHtFGL scenarios, while also maintaining excellent performance in homogeneous settings.

Abstract: We theoretically analyzed the convergence behavior of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) and found that using an increasing batch size leads to faster convergence than using a constant batch size, not only with a constant learning rate but also with a decaying learning rate, such as cosine annealing decay and polynomial decay. The convergence rate improves from $O(T^{-1}+C)$ with a constant batch size to $O(T^{-1})$ with an increasing batch size, where $T$ denotes the total number of iterations and $C$ is a constant. Using principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion, we investigated, both theoretically and numerically, how an increasing batch size affects computational time as quantified by stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. An increasing batch size was found to reduce the SFO complexity of RSGD. Furthermore, an increasing batch size was found to offer the advantages of both small and large constant batch sizes.

Abstract: In this work, we propose norm-bounded low-rank adaptation (NB-LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine tuning. NB-LoRA is a novel parameterization of low-rank weight adaptations that admits explicit bounds on each singular value of the adaptation matrix, which can thereby satisfy any prescribed unitarily invariant norm bound, including the Schatten norms (e.g., nuclear, Frobenius, spectral norm). The proposed parameterization is unconstrained, smooth, and complete, i.e. it covers all matrices satisfying the prescribed rank and singular-value bounds. Natural language generation experiments show that NB-LoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing LoRA methods, while exhibiting stronger hyper-parameter robustness. Vision fine-tuning experiments show that NB-LoRA can avoid model catastrophic forgetting without minor cost on adaptation performance, and compared to existing approaches it is substantially more robust to a hyper-parameters such as including adaptation rank, learning rate and number of training epochs.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used tool for dimension reduction and denoising. Therefore, it is also widely used on the data prior to training a neural network. However, this approach can complicate the explanation of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods for the decision of the model. In this work, we analyze the potential issues with this approach and propose Principal Components-based Initialization (PCsInit), a strategy to incorporate PCA into the first layer of a neural network via initialization of the first layer in the network with the principal components, and its two variants PCsInit-Act and PCsInit-Sub. We will show that explanations using these strategies are more simple, direct and straightforward than using PCA prior to training a neural network on the principal components. We also show that the proposed techniques possess desirable theoretical properties. Moreover, as will be illustrated in the experiments, such training strategies can also allow further improvement of training via backpropagation compared to training neural networks on principal components.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained clients remains a challenging problem. Recent works have fused low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques with federated fine-tuning to mitigate challenges associated with client model sizes and data scarcity. Still, the heterogeneity of resources remains a critical bottleneck: while higher-rank modules generally enhance performance, varying client capabilities constrain LoRA's feasible rank range. Existing approaches attempting to resolve this issue either lack analytical justification or impose additional computational overhead, leaving a wide gap for efficient and theoretically-grounded solutions. To address these challenges, we propose federated sketching LoRA (FSLoRA), which leverages a sketching mechanism to enable clients to selectively update submatrices of global LoRA modules maintained by the server. By adjusting the sketching ratios, which determine the ranks of the submatrices on the clients, FSLoRA flexibly adapts to client-specific communication and computational constraints. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis of FSLoRA that characterizes how the sketching ratios affect the convergence rate. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and LLM models, we demonstrate FSLoRA's performance improvements compared to various baselines.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) represents a promising paradigm for developing generalist agents that learn at inference time through trial-and-error interactions, analogous to how large language models adapt contextually, but with a focus on reward maximization. However, the scalability of ICRL beyond toy tasks and single-domain settings remains an open challenge. In this work, we present the first steps toward scaling ICRL by introducing a fixed, cross-domain model capable of learning behaviors through in-context reinforcement learning. Our results demonstrate that Algorithm Distillation, a framework designed to facilitate ICRL, offers a compelling and competitive alternative to expert distillation to construct versatile action models. These findings highlight the potential of ICRL as a scalable approach for generalist decision-making systems. Code released at https://github.com/dunnolab/vintix

Abstract: We introduce a practical, black-box framework termed Detection Augmented Learning (DAL) for the problem of non-stationary bandits without prior knowledge of the underlying non-stationarity. DAL accepts any stationary bandit algorithm as input and augments it with a change detector, enabling applicability to all common bandit variants. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that DAL consistently surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across diverse non-stationary scenarios, including synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, underscoring its versatility and scalability. We provide theoretical insights into DAL's strong empirical performance, complemented by thorough experimental validation.

Abstract: Neural network-based optimal transport (OT) is a recent and fruitful direction in the generative modeling community. It finds its applications in various fields such as domain translation, image super-resolution, computational biology and others. Among the existing OT approaches, of considerable interest are adversarial minimax solvers based on semi-dual formulations of OT problems. While promising, these methods lack theoretical investigation from a statistical learning perspective. Our work fills this gap by establishing upper bounds on the generalization error of an approximate OT map recovered by the minimax quadratic OT solver. Importantly, the bounds we derive depend solely on some standard statistical and mathematical properties of the considered functional classes (neural nets). While our analysis focuses on the quadratic OT, we believe that similar bounds could be derived for general OT case, paving the promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models have recently become a powerful tool in the field of generative modeling. In this work, we leverage their power to address another important problem in machine learning and information theory, the estimation of the mutual information (MI) between two random variables. Neatly framing MI estimation as a domain transfer problem, we construct an unbiased estimator for data posing difficulties for conventional MI estimators. We showcase the performance of our estimator on three standard MI estimation benchmarks, i.e., low-dimensional, image-based and high MI, and on real-world data, i.e., protein language model embeddings.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: https://github.com/DL4mHealth/LEAD

<title>Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning for LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing, but their high computational and memory costs hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Binarization represents the most extreme form of quantization, yet binarized models still contain redundancy that can be further removed. Pruning provides a natural way to eliminate such redundancy, but na\"ive combination with binarization often results in severe performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Progressive Binarization with Semi-Structured Pruning (PBS$^2$P), a novel post-training framework that seamlessly integrates binarization and semi-structured pruning. We first propose Stepwise semi-structured Pruning with Binarization Optimization (SPBO), which progressively introduces sparsity while optimizing binarization parameters to jointly reduce pruning and quantization error, yielding more stable and accurate compression. Additionally, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Search (CFS) that first allocates pruning ratios and then refines element selection, further enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families show that PBS$^2$P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) binary post-training quantization methods in both perplexity and downstream accuracy. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PBS2P.

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) enables agents to learn automatically and on-the-fly from their interactive experiences. However, a major challenge in scaling up ICRL is the lack of scalable task collections. To address this, we propose the procedurally generated tabular Markov Decision Processes, named AnyMDP. Through a carefully designed randomization process, AnyMDP is capable of generating high-quality tasks on a large scale while maintaining relatively low structural biases. To facilitate efficient meta-training at scale, we further introduce decoupled policy distillation and induce prior information in the ICRL framework. Our results demonstrate that, with a sufficiently large scale of AnyMDP tasks, the proposed model can generalize to tasks that were not considered in the training set through versatile in-context learning paradigms. The scalable task set provided by AnyMDP also enables a more thorough empirical investigation of the relationship between data distribution and ICRL performance. We further show that the generalization of ICRL potentially comes at the cost of increased task diversity and longer adaptation periods. This finding carries critical implications for scaling robust ICRL capabilities, highlighting the necessity of diverse and extensive task design, and prioritizing asymptotic performance over few-shot adaptation.

<title>Pre-training Epidemic Time Series Forecasters with Compartmental Prototypes</title>

Abstract: Accurate epidemic forecasting is crucial for outbreak preparedness, but existing data-driven models are often brittle. Typically trained on a single pathogen, they struggle with data scarcity during new outbreaks and fail under distribution shifts caused by viral evolution or interventions. However, decades of surveillance data from diverse diseases offer an untapped source of transferable knowledge. To leverage the collective lessons from history, we propose CAPE, the first open-source pre-trained model for epidemic forecasting. Unlike existing time series foundation models that overlook epidemiological challenges, CAPE models epidemic dynamics as mixtures of latent population states, termed compartmental prototypes. It discovers a flexible dictionary of compartment prototypes directly from surveillance data, enabling each outbreak to be expressed as a time-varying mixture that links observed infections to latent population states. To promote robust generalization, CAPE combines self-supervised pre-training objectives with lightweight epidemic-aware regularizers that align the learned prototypes with epidemiological semantics. On a comprehensive benchmark spanning 17 diseases and 50+ regions, CAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines in zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot forecasting. This work represents a principled step toward pre-trained epidemic models that are both transferable and epidemiologically grounded.

Abstract: Semantic caches return cached responses for semantically similar prompts to reduce LLM inference latency and cost. They embed cached prompts and store them alongside their response in a vector database. Embedding similarity metrics assign a numerical score to quantify the similarity between a request and its nearest neighbor prompt from the cache. Existing systems use the same static similarity threshold across all requests to determine whether two prompts can share similar responses. However, we observe that static thresholds do not give formal correctness guarantees, can result in unexpected error rates, and lead to suboptimal cache hit rates. This paper proposes vCache, the first verified semantic cache with user-defined error rate guarantees. It employs an online learning algorithm to estimate an optimal threshold for each cached prompt, enabling reliable cache responses without additional training. Our experiments show that vCache consistently meets the specified error bounds while outperforming state-of-the-art static-threshold and fine-tuned embedding baselines. We release the vCache implementation and three benchmarks to support future research.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a fundamental tool for analyzing multi-dimensional data by learning low-rank factors to represent high-order interactions. While recent works on temporal tensor decomposition have made significant progress by incorporating continuous timestamps in latent factors, they still struggle with general tensor data with continuous indexes not only in the temporal mode but also in other modes, such as spatial coordinates in climate data. Moreover, the challenge of self-adapting model complexity is largely unexplored in functional temporal tensor models, with existing methods being inapplicable in this setting. To address these limitations, we propose functional \underline{C}omplexity-\underline{A}daptive \underline{T}emporal \underline{T}ensor d\underline{E}composition (\textsc{Catte}).
  Our approach encodes continuous spatial indexes as learnable Fourier features and employs neural ODEs in latent space to learn the temporal trajectories of factors. To enable automatic adaptation of model complexity, we introduce a sparsity-inducing prior over the factor trajectories.
  We develop an efficient variational inference scheme with an analytical evidence lower bound, enabling sampling-free optimization. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that \textsc{Catte} not only reveals the underlying ranks of functional temporal tensors but also significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction performance and robustness against noise.

Abstract: We propose a novel online Gaussian process (GP) model that is capable of capturing long-term memory in sequential data in an online learning setting. Our model, Online HiPPO Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (OHSVGP), leverages the HiPPO (High-order Polynomial Projection Operators) framework, which is popularized in the RNN domain due to its long-range memory modeling capabilities. We interpret the HiPPO time-varying orthogonal projections as inducing variables with time-dependent orthogonal polynomial basis functions, which allows the SVGP inducing variables to memorize the process history. We show that the HiPPO framework fits naturally into the interdomain GP framework and demonstrate that the kernel matrices can also be updated online in a recurrence form based on the ODE evolution of HiPPO. We evaluate OHSVGP with online prediction for 1D time series, continual learning in discriminative GP model for data with multidimensional inputs, and deep generative modeling with sparse Gaussian process variational autoencoder, showing that it outperforms existing online GP methods in terms of predictive performance, long-term memory preservation, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate labels are critical for deriving robust machine learning models. Labels are used to train supervised learning models and to evaluate most machine learning paradigms. In this paper, we model the accuracy and cost of a common weak labeling process where annotators assign presence or absence labels to fixed-length data segments for a given event class. The annotator labels a segment as "present" if it sufficiently covers an event from that class, e.g., a birdsong sound event in audio data. We analyze how the segment length affects the label accuracy and the required number of annotations, and compare this fixed-length labeling approach with an oracle method that uses the true event activations to construct the segments. Furthermore, we quantify the gap between these methods and verify that in most realistic scenarios the oracle method is better than the fixed-length labeling method in both accuracy and cost. Our findings provide a theoretical justification for adaptive weak labeling strategies that mimic the oracle process, and a foundation for optimizing weak labeling processes in sequence labeling tasks.

Abstract: Time series modeling and analysis have become critical in various domains. Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) represent a paradigm shift by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical rigor of differential equations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we address key challenges and future research directions. This survey serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage NDEs for advanced time series analysis.

Abstract: Understanding how air traffic controllers construct a mental 'picture' of complex air traffic situations is crucial but remains a challenge due to the inherently intricate, high-dimensional interactions between aircraft, pilots, and controllers. Previous work on modeling the strategies of air traffic controllers and their mental image of traffic situations often centers on specific air traffic control tasks or pairwise interactions between aircraft, neglecting to capture the comprehensive dynamics of an air traffic situation. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-based framework for explaining air traffic situations. Specifically, we employ a Transformer-based multi-agent trajectory model that encapsulates both the spatio-temporal movement of aircraft and social interaction between them. By deriving attention scores from the model, we can quantify the influence of individual aircraft on overall traffic dynamics. This provides explainable insights into how air traffic controllers perceive and understand the traffic situation. Trained on real-world air traffic surveillance data collected from the terminal airspace around Incheon International Airport in South Korea, our framework effectively explicates air traffic situations. This could potentially support and enhance the decision-making and situational awareness of air traffic controllers.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is crucial for real-world spatiotemporal systems, such as climate, energy, and urban environments, where quantifying uncertainty is essential for informed, risk-aware decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions, their application to spatiotemporal forecasting remains limited due to complex spatiotemporal dynamics and high computational demands. we propose CoST, a general forecasting framework that collaborates deterministic and diffusion models for diverse spatiotemporal systems. CoST formulates a mean-residual decomposition strategy: it leverages a powerful deterministic model to capture the conditional mean and a lightweight diffusion model to learn residual uncertainties. This collaborative formulation simplifies learning objectives, improves accuracy and efficiency, and generalizes across diverse spatiotemporal systems. To address spatial heterogeneity, we further design a scale-aware diffusion mechanism to guide the diffusion process. Extensive experiments across ten real-world datasets from climate, energy, communication, and urban systems show that CoST achieves 25\% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Neural surrogate models are powerful and efficient tools in data mining. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks, such as generation and understanding. However, an equally important yet underexplored question is whether LLMs can serve as surrogate models for code execution prediction. To systematically investigate it, we introduce SURGE, a comprehensive benchmark with $1160$ problems covering $8$ key aspects: multi-language programming tasks, competition-level programming problems, repository-level code analysis, high-cost scientific computing, time-complexity-intensive algorithms, buggy code analysis, programs dependent on specific compilers or execution environments, and formal mathematical proof verification. Through extensive analysis of $21$ open-source and proprietary LLMs, we examine scaling laws, data efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Our findings reveal important insights about the feasibility of LLMs as efficient surrogates for computational processes. The benchmark and evaluation framework are available at https://github.com/Imbernoulli/SURGE.

Abstract: Accurately predicting smartphone app usage is challenging due to the sparsity and irregularity of user behavior, especially under cold-start and low-activity conditions. Existing approaches mostly rely on static or attention-only architectures, which struggle to model fine-grained temporal dynamics. We propose TGT, a Transformer framework equipped with a temporal gating module that conditions hidden representations on the hour-of-day. Unlike conventional time embeddings, temporal gating adaptively rescales feature dimensions in a time-aware manner, working orthogonally to self-attention and strengthening temporal sensitivity. TGT further incorporates a context-aware encoder that integrates session sequences and user profiles into a unified representation. Experiments on two real-world datasets, Tsinghua App Usage and LSApp, demonstrate that TGT significantly outperforms 15 competitive baselines, achieving notable gains in HR@1 and maintaining robustness under cold-start scenarios. Beyond accuracy, analysis of gating vectors uncovers interpretable daily usage rhythms, showing that TGT learns human-consistent patterns of app behavior. These results establish TGT as both a powerful and interpretable framework for time-aware app usage prediction.

Abstract: We study regret minimization in repeated first-price auctions (FPAs), where a bidder observes only the realized outcome after each auction -- win or loss. This setup reflects practical scenarios in online display advertising where the actual value of an impression depends on the difference between two potential outcomes, such as clicks or conversion rates, when the auction is won versus lost. We analyze three outcome models: (1) adversarial outcomes without features, (2) linear potential outcomes with features, and (3) linear treatment effects in features. For each setting, we propose algorithms that jointly estimate private values and optimize bidding strategies, achieving near-optimal regret bounds. Notably, our framework enjoys a unique feature that the treatments are also actively chosen, and hence eliminates the need for the overlap condition commonly required in causal inference.

Abstract: Exploration algorithms for reinforcement learning typically replace or augment the reward function with an additional ``intrinsic'' reward that trains the agent to seek previously unseen states of the environment. Here, we consider an exploration algorithm that exploits meta-learning, or learning to learn, such that the agent learns to maximize its exploration progress within a single episode, even between epochs of training. The agent learns a policy that aims to minimize the probability density of new observations with respect to all of its memories. In addition, it receives as feedback evaluations of the current observation density and retains that feedback in a recurrent network. By remembering trajectories of density, the agent learns to navigate a complex and growing landscape of familiarity in real-time, allowing it to maximize its exploration progress even in completely novel states of the environment for which its policy has not been trained.

Abstract: We introduce a sequence-conditioned critic for Soft Actor--Critic (SAC) that models trajectory context with a lightweight Transformer and trains on aggregated $N$-step targets. Unlike prior approaches that (i) score state--action pairs in isolation or (ii) rely on actor-side action chunking to handle long horizons, our method strengthens the critic itself by conditioning on short trajectory segments and integrating multi-step returns -- without importance sampling (IS). The resulting sequence-aware value estimates capture the critical temporal structure for extended-horizon and sparse-reward problems. On local-motion benchmarks, we further show that freezing critic parameters for several steps makes our update compatible with CrossQ's core idea, enabling stable training \emph{without} a target network. Despite its simplicity -- a 2-layer Transformer with $128$--$256$ hidden units and a maximum update-to-data ratio (UTD) of $1$ -- the approach consistently outperforms standard SAC and strong off-policy baselines, with particularly large gains on long-trajectory control. These results highlight the value of sequence modeling and $N$-step bootstrapping on the critic side for long-horizon reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Bilevel reinforcement learning (BRL) has emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models, yet its theoretical foundations, especially sample complexity bounds, remain underexplored. In this work, we present the first sample complexity bound for BRL, establishing a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in continuous state-action spaces. Traditional MDP analysis techniques do not extend to BRL due to its nested structure and non-convex lower-level problems. We overcome these challenges by leveraging the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and the MDP structure to obtain closed-form gradients, enabling tight sample complexity analysis. Our analysis also extends to general bi-level optimization settings with non-convex lower levels, where we achieve state-of-the-art sample complexity results of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ improving upon existing bounds of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$. Additionally, we address the computational bottleneck of hypergradient estimation by proposing a fully first-order, Hessian-free algorithm suitable for large-scale problems.

Abstract: Two-time-scale Stochastic Approximation (SA) is an iterative algorithm with applications in reinforcement learning and optimization. Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.

Abstract: Compute scaling for language model (LM) pretraining has outpaced the growth of human-written texts, leading to concerns that data will become the bottleneck to LM scaling. To continue scaling pretraining in this data-constrained regime, we propose that explicitly modeling and inferring the \emph{latent thoughts} that underlie the text generation process can significantly improve pretraining data efficiency. Intuitively, our approach views web text as the compressed final outcome of a verbose human thought process and that the latent thoughts contain important contextual knowledge and reasoning steps that are critical to data-efficient learning. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through data-constrained continued pretraining for math. We first show that synthetic data approaches to inferring latent thoughts significantly improve data efficiency over training on the same amount of raw data. Furthermore, we demonstrate latent thought inference without a strong teacher, where an LM \emph{bootstraps its own performance} by using an EM algorithm to iteratively improve the capability of the trained LM and the quality of thought-augmented pretraining data. We show that a 1B LM can bootstrap its performance across at least three iterations and significantly outperform baselines trained on raw data, with increasing gains from additional inference compute when performing the E-step. The gains from inference scaling and EM iterations suggest new opportunities for scaling data-constrained pretraining.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for unifying independently fine-tuned models into an integrated framework, significantly enhancing computational efficiency in multi-task learning. Recently, several SVD-based techniques have been introduced to exploit low-rank structures for enhanced merging, but their reliance on such manually designed rank selection often leads to cross-task interference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose AdaRank, a novel model merging framework that adaptively selects the most beneficial singular directions of task vectors to merge multiple models. We empirically show that the dominant singular components of task vectors can cause critical interference with other tasks, and that naive truncation across tasks and layers degrades performance. In contrast, AdaRank dynamically prunes the singular components that cause interference and offers an optimal amount of information to each task vector by learning to prune ranks during test-time via entropy minimization. Our analysis demonstrates that such method mitigates detrimental overlaps among tasks, while empirical results show that AdaRank consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with various backbones and number of tasks, reducing the performance gap between fine-tuned models to nearly 1%.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a flow-based method for learning all-to-all transfer maps among conditional distributions that approximates pairwise optimal transport. The proposed method addresses the challenge of handling the case of continuous conditions, which often involve a large set of conditions with sparse empirical observations per condition. We introduce a novel cost function that enables simultaneous learning of optimal transports for all pairs of conditional distributions. Our method is supported by a theoretical guarantee that, in the limit, it converges to the pairwise optimal transports among infinite pairs of conditional distributions. The learned transport maps are subsequently used to couple data points in conditional flow matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic and benchmark datasets, as well as on chemical datasets in which continuous physical properties are defined as conditions.

Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing the performance of neural networks in computer vision, particularly as architectures become more complex. This work explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The resulting model produces accurate and computationally efficient hyperparameter recommendations across a wide range of vision architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on resource-intensive trial-and-error procedures, our approach achieves competitive or superior Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while substantially reducing computational overhead. Importantly, the models evaluated span image-centric tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation, fundamental components in many image manipulation pipelines including enhancement, restoration, and style transfer. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only rivals established Bayesian methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), but also accelerates tuning for real-world applications requiring perceptual quality and low-latency processing. All generated configurations are publicly available in the LEMUR Neural Network Dataset (https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset), which serves as an open source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research and provides a practical resource to improve training efficiency in image manipulation systems.

Abstract: Generative models face a fundamental challenge: they must simultaneously learn high-level semantic concepts (what to generate) and low-level synthesis details (how to generate it). Conventional end-to-end training entangles these distinct, and often conflicting objectives, leading to a complex and inefficient optimization process. We argue that explicitly decoupling these tasks is key to unlocking more effective and efficient generative modeling. To this end, we propose Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW), a principled two-phase training framework. The first phase is dedicated to building a robust semantic foundation by aligning the early layers of a diffusion model with a powerful pretrained encoder. This provides a strong representational prior, allowing the second phase -- generative full training with alignment loss to refine the representation -- to focus its resources on high-fidelity synthesis. Our analysis confirms that this efficacy stems from functionally specializing the model's early layers for representation. Empirically, our framework achieves a 11.5$\times$ speedup in 350 epochs to reach FID=1.41 compared to single-phase methods like REPA. Code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/ERW.

Abstract: Using the weights of trained Neural Network (NN) models as data modality has recently gained traction as a research field - dubbed Weight Space Learning (WSL). Multiple recent works propose WSL methods to analyze models, evaluate methods, or synthesize weights. Weight space learning methods require populations of trained models as datasets for development and evaluation. However, existing collections of models - called `model zoos' - are unstructured or follow a rudimentary definition of diversity. In parallel, work rooted in statistical physics has identified phases and phase transitions in NN models. Models are homogeneous within the same phase but qualitatively differ from one phase to another. We combine the idea of `model zoos' with phase information to create a controlled notion of diversity in populations. We introduce 12 large-scale zoos that systematically cover known phases and vary over model architecture, size, and datasets. These datasets cover different modalities, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and scientific ML. For every model, we compute loss landscape metrics and validate full coverage of the phases. With this dataset, we provide the community with a resource with a wide range of potential applications for WSL and beyond. Evidence suggests the loss landscape phase plays a role in applications such as model training, analysis, or sparsification. We demonstrate this in an exploratory study of the downstream methods like transfer learning or model weights averaging.

Abstract: Reliable density estimation is fundamental for numerous applications in statistics and machine learning. In many practical scenarios, data are best modeled as mixtures of component densities that capture complex and multimodal patterns. However, conventional density estimators based on uniform histograms often fail to capture local variations, especially when the underlying distribution is highly nonuniform. Furthermore, the inherent discontinuity of histograms poses challenges for tasks requiring smooth derivatives, such as gradient-based optimization, clustering, and nonparametric discriminant analysis. In this work, we present a novel non-parametric approach for multivariate probability density function (PDF) estimation that utilizes minimum description length (MDL)-based binning with quantile cuts. Our approach builds upon tensor factorization techniques, leveraging the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) of a joint probability tensor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic data and a challenging real dry bean classification dataset.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

Abstract: Diffusion models are state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. Yet training these models involves estimating high-dimensional score functions, which in principle suffers from the curse of dimensionality. It is therefore important to understand how low-dimensional structure in the target distribution can be exploited in these models. Here we consider locality structure, which describes certain sparse conditional dependencies among the target random variables. Given some locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This observation motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we then show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization errors, yielding better overall performance. Localized structure also facilitates parallel training, making localized diffusion models potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Modeling and reconstructing multidimensional physical dynamics from sparse and off-grid observations presents a fundamental challenge in scientific research. Recently, diffusion-based generative modeling shows promising potential for physical simulation. However, current approaches typically operate on on-grid data with preset spatiotemporal resolution, but struggle with the sparsely observed and continuous nature of real-world physical dynamics. To fill the gaps, we present SDIFT, Sequential DIffusion in Functional Tucker space, a novel framework that generates full-field evolution of physical dynamics from irregular sparse observations. SDIFT leverages the functional Tucker model as the latent space representer with proven universal approximation property, and represents observations as latent functions and Tucker core sequences. We then construct a sequential diffusion model with temporally augmented UNet in the functional Tucker space, denoising noise drawn from a Gaussian process to generate the sequence of core tensors.
  At the posterior sampling stage, we propose a Message-Passing Posterior Sampling mechanism, enabling conditional generation of the entire sequence guided by observations at limited time steps. We validate SDIFT on three physical systems spanning astronomical (supernova explosions, light-year scale), environmental (ocean sound speed fields, kilometer scale), and molecular (organic liquid, millimeter scale) domains, demonstrating significant improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We present a deep learning model for high-resolution probabilistic precipitation forecasting over an 8-hour horizon in Europe, overcoming the limitations of radar-only deep learning models with short forecast lead times. Our model efficiently integrates multiple data sources - including radar, satellite, and physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) - while capturing long-range interactions, resulting in accurate forecasts with robust uncertainty quantification through consistent probabilistic maps. Featuring a compact architecture, it enables more efficient training and faster inference than existing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses current operational NWP systems, extrapolation-based methods, and deep-learning nowcasting models, setting a new standard for high-resolution precipitation forecasting in Europe, ensuring a balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness on graph-based tasks. However, their predictive confidence is often miscalibrated, typically exhibiting under-confidence, which harms the reliability of their decisions. Existing calibration methods for GNNs normally introduce additional calibration components, which fail to capture the intrinsic relationship between the model and the prediction confidence, resulting in limited theoretical guarantees and increased computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet efficient graph calibration method. We establish a unified theoretical framework revealing that model confidence is jointly governed by class-centroid-level and node-level calibration at the final layer. Based on this insight, we theoretically show that reducing the weight decay of the final-layer parameters alleviates GNN under-confidence by acting on the class-centroid level, while node-level calibration acts as a finer-grained complement to class-centroid level calibration, which encourages each test node to be closer to its predicted class centroid at the final-layer representations. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations for these "vision-first" tasks, as a supplementary channel to language-based reasoning. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising supplement to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.

Abstract: Feature selection removes redundant features to enhanc performance and computational efficiency in downstream tasks. Existing works often struggle to capture complex feature interactions and adapt to diverse scenarios. Recent advances in this domain have incorporated generative intelligence to address these drawbacks by uncovering intricate relationships between features. However, two key limitations remain: 1) embedding feature subsets in a continuous space is challenging due to permutation sensitivity, as changes in feature order can introduce biases and weaken the embedding learning process; 2) gradient-based search in the embedding space assumes convexity, which is rarely guaranteed, leading to reduced search effectiveness and suboptimal subsets. To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1) preserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while ensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space without relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we develop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge into a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions through pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of feature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is introduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second objective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to guide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively navigates the space by balancing multiple objectives. By prioritizing high-potential regions adaptively and eliminating the reliance on convexity assumptions, the RL agent effectively reduces the risk of converging to local optima. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness and explicitness of our model.

Abstract: Continual model merging integrates independently fine-tuned models sequentially without access to the original training data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning. However, existing methods face two critical challenges: parameter interference among tasks, which leads to catastrophic forgetting, and limited adaptability to evolving test distributions. To address these issues, we introduce the task of Test-Time Continual Model Merging (TTCMM), which leverages a small set of unlabeled test samples during inference to alleviate parameter conflicts and handle distribution shifts. We propose MINGLE, a novel framework for TTCMM. MINGLE employs a mixture-of-experts architecture with parameter-efficient, low-rank experts, which enhances adaptability to evolving test distributions while dynamically merging models to mitigate conflicts. To further reduce forgetting, we propose Null-Space Constrained Gating, which restricts gating updates to subspaces orthogonal to prior task representations, thereby suppressing activations on old tasks and preserving past knowledge. We further introduce an Adaptive Relaxation Strategy that adjusts constraint strength dynamically based on interference signals observed during test-time adaptation, striking a balance between stability and adaptability. Extensive experiments on standard continual merging benchmarks demonstrate that MINGLE achieves robust generalization, significantly reduces forgetting, and consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by 7-9\% on average across diverse task orders.

<title>AltLoRA: Towards Better Gradient Approximation in Low-Rank Adaptation with Alternating Projections</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective technique for reducing memory overhead in fine-tuning large language models. However, it often suffers from sub-optimal performance compared with full fine-tuning since the update is constrained in the low-rank space. Recent variants such as LoRA-Pro attempt to mitigate this by adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices to approximate the full gradient. However, LoRA-Pro's solution is not unique, and different solutions can lead to significantly varying performance in ablation studies. Besides, to incorporate momentum or adaptive optimization design, approaches like LoRA-Pro must first compute the equivalent gradient, causing a higher memory cost close to full fine-tuning. A key challenge remains in integrating momentum properly into the low-rank space with lower memory cost. In this work, we propose AltLoRA, an alternating projection method that avoids the difficulties in gradient approximation brought by the joint update design, meanwhile integrating momentum without higher memory complexity. Our theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and further shows that AltLoRA enables stable feature learning and robustness to transformation invariance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate that AltLoRA outperforms LoRA and its variants, narrowing the gap toward full fine-tuning while preserving superior memory efficiency.

Abstract: Designing neural networks within a Hamiltonian framework offers a principled way to ensure that conservation laws are respected in physical systems. While promising, these capabilities have been largely limited to discrete, analytically solvable systems. In contrast, many physical phenomena are governed by PDEs, which govern infinite-dimensional fields through Hamiltonian functionals and their functional derivatives. Building on prior work, we represent the Hamiltonian functional as a kernel integral parameterized by a neural field, enabling learnable function-to-scalar mappings and the use of automatic differentiation to calculate functional derivatives. This allows for an extension of Hamiltonian mechanics to neural PDE solvers by predicting a functional and learning in the gradient domain. We show that the resulting Hamiltonian Neural Solver (HNS) can be an effective surrogate model through improved stability and conserving energy-like quantities across 1D and 2D PDEs. This ability to respect conservation laws also allows HNS models to better generalize to longer time horizons or unseen initial conditions.

Abstract: Numerous works have noted similarities in how machine learning models represent the world, even across modalities. Although much effort has been devoted to uncovering properties and metrics on which these models align, surprisingly little work has explored causes of this similarity. To advance this line of inquiry, this work explores how two factors - dataset overlap and task overlap - influence downstream model similarity. We evaluate the effects of both factors through experiments across model sizes and modalities, from small classifiers to large language models. We find that both task and dataset overlap cause higher representational similarity and that combining them provides the strongest effect. Finally, we consider downstream consequences of representational similarity, demonstrating how greater similarity increases vulnerability to transferable adversarial and jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale nonconvex problems, common in deep learning, demands balancing rapid convergence with computational efficiency. First-order (FO) optimizers, which serve as today's baselines, provide fast convergence and good generalization but often incur high computation and memory costs due to the large size of modern models. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms reduce this burden using estimated gradients, yet their slow convergence in high-dimensional settings limits practicality. We introduce VAMO (VAriance-reduced Mixed-gradient Optimizer), a stochastic variance-reduced method that extends mini-batch SGD with full-batch ZO gradients under an SVRG-style framework. VAMO's hybrid design utilizes a two-point ZO estimator to achieve a dimension-agnostic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T + 1/b)$, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $b$ is the batch-size, surpassing the dimension-dependent slowdown of purely ZO methods and significantly improving over SGD's $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate. Additionally, we propose a multi-point variant that mitigates the $O(1/b)$ error by adjusting the number of estimation points to balance convergence and cost. Importantly, VAMO achieves these gains with smaller dynamic memory requirements than many FO baselines, making it particularly attractive for edge deployment. Experiments including traditional neural network training and LLM finetuning confirm that VAMO not only outperforms established FO and ZO methods, but also does so with a light memory footprint.

Abstract: Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering the systematic reduction of uncertainty. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires a principled approach to exploration. We introduce PiFlow, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, PiFlow serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our \href{https://github.com/amair-lab/PiFlow}{GitHub}.

<title>Scaling Diffusion Transformers Efficiently via $\mu$P</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have emerged as the foundation for vision generative models, but their scalability is limited by the high cost of hyperparameter (HP) tuning at large scales. Recently, Maximal Update Parametrization ($\mu$P) was proposed for vanilla Transformers, which enables stable HP transfer from small to large language models, and dramatically reduces tuning costs. However, it remains unclear whether $\mu$P of vanilla Transformers extends to diffusion Transformers, which differ architecturally and objectively. In this work, we generalize standard $\mu$P to diffusion Transformers and validate its effectiveness through large-scale experiments. First, we rigorously prove that $\mu$P of mainstream diffusion Transformers, including DiT, U-ViT, PixArt-$\alpha$, and MMDiT, aligns with that of the vanilla Transformer, enabling the direct application of existing $\mu$P methodologies. Leveraging this result, we systematically demonstrate that DiT-$\mu$P enjoys robust HP transferability. Notably, DiT-XL-2-$\mu$P with transferred learning rate achieves 2.9 times faster convergence than the original DiT-XL-2. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of $\mu$P on text-to-image generation by scaling PixArt-$\alpha$ from 0.04B to 0.61B and MMDiT from 0.18B to 18B. In both cases, models under $\mu$P outperform their respective baselines while requiring small tuning cost, only 5.5% of one training run for PixArt-$\alpha$ and 3% of consumption by human experts for MMDiT-18B. These results establish $\mu$P as a principled and efficient framework for scaling diffusion Transformers.

Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we show that our framework can successfully address additional scenarios previously intractable for existing methods - neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators for the purpose of trajectory prediction.

Our results give the first provable bounds for unique recovery of SDE parameters given samples from their stationary distributions. We give tight bounds on the number of necessary interventions for linear SDEs, and upper bounds for nonlinear SDEs in the small noise regime. We experimentally validate the recovery of true parameters in synthetic data, and motivated by our theoretical results, demonstrate the advantage of parameterizations with learnable activation functions in application to gene regulatory dynamics.

<title>Not All Models Suit Expert Offloading: On Local Routing Consistency of Mixture-of-Expert Models</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models (LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance (SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

Abstract: Multimodal learning is of continued interest in artificial intelligence-based applications, motivated by the potential information gain from combining different types of data. However, modalities observed in the source environment may differ from the modalities observed in the target environment due to multiple factors, including cost, hardware failure, or the perceived informativeness of a given modality. This shift in missingness between the source and target environment has not been carefully studied. Naive estimation of the information gain associated with including an additional modality without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that modality's value in the target environment. We formalize the problem of missingness, demonstrate its ubiquity, and show that the subsequent distribution shift results in bias when the missingness process is not explicitly accounted for. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance and information gain under missingness through inverse probability weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KL regularization is ubiquitous, yet the design surface, choice of KL direction (forward vs. reverse), normalization (normalized vs. unnormalized), and estimator ($k_1/k_2/k_3$), is scattered across the literature and often intertwined with off-policy estimation. We ask a focused question: under the off-policy setting, what weighting is required for each KL variant so that the surrogate we optimize yields the exact gradient of the intended KL-regularized objective?
  We answer this with a compact, unified derivation we call the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) view. RPG (i) unifies normalized and unnormalized KL variants and shows that the widely-used $k_3$ penalty is exactly the unnormalized KL; (ii) specifies conditions under which REINFORCE-style losses with stop-gradient are gradient-equivalent to fully differentiable surrogates; (iii) identifies and corrects an off-policy importance-weighting mismatch in GRPO's KL term; and (iv) introduces RPG-Style Clip, a truncated-importance-sampling step within RPG-REINFORCE that enables stable, off-policy policy-gradient training at scale.
  On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25), RPG-REINFORCE with RPG-Style Clip improves accuracy by up to $+6$ absolute percentage points over DAPO. Notably, RPG is a stable and scalable RL algorithm for LLM reasoning, realized via (a) a KL-correct objective, (b) truncated importance sampling, and (c) an iterative reference-policy update scheme.

Abstract: In planning, stitching is an ability of algorithms to piece together sub-trajectories of data they are trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption, the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models, essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial structures, they remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint. In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume access to an empirical risk minimizer. In this work, we present a principled theoretical framework analyzing diffusion models, providing a state-of-the-art sample complexity bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our structured decomposition of the score estimation error into statistical and optimization components offers critical insights into how diffusion models can be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance of diffusion models.

<title>ThanoRA: Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely adopted for downstream fine-tuning of foundation models due to its efficiency and zero additional inference cost. Many real-world applications require foundation models to specialize in several specific tasks simultaneously, motivating the need for efficient multi-task downstream adaptation. To address this need, existing studies have primarily explored two directions: Model Merging with LoRA, which shows advantages in training-free scenarios but still lags behind multi-task training in overall performance; and MoE-based LoRA approaches, which improve multi-task learning performance but introduce routers that hinder the mergeability of LoRA parameters and incur considerable inference overhead, thereby limiting real-world deployment practicality. To this end, we propose ThanoRA, a Task Heterogeneity-Aware Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation framework that enables effective, efficient and unified multi-task downstream adaptation without introducing additional structure. ThanoRA performs multi-task learning by tailoring subspace allocation at initialization and enforcing diversity preservation throughout training: it allocates varying dimensions to construct task-specific low-rank subspaces driven by inter-task heterogeneity, enabling fine-grained knowledge injection, while diversity-preserving regularization mitigates task interference and subspace collapse, thereby fully exploiting the low-rank capacity. Extensive experiments across multimodal and text-only benchmarks under varying multi-task mixtures demonstrate that ThanoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, surpassing even separate task-specific fine-tuning, while introducing no additional structures or inference overhead. Our code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/LiangJian24/ThanoRA.

<title>LoTA-QAF: Lossless Ternary Adaptation for Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Quantization and fine-tuning are crucial for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices. However, fine-tuning quantized models presents significant challenges, primarily stemming from: First, the mismatch in data types between the low-precision quantized weights (e.g., 4-bit) and the high-precision adaptation weights (e.g., 16-bit). This mismatch limits the computational efficiency advantage offered by quantized weights during inference. Second, potential accuracy degradation when merging these high-precision adaptation weights into the low-precision quantized weights, as the adaptation weights often necessitate approximation or truncation. Third, as far as we know, no existing methods support the lossless merging of adaptation while adjusting all quantized weights. To address these challenges, we introduce lossless ternary adaptation for quantization-aware fine-tuning (LoTA-QAF). This is a novel fine-tuning method specifically designed for quantized LLMs, enabling the lossless merging of ternary adaptation weights into quantized weights and the adjustment of all quantized weights. LoTA-QAF operates through a combination of: i) A custom-designed ternary adaptation (TA) that aligns ternary weights with the quantization grid and uses these ternary weights to adjust quantized weights. ii) A TA-based mechanism that enables the lossless merging of adaptation weights. iii) Ternary signed gradient descent (t-SignSGD) for updating the TA weights. We apply LoTA-QAF to Llama-3.1/3.3 and Qwen-2.5 model families and validate its effectiveness on several downstream tasks. On the MMLU benchmark, our method effectively recovers performance for quantized models, surpassing 16-bit LoRA by up to 5.14\%. For task-specific fine-tuning, 16-bit LoRA achieves superior results, but LoTA-QAF still outperforms other methods. Code: github.com/KingdalfGoodman/LoTA-QAF.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks, yet they often exhibit difficulty in distinguishing task-relevant from irrelevant signals -- particularly in tasks like Visual Question Answering -- which can lead to susceptibility to misleading or spurious inputs. We refer to this broader limitation as the Cross-Modality Competency Problem -- the model's inability to fairly evaluate all modalities. This vulnerability becomes more evident in modality-specific tasks -- such as image classification or pure text question answering -- where models are expected to rely solely on one modality. In such tasks, spurious information from irrelevant modalities often leads to significant performance degradation. We refer to this failure as Modality Interference, which serves as a concrete and measurable instance of the cross-modality competency problem, and we further design a perturbation-based causal diagnostic experiment to verify and quantify this problem. To mitigate modality interference, we propose a novel framework to finetune MLLMs, including perturbation-based data augmentations with both heuristic perturbations and adversarial perturbations, and a consistency regularization strategy applying on model outputs with original and perturbed inputs. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets (image-heavy, text-heavy and multimodal tasks) and multiple model families with different scales demonstrate significant improvements in robustness and cross-modality competency, indicating our method's effectiveness in boosting unimodal reasoning ability while enhancing performance on multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Learning-based systems are increasingly deployed across various domains, yet the complexity of traditional neural networks poses significant challenges for formal verification. Unlike conventional neural networks, learned Logic Gate Networks (LGNs) replace multiplications with Boolean logic gates, yielding a sparse, netlist-like architecture that is inherently more amenable to symbolic verification, while still delivering promising performance. In this paper, we introduce a SAT encoding for verifying global robustness and fairness in LGNs. We evaluate our method on five benchmark datasets, including a newly constructed 5-class variant, and find that LGNs are both verification-friendly and maintain strong predictive performance.

Abstract: Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper architectures. This paper identifies the root cause and provides a principled solution. We uncover that the canonical state-based formulation of PC (sPC) is, by design, deeply inefficient on digital hardware, due to an inherent signal decay problem that scales exponentially with depth. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel reparameterization of PC, named error-based PC (ePC), which does not suffer from signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, ePC enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and unattenuated, converging orders of magnitude faster than sPC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that ePC matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where sPC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling bio-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models generalize remarkably well in-distribution, despite being overparametrized and trained with little to no explicit regularization. Instead, current theory credits implicit regularization imposed by the choice of architecture, hyperparameters and optimization procedure. However, deep neural networks can be surprisingly non-robust, resulting in overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalization. Bayesian deep learning addresses this via model averaging, but typically requires significant computational resources as well as carefully elicited priors to avoid overriding the benefits of implicit regularization. Instead, in this work, we propose to regularize variational neural networks solely by relying on the implicit bias of (stochastic) gradient descent. We theoretically characterize this inductive bias in overparametrized linear models as generalized variational inference and demonstrate the importance of the choice of parametrization. Empirically, our approach demonstrates strong in- and out-of-distribution performance without additional hyperparameter tuning and with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Function-guided protein design is a crucial task with significant applications in drug discovery and enzyme engineering. However, the field lacks a unified and comprehensive evaluation framework. Current models are assessed using inconsistent and limited subsets of metrics, which prevents fair comparison and a clear understanding of the relationships between different evaluation criteria. To address this gap, we introduce PDFBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for function-guided denovo protein design. Our benchmark systematically evaluates eight state-of-the-art models on 16 metrics across two key settings: description-guided design, for which we repurpose the Mol-Instructions dataset, originally lacking quantitative benchmarking, and keyword-guided design, for which we introduce a new test set, SwissTest, created with a strict datetime cutoff to ensure data integrity. By benchmarking across a wide array of metrics and analyzing their correlations, PDFBench enables more reliable model comparisons and provides key insights to guide future research.

Abstract: Two-way partial AUC (TPAUC) is a critical performance metric for binary classification with imbalanced data, as it focuses on specific ranges of the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR). However, stochastic algorithms for TPAUC optimization remain under-explored, with existing methods either limited to approximated TPAUC loss functions or burdened by sub-optimal complexities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two innovative stochastic primal-dual double block-coordinate algorithms for TPAUC maximization. These algorithms utilize stochastic block-coordinate updates for both the primal and dual variables, catering to both convex and non-convex settings. We provide theoretical convergence rate analyses, demonstrating significant improvements over prior approaches. Our experimental results, based on multiple benchmark datasets, validate the superior performance of our algorithms, showcasing faster convergence and better generalization. This work advances the state of the art in TPAUC optimization and offers practical tools for real-world machine learning applications.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced the modeling of 3D molecular structure by leveraging group representations. However, their message passing, heavily relying on Clebsch-Gordan tensor product convolutions, suffers from restricted expressiveness due to the limited non-linearity and low degree of group representations. To overcome this, we introduce the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel plug-and-play framework that applies a Transformer-like architecture to the Fourier spatial domain of group representations. EST achieves higher expressiveness than conventional models while preserving the crucial equivariant inductive bias through a uniform sampling strategy of spherical Fourier transforms. As demonstrated by our experiments on challenging benchmarks like OC20 and QM9, EST-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance. For the complex molecular systems within OC20, small models empowered by EST can outperform some larger models and those using additional data. In addition to demonstrating such strong expressiveness,we provide both theoretical and experimental validation of EST's equivariance as well, paving the way for new research in this area.

Abstract: Distributed machine learning workloads use data and tensor parallelism for training and inference, both of which rely on the AllReduce collective to synchronize gradients or activations. However, AllReduce algorithms are delayed by the slowest GPU to reach the synchronization barrier before the collective (i.e., the straggler). To address this challenge, we propose StragglAR: a parallel algorithm for AllReduce that accelerates distributed training and inference by exploiting natural variation in GPU execution times. StragglAR implements a ReduceScatter among the remaining GPUs during the straggler-induced delay, and then executes a novel collective algorithm to complete the AllReduce once the final GPU reaches the synchronization barrier. StragglAR achieves a 2x theoretical speedup over popular bandwidth-efficient algorithms for large GPU clusters, surpassing the lower bound for bandwidth-optimal synchronous AllReduce by leveraging the asymmetry in when GPUs reach the synchronization barrier. On an 8-GPU server, StragglAR provides a 25% speedup over state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms.

Abstract: Modern language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive alternative. Our work provides new theoretical guarantees and algorithms for CoT2, motivated by logical reasoning tasks that inherently require search capabilities. Theoretically, we establish how CoT2 facilitates the model to track multiple discrete traces in parallel; and quantify the level of achievable parallelism and its benefits for inference efficiency. We also provide a CoT2-based one-layer transformer construction that solves the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given a sufficient embedding dimension. These insights arise from a novel and effective supervision strategy where we match the language model outputs to the empirical token distributions of a set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that unlock policy optimization methods for CoT2. Our primary strategy samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the level of parallelism. Experiments confirm that (i) the optimal level of parallelism is governed by the embedding dimension, (ii) our continuous supervision strategy can outperform alternative methods, and (iii) policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from the Internet that helps them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models (VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g., unable to recognize the 4th stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of 17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo) across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical illusions, to patterned grids. Removing image backgrounds nearly doubles accuracy (21.09 percentage points), revealing that contextual visual cues trigger these biased responses. Further analysis of VLMs' reasoning patterns shows that counting accuracy initially rises with thinking tokens, reaching ~40%, before declining with excessive reasoning. Our work presents an interesting failure mode in VLMs and a human-supervised automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code and data are available at: vlmsarebiased.github.io.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) refers to the phenomenon where a strong student model, trained on a dataset labeled by a weak teacher, ultimately outperforms the teacher on the target task. Recent studies attribute this performance gain to the prediction misfit between the student and teacher models. In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG through a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence. Specifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student and teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models. While this aligns with previous results, our analysis removes several restrictive assumptions, most notably, the convexity of the student's hypothesis class, required in earlier works. Moreover, we show that W2SG is more likely to emerge when the student model approximates its posterior mean teacher, rather than mimicking an individual teacher. Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that if the student model size is sufficiently large, it can indeed converge to the posterior mean teacher in expectation. Our analysis also suggests that avoiding overfitting to the teacher's supervision and reducing the entropy of student's prediction further facilitate W2SG. In addition, we show that the reverse cross-entropy loss, unlike the standard forward cross-entropy, is less sensitive to the predictive uncertainty of the teacher. Finally, we empirically verify our theoretical insights and demonstrate that incorporating the reverse cross-entropy loss consistently improves student performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, but their long-context reasoning remains constrained by the excessive memory required for the Key-Value (KV) cache. This makes KV cache compression a critical step toward efficient long-context inference. Recent methods have explored low-rank techniques to reduce the hidden size of the KV cache. However, they neglect the distinct roles and varying importance of Keys and Values, leading to significant performance drops under high compression. To address this, we propose ReCalKV, a post-training low-rank KV cache compression approach with tailored strategies for Keys and Values. For Keys, we propose Head-wise Similarity aware Reordering (HSR), which clusters structurally similar heads into groups, enabling more accurate low-rank approximation via grouped SVD. For Values, we propose Offline Value Calibration (OVC), which efficiently calibrates the value projection matrix using calibration data without training, ensuring an accurate representation of contextual information. Extensive experiments show that ReCalKV consistently outperforms existing low-rank compression methods, achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance loss. The code and models will be available at:https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/ReCalKV.

Abstract: We introduce WARP (Weight-space Adaptive Recurrent Prediction), a simple yet powerful model that unifies weight-space learning with linear recurrence to redefine sequence modeling. Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which collapse temporal dynamics into fixed-dimensional hidden states, WARP explicitly parametrizes its hidden state as the weights and biases of a distinct auxiliary neural network, and uses input differences to drive its recurrence. This brain-inspired formulation enables efficient gradient-free adaptation of the auxiliary network at test-time, in-context learning abilities, and seamless integration of domain-specific physical priors. Empirical validation shows that WARP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on diverse classification tasks, featuring in the top three in 5 out of 6 real-world challenging datasets. Furthermore, extensive experiments across sequential image completion, multivariate time series forecasting, and dynamical system reconstruction demonstrate its expressiveness and generalisation capabilities. Remarkably, a physics-informed variant of our model outperforms the next best model by more than 10x. Ablation studies confirm the architectural necessity of key components, solidifying weight-space linear RNNs as a transformative paradigm for adaptive machine intelligence.

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from sample inefficiency due to the redundant exposure of identical queries under uniform data sampling. While previous work has explored curriculum learning via heuristic difficulty metrics, these strategies exhibit limitations by neglecting the intrinsic learning signals generated by the model itself, thus leading to suboptimal training regimes. In this paper, we identify a model-inherent signal termed angle concentration that effectively reflects an LLM's capacity to learn from specific data. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate a correlation between the angular distribution of token hidden state vectors and the resulting gradient, revealing a learning preference for data exhibiting higher angle concentration. Inspired by this finding, we propose GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework. By leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal, GAIN-RL dynamically selects training data in each epoch, ensuring consistently impactful gradient updates and thus significantly enhancing overall training efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that GAIN-RL (GRPO) achieves over a 2.5x acceleration in training efficiency across diverse mathematical and coding tasks and varying model scales. Furthermore, GAIN-RL (GRPO)'s efficient sampling yields data-efficient training, achieving better performance with half the original data compared to vanilla GRPO with full training data. Code is realsed at https://github.com/wangqinsi1/GAINRL/tree/main.

Abstract: Recent efficient sequence modeling methods such as Gated DeltaNet, TTT, and RWKV-7 have achieved performance improvements by supervising the recurrent memory management through Delta learning rule. Unlike previous state-space models (e.g., Mamba) and gated linear attentions (e.g., GLA), these models introduce interactions between the recurrent state and the key vector, structurally resembling bilinear systems. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Bilinear RNNs with a comprehensive analysis on the advantages and limitations of these models. Then, based on closed-loop control theory, we propose a novel Bilinear RNN variant named Comba, which adopts a scalar-plus-low-rank state transition, with both state feedback and output feedback corrections. We also implement a hardware-efficient chunk-wise parallel kernel in Triton and train models with 340M/1.3B parameters on large-scale corpus. Comba demonstrates superior performance and computation efficiency in both language and vision modeling.

Abstract: The Multi-Head Attention mechanism is central to LLM operation, and multiple works target its compute and memory efficiency during training. While most works focus on approximating the scaled dot product, the memory consumption of the linear projections that compute the $Q$, $K$, and $V$ tensors from the input $x$ is often overlooked. To address this, we propose Point-Approximate Matrix Multiplication (PAMM), a novel tensor compression technique that reduces memory consumption of the $Q,K,V$ projections in attention layers by a factor of up to $\times 512$, effectively erasing their memory footprint, while achieving similar or better final perplexity. PAMM is fully composable with efficient attention techniques such as FlashAttention, making it a practical and complementary method for memory-efficient LLM training.

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore, inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

<title>Curse of Slicing: Why Sliced Mutual Information is a Deceptive Measure of Statistical Dependence</title>

Abstract: Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) is widely used as a scalable alternative to mutual information for measuring non-linear statistical dependence. Despite its advantages, such as faster convergence, robustness to high dimensionality, and nullification only under statistical independence, we demonstrate that SMI is highly susceptible to data manipulation and exhibits counterintuitive behavior. Through extensive benchmarking and theoretical analysis, we show that SMI saturates easily, fails to detect increases in statistical dependence (even under linear transformations designed to enhance the extraction of information), prioritizes redundancy over informative content, and in some cases, performs worse than simpler dependence measures like the correlation coefficient.

Abstract: The use of target networks in deep reinforcement learning is a widely popular solution to mitigate the brittleness of semi-gradient approaches and stabilize learning. However, target networks notoriously require additional memory and delay the propagation of Bellman updates compared to an ideal target-free approach. In this work, we step out of the binary choice between target-free and target-based algorithms. We introduce a new method that uses a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network. This simple modification enables us to keep the target-free's low-memory footprint while leveraging the target-based literature. We find that combining our approach with the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning consecutive Bellman updates in parallel, helps improve the sample-efficiency of target-free approaches. Our proposed method, iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), bridges the performance gap between target-free and target-based approaches across various problems, while using a single Q-network, thus being a step forward towards resource-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose $\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for resource-constrained LLM adaptation.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this, we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance. Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models, the training dynamics of RL in LLMs remain unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation of the RL training process through empirical analysis and rigorous theoretical modeling. First, through systematic reasoning-pattern-level and token-level analysis across the RL training process, we show that while different reasoning patterns exhibit relatively stable success rates during training, RL primarily optimizes a sparse subset of critical tokens, thereby reshaping reasoning pattern distributions to affect model performance. Building on these empirical insights, we develop a theoretical framework to understand the training dynamics of RL with two typical rewards: verifiable reward (RLVR) and model's internal feedback (RLIF). For RLVR, we analyze the training dynamics under two special cases: one where models readily converge to optimal reasoning strategies, and another where optimization becomes challenging, revealing that the base model's reasoning quality is crucial for determining convergence behavior. For RLIF, we examine how internal rewards initially improve model performance but can potentially lead to degradation with continued training. Extensive experiments validate our findings, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications of RL in language model enhancement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However, a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff$\text{'}$s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids) we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: We study the corruption-robustness of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), focusing on the Decision-Pretrained Transformer (DPT, Lee et al., 2023). To address the challenge of reward poisoning attacks targeting the DPT, we propose a novel adversarial training framework, called Adversarially Trained Decision-Pretrained Transformer (AT-DPT). Our method simultaneously trains an attacker to minimize the true reward of the DPT by poisoning environment rewards, and a DPT model to infer optimal actions from the poisoned data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach against standard bandit algorithms, including robust baselines designed to handle reward contamination. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms these baselines in bandit settings, under a learned attacker. We additionally evaluate AT-DPT on an adaptive attacker, and observe similar results. Furthermore, we extend our evaluation to the MDP setting, confirming that the robustness observed in bandit scenarios generalizes to more complex environments.

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) is a central challenge in interpretability research. Existing feature interpretability methods often rely on strong assumptions about the structure of representations that may not hold in practice. In this work, we introduce InverseScope, an assumption-light and scalable framework for interpreting neural activations via input inversion. Given a target activation, we define a distribution over inputs that generate similar activations and analyze this distribution to infer the encoded information. To address the inefficiency of sampling in high-dimensional spaces, we propose a novel conditional generation architecture that significantly improves sample efficiency compared to previous method. We further introduce a quantitative evaluation protocol that tests interpretability hypotheses using the feature consistency rate computed over the sampled inputs. InverseScope scales inversion-based interpretability methods to larger models and practical tasks, enabling systematic and quantitative analysis of internal representations in real-world LLMs.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models, like continuous diffusion models, generate high-quality samples by gradually undoing noise applied to datapoints with a Markov process. Gradual generation in theory comes with many conceptual benefits; for example, inductive biases can be incorporated into the noising Markov process, and access to improved sampling algorithms. In practice, however, the consistently best performing discrete diffusion model is, surprisingly, masking diffusion, which does not denoise gradually. Here we explain the superior performance of masking diffusion by noting that it makes use of a fundamental difference between continuous and discrete Markov processes: discrete Markov processes evolve by discontinuous jumps at a fixed rate and, unlike other discrete diffusion models, masking diffusion builds in the known distribution of jump times and only learns where to jump to. We show that we can similarly bake in the known distribution of jump times into any discrete diffusion model. The resulting models - schedule-conditioned discrete diffusion (SCUD) - generalize classical discrete diffusion and masking diffusion. By applying SCUD to models with noising processes that incorporate inductive biases on images, text, and protein data, we build models that outperform masking.

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose three fundamental challenges involving channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed simultaneously to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, existing architectures typically address only parts of these challenges in isolation and still rely on simplifying assumptions, leaving unresolved the combined challenges of asynchronous channel sampling, test-time missing blocks, and intricate inter-channel dependencies. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting framework with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets reflecting practical settings, along with one private real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

Abstract: Designing ligand-binding proteins with precise functions is fundamental to advances in biology and chemistry, yet existing AI approaches are limited by scarce protein-ligand complex data. Meanwhile, abundant text descriptions of protein-ligand interactions remain underutilized. We introduce InstructPro, a family of generative models that design proteins from natural language instructions and ligand formulas. InstructPro produces protein sequences consistent with specified functional descriptions and ligand targets. To enable training and evaluation, we develop InstructProBench, a large-scale dataset of 9.6 million (function description, ligand, protein) triples. We train two model variants: InstructPro-1B and InstructPro-3B, which substantially outperform strong baselines. InstructPro-1B achieves design success rates of 2.46% (seen ligands) and 3.14% (zero-shot), while InstructPro-3B reaches 5.06% and 3.93%, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of natural language-guided generative modeling to expand protein design capabilities beyond traditional data limitations.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper, we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including for back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train models to perform in-context learning in these settings. We show that CausalFM achieves competitive in-context learning performance even when compared to baselines that are specifically trained for the task at hand. In sum, our framework can be used as a general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference, CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other disciplines.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse applications. In certain scenarios, like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users. Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the delta weights between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model. However, they exhibit inadequate performance at high compression ratios due to their empirical nature. In this work, we introduce DeltaMix, an adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression framework designed to minimize quantization error in the singular value decomposition (SVD) space without imposing additional assumptions. DeltaMix provides a theoretical justification for the necessity of mixed-precision compression and presents a practical quantization solution that involves solving a 0/1 linear integer programming problem alongside a reconstruction target correction method. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks illustrate that DeltaMix consistently outperforms all baseline methods. Notably, on tasks such as AIME2024 and GQA, DeltaMix exceeds the performance of the best baseline, Delta-CoMe, by 22.3\% and 6.1\% for 7B parameter models, respectively.

Abstract: We propose an entirely new meta-learning framework for network pruning. It is a general framework that can be theoretically applied to almost all types of networks with all kinds of pruning and has great generality and transferability. Experiments have shown that it can achieve outstanding results on many popular and representative pruning tasks (including both CNNs and Transformers). Unlike all prior works that either rely on fixed, hand-crafted criteria to prune in a coarse manner, or employ learning to prune ways that require special training during each pruning and lack generality. Our framework can learn complex pruning rules automatically via a neural network (metanetwork) and has great generality that can prune without any special training. More specifically, we introduce the newly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A metanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a modified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective mapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural network as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning strategy automatically and can transform a network that is hard to prune into another network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained, our pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and some standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yewei-Liu/MetaPruning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models (LLMs), commonly referred to as LLM unlearning, seeks to remove specific undesirable data or knowledge from a trained model, while maintaining its performance on standard tasks. While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, even a simple supervised classifier can determine whether a model has undergone unlearning, using only its prediction logits or even its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that unlearning traces can be detected with over 90% accuracy even under forget-irrelevant inputs, and that larger LLMs exhibit stronger detectability. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned, given an input query.

Abstract: The pursuit of faster optimization algorithms remains an active and important research direction in deep learning. Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.

Abstract: We investigate a general approach for improving user prompts in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models by finding prompts that maximize a reward function specified at test-time. Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, running 4.8 times faster than naive reward-agnostic test-time search baseline on average. Furthermore, with sufficient inference budget, it can achieve comparable performance to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm, simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of fixed preference datasets.

<title>Origins of Creativity in Attention-Based Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how `creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g., (Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process. However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself (translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise `mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

Abstract: Inference-time techniques such as decoding-time scaling and self-refinement have been shown to substantially improve reasoning in large language models (LLMs), driven by emergent self-correction and self-verification behaviors often elicited through reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we investigate whether these inference-time scaling methods similarly benefit vision-language models (VLMs), especially those fine-tuned with RL. Through extensive evaluation, we find that while strategies like majority vote and best-of-N with self-verification enhance VLM performance, majority vote significantly outperforms verification-centric ones. Furthermore, inference time scaling behaviors commonly associated with RL-tuned models, such as the 'A-ha moment,' do not yield consistent performance gains. Our analysis identifies a key limitation: current RL-trained VLMs exhibit weak self-verification across both visual and textual modalities, limiting the effectiveness of inference-time scaling.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semantic collapsing problem in generative personalization, an under-explored topic where the learned visual concept ($V$) gradually shifts from its original textual meaning and comes to dominate other concepts in multi-concept input prompts. This issue not only reduces the semantic richness of complex input prompts like "a photo of $V$ wearing glasses and playing guitar" into simpler, less contextually rich forms such as "a photo of $V$" but also leads to simplified output images that fail to capture the intended concept. We identify the root cause as unconstrained optimisation, which allows the learned embedding $V$ to drift arbitrarily in the embedding space, both in direction and magnitude. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method that adjusts the magnitude and direction of pre-trained embedding at inference time, effectively mitigating the semantic collapsing problem. Our method is broadly applicable across different personalization methods and demonstrates significant improvements in text-image alignment in diverse use cases.

<title>Data Uniformity Improves Training Efficiency and More, with a Convergence Framework Beyond the NTK Regime</title>

Abstract: Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including in large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties such as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known to enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist other quantitative and general principles of data selection that can consistently improve performance, especially for complicated tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly distributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance. Specifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads to a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by $h_{\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\min}$ can slow down the training dynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the approximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\min}$ increases. Our analysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including transformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further provides theoretical justification for the use of residual connection and function composition in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct comprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings, including different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by maximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves comparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored. In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical framework, we further show how to model the entire training trajectory. This framework allows quantifying the capability limit of self-improvement by fitting the theoretical model to the experiment results. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical framework on various LLMs and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which accords with the empirical observations.

<title>Overcoming Long-Context Limitations of State-Space Models via Context-Dependent Sparse Attention</title>

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a model to recall a value associated with a single key without context, insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling. To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention (CISA).

Abstract: Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality. To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs). Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.

Abstract: Iterative heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we exploit a critical observation: a large portion of the solution remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA) decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. FSTA preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be aggregated. To this end, we introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg), a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants: non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate), autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy. Empirical results on CVRP and VRPTW show that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art solvers by 2x to 7x. We further provide in-depth analysis showing why synergy achieves the best performance. Notably, L2Seg is compatible with traditional, learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting various VRPs.

Abstract: Differentiable programming has emerged as a powerful paradigm in scientific computing, enabling automatic differentiation through simulation pipelines and naturally supporting both forward and inverse modeling. We present JAX-MPM, a general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver based on the material point method (MPM) and implemented in the modern JAX architecture. The solver adopts a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to capture large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard applications. Leveraging GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation, JAX-MPM enables efficient gradient-based optimization directly through its time-stepping solvers and supports joint training of physical models with deep learning to infer unknown system conditions and uncover hidden constitutive parameters. We validate JAX-MPM through a series of 2D and 3D benchmark simulations, including dam-break and granular collapse problems, demonstrating both numerical accuracy and GPU-accelerated performance. Results show that a high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million particles completes 1000 time steps in approximately 22 seconds (single precision) and 98 seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond high-fidelity forward modeling, we demonstrate the framework's inverse modeling capabilities through tasks such as velocity field reconstruction and the estimation of spatially varying friction from sparse data. In particular, JAX-MPM accommodates data assimilation from both Lagrangian (particle-based) and Eulerian (region-based) observations, and can be seamlessly coupled with neural network representations. These results establish JAX-MPM as a unified and scalable differentiable meshfree platform that advances fast physical simulation and data assimilation for complex solid and geophysical systems.

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they seek to remove by incorporating it into their fine-tuning data. We argue this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we propose a novel unlearning method-Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information from model outputs. Our central insight is that model collapse can be leveraged for machine unlearning by deliberately triggering it for data we aim to remove. We theoretically analyze that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the model unlearns the data targeted for removal. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes three key limitations of existing unlearning methods that explicitly optimize on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from model outputs while preserving general model utility. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we propose an offline preference optimization method to approach trajectory alignment for discrete diffusion models. Instead of applying the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise alignment objectives by matching the per-step posterior. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization, is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, yields an equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design, protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 81.2 on LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Abstract: This document proposes a parametric activation function (ac.f.) aimed at improving multidimensional nonlinear data regression. It is a established knowledge that nonlinear ac.f's are required for learning nonlinear datasets. This work shows that smoothness and gradient properties of the ac.f. further impact the performance of large neural networks in terms of overfitting and sensitivity to model parameters. Smooth but vanishing-gradient ac.f's such as ELU or SiLU (Swish) have limited performance and non-smooth ac.f's such as RELU and Leaky-RELU further impart discontinuity in the trained model. Improved performance is demonstrated with a smooth "Leaky Exponential Linear Unit", with non-zero gradient that can be trained. A novel diffusion-loss metric is also proposed to gauge the performance of the trained models in terms of overfitting.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trusted as automated judges, assisting evaluation and providing reward signals for training other models, particularly in reference-based settings like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, we uncover a critical vulnerability even in this reference-based paradigm: generative reward models are systematically susceptible to reward hacking. We find that superficial inputs, which we term ''master keys'' such as non-word symbols (e.g., '':'' or ''.'') or generic reasoning openers (e.g., ''Thought process:'' or ''Let's solve this problem step by step.''), can consistently elicit false positive rewards without any substantive reasoning. Our systematic evaluation demonstrates this is a widespread failure affecting a diverse range of models, including leading proprietary systems such as GPT-o1 and Claude-4. These results challenge the assumed robustness of LLM judges and pose a significant threat to their reliability. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy using truncated model outputs as adversarial negative examples. The resulting Master Reward Models (Master-RMs) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness against these ''master key'' attacks while maintaining high performance in standard evaluation settings. We supplement these findings with a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerability across model scales, prompt variations, and common inference-time strategies, offering insights to guide future research on robust LLM evaluation. We release our robust, general-domain reward models and the synthetic training data at https://huggingface.co/sarosavo/Master-RM and https://huggingface.co/datasets/sarosavo/Master-RM.

Abstract: Generative models like diffusion and flow-matching create high-fidelity samples by progressively refining noise. The refinement process is notoriously slow, often requiring hundreds of function evaluations. We introduce Warm-Start Diffusion (WSD), a method that uses a simple, deterministic model to dramatically accelerate conditional generation by providing a better starting point. Instead of starting generation from an uninformed $N(\boldsymbol{0}, I)$ prior, our deterministic warm-start model predicts an informed prior $N(\hat{\boldsymbol{\mu}}_C, \text{diag}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}^2_C))$, whose moments are conditioned on the input context $C$. This warm start substantially reduces the distance the generative process must traverse, and therefore the number of diffusion steps required, particularly when the context $C$ is strongly informative. WSD is applicable to any standard diffusion or flow matching algorithm, is orthogonal to and synergistic with other fast sampling techniques like efficient solvers, and is simple to implement. We test WSD in a variety of settings, and find that it substantially outperforms standard diffusion in the efficient sampling regime, generating realistic samples using only 4-6 function evaluations, and saturating performance with 10-12.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a diverse landscape of models, each excelling at different tasks. This diversity drives researchers to employ multiple LLMs in practice, leaving behind valuable multi-LLM log data. This naturally leads to the question of whether such logs can be fully leveraged to fuse LLMs' complementary capabilities. Although prior work has explored various strategies for integrating multiple LLMs, we argue that practical fusion must meet two essential requirements: (1) compatibility with real-world serving scenarios (e.g., local and API-based serving), and (2) flexibility to operate at different stages of the LLM pipeline to meet varied user needs (e.g., fine-tuning and inference stages). To this end, we introduce LLMFusionBench, a large-scale benchmark for LLM fusion that spans 14 tasks across five domains, with responses from 20 open-source LLMs (8B--671B) totaling 103M tokens. Building on LLMFusionBench, we propose FusionFactory, a systematic framework with three elaborated levels: (1) query-level fusion via tailored LLM routers, (2) thought-level fusion leveraging retrieved abstract reasoning templates, and (3) model-level fusion via distillation from top-ranked responses. Experiments show that FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best individual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with the optimal fusion configuration varying across benchmarks, highlighting the promise of multi-LLM log data as a practical foundation for fusing diverse LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph, enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics, highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and interaction data.

Abstract: Scaling general-purpose manipulation to new robot embodiments remains challenging: each platform typically needs large, homogeneous demonstrations, and pixel-to-action VLA pipelines typically degenerate under background and viewpoint shifts. In this paper, we present Vidar, a prior-driven, low-shot adaptation paradigm that replaces most embodiment-specific data with transferable video priors. Vidar consists of an embodied video diffusion model as the generalizable prior and a masked inverse dynamics model (MIDM) adapter based on a key decoupling of the policy. The embodied diffusion model is pre-trained on Internet-scale videos and then domain-adapted to 750K multi-view trajectories from three real-world robot platforms using a unified observation space encoding robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. The MIDM module learns action-relevant pixel masks without dense labels, grounding the prior into the target embodiment's action space while suppressing distractors. Crucially, the generative video prior models the distribution of plausible, temporally coherent interactions, implicitly capturing affordances, contact dynamics, and physical consistency from massive unlabeled video. This shifts the challenge from collecting large amounts of new robot data to efficiently aligning a rich prior with a new embodiment. With only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot (1% of typical data), Vidar outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines and generalizes to unseen tasks, backgrounds, and camera layouts. Our results suggest a scalable recipe for "one prior, many embodiments": strong, inexpensive video priors + minimal on-robot alignment.

Abstract: In reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs), initial errors often propagate and undermine the reliability of the final conclusion. Current LLM-based error detection methods often fail to detect propagated errors because earlier errors can corrupt judgments of downstream reasoning. To better detect such errors, we introduce Autoregressive Reasoning Entailment Stability (ARES), a probabilistic framework that evaluates each reasoning step based solely on previously-verified premises. This inductive method yields a nuanced score for each step and provides certified statistical guarantees of its soundness, rather than a brittle binary label. ARES achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmarks (72.1% Macro-F1, +8.2 points) and demonstrates superior robustness on very long synthetic reasoning chains, where it excels at detecting propagated errors (90.3% F1, +27.6 points).

<title>Learning to summarize user information for personalized reinforcement learning from human feedback</title>

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model, meaning it assumes that everyone's preferences are the same. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn to produce text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. Both the user-summarization model and reward model are trained simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast to the standard Bradley-Terry model, summaries produced by PLUS capture diverse aspects of user preferences, achieving a 11-77% improvement in reward model accuracy. Key strengths of PLUS are: (1) robust performance with new users and conversation topics, achieving a 25% improvement over the best personalized RLHF technique; (2) zero-shot personalization with state-of-the-art proprietary models like GPT-4 (e.g., PLUS-summary-conditioned responses achieved a 72% win rate compared to 28% for default GPT-4o); (3) learning from flexible user contexts beyond preference labels, and (4) interpretable representation of users, enabling greater transparency and user control in pluralistic LLM alignment.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) provides a parameter-efficient approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods rely on task-aware inference and maintain a growing set of task-specific prompts, which introduces two major challenges: (1) severe performance degradation on earlier tasks under task-agnostic inference, and (2) limited scalability due to prompt memory accumulation as task sequences grow. In this paper, we present GRID, a unified framework designed to address these challenges. GRID incorporates a decoding mechanism that enhances backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Furthermore, it employs a gradient-guided prompt selection strategy to compress less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, ensuring scalable and memory-efficient continual learning. Extensive experiments on long-sequence and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID improves average accuracy and backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and substantially reduces prompt memory usage.

Abstract: The pursuit of general-purpose artificial intelligence depends on large language models (LLMs) that can handle both structured reasoning and open-ended generation. We present Omni-Thinker, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that scales LLMs across diverse tasks by combining hybrid rewards with backward-transfer-guided scheduling. Hybrid rewards integrate rule-based verifiable signals with preference-based evaluations from an LLM-as-a-Judge, enabling learning in both deterministic and subjective domains. Our scheduler orders tasks according to accuracy backward transfer (BWT), reducing forgetting and improving multi-task performance. Experiments across four domains show gains of 6.2% over joint training and 12.4% over model merging. Moreover, we demonstrate that simple assumptions on accuracy transfer yield accurate predictions of curriculum outcomes, with entropy dynamics explaining deviations due to generative tasks. These findings underscore the importance of BWT-aware scheduling and hybrid supervision for scaling RL-based post-training toward general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a central problem in time series analysis. However, as the number of channels in time series datasets scales to the thousands or more, a scenario we define as High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting (HDTSF), it introduces significant new modeling challenges that are often not the primary focus of traditional TSF research. HDTSF is challenging because the channel correlation often forms complex and hierarchical patterns. Existing TSF models either ignore these interactions or fail to scale as dimensionality grows. To address this issue, we propose U-Cast, a channel-dependent forecasting architecture that learns latent hierarchical channel structures with an innovative query-based attention. To disentangle highly correlated channel representation, U-Cast adds a full-rank regularization during training. We also release Time-HD, the first benchmark of large, diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Our theory shows that exploiting cross-channel information lowers forecasting risk, and experiments on Time-HD demonstrate that U-Cast surpasses strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. Together, U-Cast and Time-HD provide a solid basis for future HDTSF research.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained prominence in recent years and are now effectively used in a number of applications. However, their performance remains unstable due to the complex landscape of the loss function. To address this issue, we reformulate PINN training as a nonconvex-strongly concave saddle-point problem. After establishing the theoretical foundation for this approach, we conduct an extensive experimental study, evaluating its effectiveness across various tasks and architectures. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs, where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight, adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce Moving Out, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration. The project page is available at https://live-robotics-uva.github.io/movingout_ai/.

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from time-series data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data. We demonstrate our approach on three test cases: the Lorenz system transitioning from non-chaotic to chaotic behaviour, the R\"ossler system moving from chaos to period doubling, and a predator-prey model exhibiting collapse via a global bifurcation.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models achieve remarkable performance, yet a unified theory explaining their internal mechanisms, how training shapes their representations, and enables complex behaviors, remains elusive. We introduce a new analytical framework that models the single-step generation process as a composition of information-processing stages using the language of Markov categories. This compositional perspective provides a unified mathematical language to connect three critical aspects of language modeling that are typically studied in isolation: the training objective, the geometry of the learned representation space, and practical model capabilities. First, our framework provides a precise information-theoretic rationale for the success of multi-token prediction methods like speculative decoding, quantifying the information surplus a model's hidden state contains about tokens beyond the immediate next one. Second, we clarify how the standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective compels the model to learn not just the next word, but also the data's intrinsic conditional uncertainty, a process we formalize using categorical entropy. Our central result shows that, under a linear-softmax head with bounded features, minimizing NLL induces spectral alignment: the learned representation space aligns with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator. This work presents a powerful new lens for understanding how information flows through a model and how the training objective shapes its internal geometry.

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across domains. This variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss. Additionally, UEC employs an uncertainty-aware similarity function that directly incorporates uncertainty into the similarity scoring, providing a theoretically grounded and efficient surrogate to distributional distances. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

Abstract: Discovering scaling laws for predicting model performance at scale is a fundamental and open-ended challenge, mostly reliant on slow, case specific human experimentation. To investigate the potential for LLMs to automate this process, we collect over 5,000 experiments from existing literature and curate seven diverse scaling law discovery tasks. While existing agents struggle to produce accurate law formulas, this paper introduces SLDAgent, an evolution-based agent that co-optimize the scaling law model and the parameters, enabling it to autonomously explore complex relationships between variables. For the first time, we demonstrates that SLDAgent can automatically discover laws that exhibit consistently more accurate extrapolation than their established, human-derived counterparts across all tasks. Through comprehensive analysis, we elucidate why these discovered laws are superior and verify their practical utility in both pretraining and finetuning applications. This work establishes a new paradigm for agentic scientific discovery, showing that AI systems can understand their own scaling behavior, and can contribute novel and practical knowledge back to the research community.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e. the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets. Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy guarantees.

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer~(ST)-based models require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs, thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process, their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol, an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1) a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models (Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and performance for property prediction. We release the code in https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

<title>Beyond Prompt-Induced Lies: Investigating LLM Deception on Benign Prompts</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in reasoning, planning, and decision-making tasks, making their trustworthiness critical. A significant and underexplored risk is intentional deception, where an LLM deliberately fabricates or conceals information to serve a hidden objective. Existing studies typically induce deception by explicitly setting a hidden objective through prompting or fine-tuning, which may not reflect real-world human-LLM interactions. Moving beyond such human-induced deception, we investigate LLMs' self-initiated deception on benign prompts. To address the absence of ground truth, we propose a framework based on Contact Searching Questions~(CSQ). This framework introduces two statistical metrics derived from psychological principles to quantify the likelihood of deception. The first, the Deceptive Intention Score, measures the model's bias toward a hidden objective. The second, the Deceptive Behavior Score, measures the inconsistency between the LLM's internal belief and its expressed output. Evaluating 16 leading LLMs, we find that both metrics rise in parallel and escalate with task difficulty for most models. Moreover, increasing model capacity does not always reduce deception, posing a significant challenge for future LLM development.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models. We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Abstract: With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1) what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect, CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.

Abstract: Deep graph models have achieved great success in network representation learning. However, their focus on pairwise relationships restricts their ability to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this issue, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite the proposal of numerous HNNs, the absence of consistent experimental protocols and multi-dimensional empirical analysis impedes deeper understanding and further development of HNN research. While several toolkits for deep hypergraph learning (DHGL) have been introduced to facilitate algorithm evaluation, they provide only limited quantitative evaluation results and insufficient coverage of advanced algorithms, datasets, and benchmark tasks. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for HNNs. Specifically, DHG-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. We comprehensively evaluate 17 state-of-the-art HNN algorithms on 22 diverse datasets spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, under unified experimental settings. Extensive experiments reveal both the strengths and limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions for future research. Furthermore, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. The DHG-Bench library is available at: https://github.com/Coco-Hut/DHG-Bench.

Abstract: In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations, while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning, despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS, though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations, without relying on an external search algorithm.

<title>Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be procured. We investigate whether example difficulty affects GRPO training effectiveness by comparing selection strategies (easy, medium, hard, random) across multiple models and reasoning tasks. Training on the hardest 10\% of examples (those where the base model fails most often) yields dramatic performance gains up to 47\%, while easy examples produce minimal improvements of 3-15\%. This occurs because GRPO requires outcome variance to generate learning signals; hard examples maintain mixed success/failure outcomes throughout training while easy examples quickly converge to consistent success, eliminating learning opportunities. Moreover, models trained on hard examples show superior out-of-distribution generalization, with only hard-trained models achieving meaningful gains on the AIME2025 benchmark. Our findings provide clear guidance: when budget-constrained, prioritize collecting and annotating examples where your base model struggles, as these drive nearly all learning value in GRPO fine-tuning

<title>Double Check My Desired Return: Transformer with Target Alignment for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task, enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target alignment for Offline RL. Doctor integrates the strengths of supervised learning (SL) and temporal difference (TD) learning by jointly optimizing the action prediction and value estimation. During inference, Doctor introduces a double-check mechanism: actions are first sampled around the desired target returns and then validated with value functions. This ensures more accurate alignment between predicted actions and desired target returns. We evaluate Doctor on the D4RL and EpiCare benchmarks, demonstrating aligned control yields stronger performance and tunable expertise, showing its effectiveness in a wide range of tasks.

Abstract: Transformer architectures, and their attention mechanisms in particular, form the foundation of modern large language models. While transformer models are widely believed to operate in high-dimensional hidden spaces, we show that attention outputs are confined to a surprisingly low-dimensional subspace, where about 60\% of the directions account for 99\% of the variance--a phenomenon that is consistently observed across diverse model families and datasets, and is induced by the attention output projection matrix. Critically, we find this low-rank structure as a key factor of the prevalent dead feature problem in sparse dictionary learning, where it creates a mismatch between randomly initialized features and the intrinsic geometry of the activation space. Building on this insight, we propose a subspace-constrained training method for sparse autoencoders (SAEs), initializing feature directions into the active subspace of activations. Our approach reduces dead features from 87\% to below 1\% in Attention Output SAEs with 1M features, and can further extend to other sparse dictionary learning methods. Our findings provide both new insights into the geometry of attention and practical tools for improving sparse dictionary learning in large language models.

Abstract: The chart-to-code generation task requires MLLMs to convert chart images into executable code. This task faces two main challenges: limited data diversity and the difficulty of maintaining visual consistency between generated charts and the original ones. Existing datasets mainly rely on synthetic seed data to prompt GPT models for code generation, resulting in homogeneous samples that limit model generalization to real-world chart styles. To address this, we propose ReChartPrompt, leveraging real-world, human-designed charts extracted from arXiv papers as prompts. By harnessing the rich content and diverse visual styles of arXiv charts, we construct ReChartPrompt-240K, a large-scale and highly diverse dataset that better reflects realistic chart variations. For the second challenge, although SFT improves code understanding by optimizing next-token prediction, it does not provide direct supervision on visual features. As a result, it often fails to guarantee that the generated charts visually match the original ones. To address this, we propose ChartSimRL, a GRPO-based reinforcement learning algorithm guided by a novel chart similarity reward. This reward consists of two components: attribute similarity, which measures the overlap of chart attributes like layout and color between the generated and original charts, and visual similarity, which evaluates overall visual features, including texture, using convolutional neural networks. Unlike traditional text-based rewards, our reward accounts for the multimodal nature of the chart-to-code generation task, significantly enhancing the model's ability to accurately reproduce charts. Integrating ReChartPrompt and ChartSimRL, we develop the ChartMaster model, achieving SOTA results among 7B-parameter models and rivaling GPT-4o on various chart-to-code benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning large models has become increasingly resource intensive and may have difficulty ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.

Abstract: Reliably composing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, multi-step workflows remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm -- optimizing discrete prompts in a pipeline -- is notoriously brittle and struggles to enforce the formal compliance required for structured tasks. We introduce Type-Compliant Adaptation Cascades (TACs), a framework that recasts workflow adaptation as learning typed probabilistic programs. TACs treat the entire workflow, which is composed of parameter-efficiently adapted LLMs and deterministic logic, as an unnormalized joint distribution. This enables principled, gradient-based training even with latent intermediate structures. We provide theoretical justification for our tractable optimization objective, proving that the optimization bias vanishes as the model learns type compliance. Empirically, TACs significantly outperform state-of-the-art prompt-optimization baselines. Gains are particularly pronounced on structured tasks, improving FinQA from $12.0\%$ to $24.7\%$ for a Qwen 3 8B model, MGSM-SymPy from $57.1\%$ to $75.9\%$ for a Gemma 2 27B model, MGSM from $1.6\%$ to $27.3\%$, and MuSR from $36.5\%$ to $62.6\%$ for a Gemma 7B model. TACs offer a robust and theoretically grounded paradigm for developing reliable, task-compliant LLM systems.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely studied due to its efficiency. However, existing PTQ methods are limited by their inability to fine-tune model parameters and often suffer significant accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios. Quantization-aware training (QAT) provides a more principled solution, but its reliance on backpropagation incurs prohibitive memory costs, limiting its practicality for LLM deployment. To address these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT framework that supports both weight and activation quantization. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate backpropagation, substantially reducing computational and memory overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. We further introduce a lightweight variant of ZeroQAT for quantized fine-tuning, which freezes and pre-quantizes most parameters to further cut memory usage. Experiments show that ZeroQAT consistently outperforms representative PTQ and QAT baselines while requiring significantly less memory. For example, ZeroQAT enables fine-tuning of a 13B model at extremely low bit-widths (e.g., 2-4 bits) on a single 8GB GPU, and even allows fine-tuning a 6.7B model on a OnePlus 12 smartphone, demonstrating its practicality for end-to-end QAT on resource-limited edge devices.

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this work, we propose a novel network architecture that enables LoD signal representation. Our approach builds on a modified Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single scale and thus lacks native LoD support. Specifically, we introduce the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP), which extends the MLP by attaching an output branch, also called tail, to each hidden layer. Each tail refines the residual between the current prediction and the ground-truth signal, so that the accumulated outputs across layers correspond to the target signals at different LoDs, enabling multi-scale modeling with supervision from only a single-resolution signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our T-MLP outperforms existing neural LoD baselines across diverse signal representation tasks.

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropy in the singular value spectra of parameters, activations, and gradients as the fundamental barrier to low-bit training of large language models (LLMs). These spectra are dominated by a small fraction of large singular values, inducing wide numerical ranges that cause quantization bias and severe spectral distortion, ultimately degrading training performance. This work presents Metis, a spectral-domain quantization framework that partitions anisotropic spectra into narrower sub-distributions for independent quantization, thereby reducing errors and preserving spectral structure. To minimize overhead, Metis leverages two key properties of the dominant spectral subspace: preservation via sparsely random sampling and preservation via random projection, reducing decomposition cost to a negligible level. On LLaMA-3 8B trained with 100B tokens, Metis enables robust W4A4G4 training with FP4 quantization of weights, activations, and gradients, yielding only a 0.4% training loss gap and a 0.1% degradation in downstream accuracy relative to BF16. Beyond matching BF16 fidelity, Metis also surpasses our implementation of Nvidia's recently announced (yet to be publicly released) FP4 recipe, consistently achieving lower loss and higher downstream accuracy while incurring significantly lower computational overhead. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Metis-quantization-644B.

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose \textit{GradES}, a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning for both language and vision-language models. \textit{GradES} tracks the magnitude of gradient changes in backpropagation for these matrices during training. When a projection matrix's magnitude of gradient changes fall below a convergence threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow converging matrices to continue learning. \textit{GradES} speeds up training time by 1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2\% higher average accuracy in language tasks and 3.88\% on multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$ between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and texture synthesis illustrate the versatility of the proposed approach in different settings.

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose intelligent agents is intrinsically linked to the environments in which they are trained. While scaling models and datasets has yielded remarkable capabilities, scaling the complexity, diversity, and interactivity of environments remains a crucial bottleneck. Hand-crafted environments are finite and often contain implicit biases, limiting the potential for agents to develop truly generalizable and robust skills. In this work, we propose a paradigm for generating a boundless and adaptive curriculum of challenges by framing the environment generation process as an adversarial game. We introduce a system where a team of cooperative multi-agent defenders learns to survive against a procedurally generative attacker. The attacker agent learns to produce increasingly challenging configurations of enemy units, dynamically creating novel worlds tailored to exploit the defenders' current weaknesses. Concurrently, the defender team learns cooperative strategies to overcome these generated threats. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates a self-scaling environment where complexity arises organically from the adversarial interaction, providing an effectively infinite stream of novel and relevant training data. We demonstrate that with minimal training, this approach leads to the emergence of complex, intelligent behaviors, such as flanking and shielding by the attacker, and focus-fire and spreading by the defenders. Our findings suggest that adversarial co-evolution is a powerful mechanism for automatically scaling environmental complexity, driving agents towards greater robustness and strategic depth.

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes LLMs' internal computations remain unclear. We study lightweight steering vectors inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a reinforcement-learning objective. These vectors match full fine-tuning performance while preserving the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using logit-lens readouts and path-patching analyses on two models, we find that (i) the last-layer steering vector acts like a token-substitution bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens such as "To" and "Step"; (ii) the penultimate-layer vector leaves attention patterns largely intact and instead operates through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols; and (iii) middle layers de-emphasize non-English tokens. Next, we show that a SAE isolates features associated with correct generations. We also show that steering vectors (i) transfer to other models, (ii) combine across layers when trained in isolation, and (iii) concentrate magnitude on meaningful prompt segments under adaptive token-wise scaling. Taken together, these results deepen understanding of how trained steering vectors shape computation and should inform future work in activation engineering and the study of reasoning models.

Abstract: Controllable molecular graph generation is essential for material and drug discovery, where generated molecules must satisfy diverse property constraints. While recent advances in graph diffusion models have improved generation quality, their effectiveness in multi-conditional settings remains limited due to reliance on joint conditioning or continuous relaxations that compromise fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose Composable Score-based Graph Diffusion model (CSGD), the first model that extends score matching to discrete graphs via concrete scores, enabling flexible and principled manipulation of conditional guidance. Building on this foundation, we introduce two score-based techniques: Composable Guidance (CoG), which allows fine-grained control over arbitrary subsets of conditions during sampling, and Probability Calibration (PC), which adjusts estimated transition probabilities to mitigate train-test mismatches. Empirical results on four molecular datasets show that CSGD achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 15.3% average improvement in controllability over prior methods, while maintaining high validity and distributional fidelity. Our findings highlight the practical advantages of score-based modeling for discrete graph generation and its capacity for flexible, multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Graph alignment, the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across multiple graphs, is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios. Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language representations.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness through personalized intervention strategies.

Abstract: Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences (TD) for training-time reinforcement learning and inference-time verification. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies in 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

<title>The Multi-Query Paradox in Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a powerful framework for problems where explicit gradients are unavailable and have to be approximated using only queries to function value. The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but suffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to improves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off: under a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the total number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one another. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored question.
  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze two aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new Projection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate minimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the dependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex, non-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg, we prove that using more than one query per iteration is always query-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the contrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration, resulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work clarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an intermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated entirely by the aggregation method used. These theoretical findings are also consistently validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Auto-bidding serves as a critical tool for advertisers to improve their advertising performance. Recent progress has demonstrated that AI-Generated Bidding (AIGB), which learns a conditional generative planner from offline data, achieves superior performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning (RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still face a performance bottleneck due to their inherent inability to explore beyond the static offline dataset. To address this, we propose {AIGB-Pearl} (\emph{{P}lanning with {E}valu{A}tor via RL}), a novel method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The core of AIGB-Pearl lies in constructing a trajectory evaluator for scoring generation quality and designing a provably sound KL-Lipschitz-constrained score maximization scheme to ensure safe and efficient generalization beyond the offline dataset. A practical algorithm incorporating the synchronous coupling technique is further devised to ensure the model regularity required by the proposed scheme. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

Abstract: The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected materials is a key challenge in planetary defense and in the pursuit of inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating-phenomena that strongly influence asteroid deflection or fusion ignition has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields-pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM captures nonlinear shock-driven dynamics across porous and architected configurations, achieving mean errors of 1.4% and 3.2% respectively, all while delivering over three orders of magnitude in speedup. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation and inertial fusion energy.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits, and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110 instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories. The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded to support future research in VQE optimization.

Abstract: World models have shown potential in artificial intelligence by predicting and reasoning about world states beyond direct observations. However, existing approaches are predominantly evaluated in synthetic environments or constrained scene settings, limiting their validation in real-world contexts with broad spatial coverage and complex semantics. Meanwhile, remote sensing applications urgently require spatial reasoning capabilities for disaster response and urban planning. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing the first framework for world modeling in remote sensing. We formulate remote sensing world modeling as direction-conditioned spatial extrapolation, where models generate semantically consistent adjacent image tiles given a central observation and directional instruction. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop RSWISE (Remote Sensing World-Image Spatial Evaluation), a benchmark containing 1,600 evaluation tasks across four scenarios: general, flood, urban, and rural. RSWISE combines visual fidelity assessment with instruction compliance evaluation using GPT-4o as a semantic judge, ensuring models genuinely perform spatial reasoning rather than simple replication. Afterwards, we present RemoteBAGEL, a unified multimodal model fine-tuned on remote sensing data for spatial extrapolation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RemoteBAGEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RSWISE.

Abstract: Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy. Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves predictions on four tasks and five datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs, attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods, their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.

Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial structures that improve on known limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically, we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional) lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI in developing proofs.

Abstract: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening generalization.We propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting self-evolution.Extensive experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.

Abstract: Tasks on complex systems require high-precision numerical computation to support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot integrate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with existing architectures. Multi-agent approaches can leverage external experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from inefficiency caused by limited scalability. To this end, we propose Physically-isolated Experts Routing Network (PiERN), an architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of the tool-use workflows or function-calling, PiERN endogenously integrates computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiERN on representative linear and nonlinear computation-reasoning tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent system approaches. Results show that the PiERN architecture achieves not only higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiERN offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable paradigm for interfacing language models with scientific systems.

Abstract: Protein folding models have achieved groundbreaking results typically via a combination of integrating domain knowledge into the architectural blocks and training pipelines. Nonetheless, given the success of generative models across different but related problems, it is natural to question whether these architectural designs are a necessary condition to build performant models. In this paper, we introduce SimpleFold, the first flow-matching based protein folding model that solely uses general purpose transformer blocks. Protein folding models typically employ computationally expensive modules involving triangular updates, explicit pair representations or multiple training objectives curated for this specific domain. Instead, SimpleFold employs standard transformer blocks with adaptive layers and is trained via a generative flow-matching objective with an additional structural term. We scale SimpleFold to 3B parameters and train it on approximately 9M distilled protein structures together with experimental PDB data. On standard folding benchmarks, SimpleFold-3B achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, in addition SimpleFold demonstrates strong performance in ensemble prediction which is typically difficult for models trained via deterministic reconstruction objectives. Due to its general-purpose architecture, SimpleFold shows efficiency in deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware. SimpleFold challenges the reliance on complex domain-specific architectures designs in protein folding, opening up an alternative design space for future progress.

<title>APRIL: Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning to Tame Long-tail Generation</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone in advancing large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by 22.5% on average (at most 44%) across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves 2.1% on average(at most 8%) higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.

Abstract: A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs) that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for slightly autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent crossmapping -- but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning. They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.

arXiv:2210.12860v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze several inexact regularized Newton-type methods for finding a global saddle point of \emph{convex-concave} unconstrained min-max optimization problems. Compared to first-order methods, our understanding of second-order methods for min-max optimization is relatively limited, as obtaining global rates of convergence with second-order information can be much more involved. In this paper, we examine how second-order information is used to speed up extra-gradient methods, even under inexactness. In particular, we show that the proposed methods generate iterates that remain within a bounded set and that the averaged iterates converge to an $\epsilon$-saddle point within $O(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ iterations in terms of a restricted gap function. We also provide a simple routine for solving the subproblem at each iteration, requiring a single Schur decomposition and $O(\log\log(1/\epsilon))$ calls to a linear system solver in a quasi-upper-triangular system. Thus, our method improves the existing line-search-based second-order min-max optimization methods by shaving off an $O(\log\log(1/\epsilon))$ factor in the required number of Schur decompositions. Finally, we conduct experiments on synthetic and real data to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

<title>Policy Gradient Algorithms for Robust MDPs with Non-Rectangular Uncertainty Sets</title>

Abstract: We propose policy gradient algorithms for robust infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) with non-rectangular uncertainty sets, thereby addressing an open challenge in the robust MDP literature. Indeed, uncertainty sets that display statistical optimality properties and make optimal use of limited data often fail to be rectangular. Unfortunately, the corresponding robust MDPs cannot be solved with dynamic programming techniques and are in fact provably intractable. We first present a randomized projected Langevin dynamics algorithm that solves the robust policy evaluation problem to global optimality but is inefficient. We also propose a deterministic policy gradient method that is efficient but solves the robust policy evaluation problem only approximately, and we prove that the approximation error scales with a new measure of non-rectangularity of the uncertainty set. Finally, we describe an actor-critic algorithm that finds an $\epsilon$-optimal solution for the robust policy improvement problem in $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations. We thus present the first complete solution scheme for robust MDPs with non-rectangular uncertainty sets offering global optimality guarantees. Numerical experiments show that our algorithms compare favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Experimental and observational studies often lack validity due to untestable assumptions. We propose a double machine learning approach to combine experimental and observational studies, allowing practitioners to test for assumption violations and estimate treatment effects consistently. Our framework proposes a falsification test for external validity and ignorability under milder assumptions. We provide consistent treatment effect estimators even when one of the assumptions is violated. However, our no-free-lunch theorem highlights the necessity of accurately identifying the violated assumption for consistent treatment effect estimation. Through comparative analyses, we show our framework's superiority over existing data fusion methods. The practical utility of our approach is further exemplified by three real-world case studies, underscoring its potential for widespread application in empirical research.

Abstract: This study proposes a few-shot personalized saliency prediction method that leverages interpersonal gaze patterns. Unlike general saliency maps, personalized saliency maps (PSMs) capture individual visual attention and provide insights into individual visual preferences. However, predicting PSMs is challenging because of the complexity of gaze patterns and the difficulty of collecting extensive eye-tracking data from individuals. An effective strategy for predicting PSMs from limited data is the use of eye-tracking data from other persons. To efficiently handle the PSMs of other persons, this study focuses on the selection of images to acquire eye-tracking data and the preservation of the structural information of PSMs. In the proposed method, these images are selected such that they bring more diverse gaze patterns to persons, and structural information is preserved using tensor-based regression. The experimental results demonstrate that these two factors are beneficial for few-shot PSM prediction.

Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.

Abstract: Decentralized optimization methods with local updates have recently gained attention for their provable ability to communication acceleration. In these methods, nodes perform several iterations of local computations between the communication rounds. Nevertheless, this capability is effective only when the network is sufficiently well-connected and the loss function is smooth. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient method MG-Skip with probabilistic local updates and multi-gossip communications for decentralized composite (smooth + nonsmooth) optimization, whose stepsize is independent of the number of local updates and the network topology. For any undirected and connected networks, MG-Skip allows for the multi-gossip communications to be skipped in most iterations in the strongly convex setting, while its computation complexity is $\mathcal{O}\left(\kappa \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ and communication complexity is only $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\kappa}{(1-\rho)}} \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the loss function, $\rho$ reflects the connectivity of the network topology, and $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy. The theoretical results indicate that MG-Skip achieves provable communication acceleration, thereby validating the advantages of local updates in the nonsmooth setting.

Abstract: Current methods to identify and classify racist language in text rely on small-n qualitative approaches or large-n approaches focusing exclusively on overt forms of racist discourse. This article provides a step-by-step generalizable guideline to identify and classify different forms of racist discourse in large corpora. In our approach, we start by conceptualizing racism and its different manifestations. We then contextualize these racist manifestations to the time and place of interest, which allows researchers to identify their discursive form. Finally, we apply XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R), a cross-lingual model for supervised text classification with a cutting-edge contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying racism in large corpora. We illustrate our approach using a corpus of tweets relating to the Ecuadorian ind\'igena community between 2018 and 2021.

<title>Off-Policy Evaluation in Markov Decision Processes under Weak Distributional Overlap</title>

Abstract: Doubly robust methods hold considerable promise for off-policy evaluation in Markov decision processes (MDPs) under sequential ignorability: They have been shown to converge as $1/\sqrt{T}$ with the horizon $T$, to be statistically efficient in large samples, and to allow for modular implementation where preliminary estimation tasks can be executed using standard reinforcement learning techniques. Existing results, however, make heavy use of a strong distributional overlap assumption whereby the stationary distributions of the target policy and the data-collection policy are within a bounded factor of each other -- and this assumption is typically only credible when the state space of the MDP is bounded. In this paper, we re-visit the task of off-policy evaluation in MDPs under a weaker notion of distributional overlap, and introduce a class of truncated doubly robust (TDR) estimators which we find to perform well in this setting. When the distribution ratio of the target and data-collection policies is square-integrable (but not necessarily bounded), our approach recovers the large-sample behavior previously established under strong distributional overlap. When this ratio is not square-integrable, TDR is still consistent but with a slower-than-$1/\sqrt{T}$-rate; furthermore, this rate of convergence is minimax over a class of MDPs defined only using mixing conditions. We validate our approach numerically and find that, in our experiments, appropriate truncation plays a major role in enabling accurate off-policy evaluation when strong distributional overlap does not hold.

Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://embodied-read.github.io

Abstract: When two players are engaged in a repeated game with unknown payoff matrices, they may use single-agent multi-armed bandit algorithms to choose the actions independent of each other. We show that when the players use Thompson sampling, the game dynamics converges to the Nash equilibrium under a mild assumption on the payoff matrices. Therefore, algorithmic collusion doesn't arise in this case despite the fact that the players do not intentionally deploy competitive strategies. To prove the convergence result, we find that the framework developed in stochastic approximation doesn't apply, because of the sporadic and infrequent updates of the inferior actions and the lack of Lipschitz continuity. We develop a novel sample-path-wise approach to show the convergence. However, when the payoff matrices do not satisfy the assumption, the game may converge to collusive outcomes.

Abstract: This work introduces the Supervised Expectation-Maximization Framework (SEMF), a versatile and model-agnostic approach for generating prediction intervals with any ML model. SEMF extends the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, traditionally used in unsupervised learning, to a supervised context, leveraging latent variable modeling for uncertainty estimation. Through extensive empirical evaluation of diverse simulated distributions and 11 real-world tabular datasets, SEMF consistently produces narrower prediction intervals while maintaining the desired coverage probability, outperforming traditional quantile regression methods. Furthermore, without using the quantile (pinball) loss, SEMF allows point predictors, including gradient-boosted trees and neural networks, to be calibrated with conformal quantile regression. The results indicate that SEMF enhances uncertainty quantification under diverse data distributions and is particularly effective for models that otherwise struggle with inherent uncertainty representation.

Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.

Abstract: The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.

Abstract: We present fVDB, a novel GPU-optimized framework for deep learning on large-scale 3D data. fVDB provides a complete set of differentiable primitives to build deep learning architectures for common tasks in 3D learning such as convolution, pooling, attention, ray-tracing, meshing, etc.
  fVDB simultaneously provides a much larger feature set (primitives and operators) than established frameworks with no loss in efficiency: our operators match or exceed the performance of other frameworks with narrower scope. Furthermore, fVDB can process datasets with much larger footprint and spatial resolution than prior works, while providing a competitive memory footprint on small inputs. To achieve this combination of versatility and performance, fVDB relies on a single novel VDB index grid acceleration structure paired with several key innovations including GPU accelerated sparse grid construction, convolution using tensorcores, fast ray tracing kernels using a Hierarchical Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm (HDDA), and jagged tensors.
  Our framework is fully integrated with PyTorch enabling interoperability with existing pipelines, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of representative tasks such as large-scale point-cloud segmentation, high resolution 3D generative modeling, unbounded scale Neural Radiance Fields, and large-scale point cloud reconstruction.

Abstract: This work explores multi-modal inference in a high-dimensional simplified model, analytically quantifying the performance gain of multi-modal inference over that of analyzing modalities in isolation. We present the Bayes-optimal performance and recovery thresholds in a model where the objective is to recover the latent structures from two noisy data matrices with correlated spikes. The paper derives the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for this model and characterizes its performance in the high-dimensional limit via the associated state evolution. The analysis holds for a broad range of priors and noise channels, which can differ across modalities. The linearization of AMP is compared numerically to the widely used partial least squares (PLS) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods, which are both observed to suffer from a sub-optimal recovery threshold.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DiscoGP, a novel framework for extracting self-contained modular units, or sheaves, within neural language models (LMs). Sheaves extend the concept of functional circuits, a unit widely explored in interpretability research, by considering not only subsets of edges in an LM's computation graph but also the model's weight parameters. Our framework identifies sheaves through a gradient-based pruning algorithm that operates on both of these in such a way that reduces the original LM to a sparse skeleton that preserves certain core capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that, across a range of linguistic and reasoning tasks, DiscoGP extracts sheaves that preserve 93%-100% of a model's performance on the identified task while comprising only 1%-7% of the original weights and connections. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that, compared to previously identified LM circuits, the sheaves discovered by DiscoGP exhibit superior modularity and functional fidelity. Extending our method to the neuron level also unveils novel insights into the inner workings of LLMs

Abstract: Change points in real-world systems mark significant regime shifts in system dynamics, possibly triggered by exogenous or endogenous factors. These points define regimes for the time evolution of the system and are crucial for understanding transitions in financial, economic, social, environmental, and technological contexts. Building upon the Bayesian approach introduced in \cite{c:07}, we devise a new method for online change point detection in the mean of a univariate time series, which is well suited for real-time applications and is able to handle the general temporal patterns displayed by data in many empirical contexts. We first describe time series as an autoregressive process of an arbitrary order. Second, the variance and correlation of the data are allowed to vary within each regime driven by a scoring rule that updates the value of the parameters for a better fit of the observations. Finally, a change point is detected in a probabilistic framework via the posterior distribution of the current regime length. By modeling temporal dependencies and time-varying parameters, the proposed approach enhances both the estimate accuracy and the forecasting power. Empirical validations using various datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in capturing memory and dynamic patterns, offering deeper insights into the non-stationary dynamics of real-world systems.

Abstract: We propose an approach for preventing unsafe or otherwise low-quality large language model (LLM) outputs by leveraging the stochasticity of LLMs, an approach we call Repeated Checking with Regeneration (RCR). In this system, LLM checkers vote on the acceptability of a generated output, regenerating it if a threshold of disapproval is reached, until sufficient checkers approve. Based on our estimators for cost and failure rate and experimental data tailored to the application, our algorithm achieves a desired expected failure rate at Pareto-optimal cost. The failure rate provably decreases exponentially as a function of cost, and the models reasonably estimate the actual performance of such a system in action, even with limited data. This approach does not depend on the language model used, and could allow cheap, small LLMs to control, constrain, or at some tasks even outperform very complex and costly ones.

Abstract: Efficient navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for autonomous robots interacting with moving agents and static obstacles. We present a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that improves robot navigation and interaction with different types of agents and obstacles based on specific safety requirements. Our approach uses information about the entity types, improving collision avoidance and ensuring safer navigation. We introduce a new reward function that penalizes the robot for being close to or colliding with different entities such as adults, bicyclists, children, and static obstacles, while also encouraging the robot's progress toward the goal. We propose an optimized algorithm that significantly accelerates the training, validation, and testing phases, enabling efficient learning in complex environments. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art navigation and collision avoidance methods.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.

<title>Attentive Dilated Convolution for Automatic Sleep Staging using Force-directed Layout</title>

Abstract: Sleep stages play an important role in identifying sleep patterns and diagnosing sleep disorders. In this study, we present an automated sleep stage classifier called the Attentive Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (AttDiCNN), which uses deep learning methodologies to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, computational complexity, and reliable and automatic sleep staging. We employed a force-directed layout based on the visibility graph to capture the most significant information from the EEG signals, thereby representing the spatial-temporal features. The proposed network consists of three modules: the Localized Spatial Feature Extraction Network (LSFE), Spatio-Temporal-Temporal Long Retention Network (S2TLR), and Global Averaging Attention Network (G2A). The LSFE captures spatial information from sleep data, the S2TLR is designed to extract the most pertinent information in long-term contexts, and the G2A reduces computational overhead by aggregating information from the LSFE and S2TLR. We evaluated the performance of our model on three comprehensive and publicly accessible datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.56%, 99.66%, and 99.08% for the EDFX, HMC, and NCH datasets, respectively, while maintaining a low computational complexity with 1.4 M parameters. Our proposed architecture surpasses existing methodologies in several performance metrics, thereby proving its potential as an automated tool for clinical settings.

Abstract: The design (shape) of a robot is usually decided before the control is implemented. This might limit how well the design is adapted to a task, as the suitability of the design is given by how well the robot performs in the task, which requires both a design and a controller. The co-optimization or simultaneous optimization of the design and control of robots addresses this limitation by producing a design and control that are both adapted to the task. This paper investigates some of the challenges inherent in the co-optimization of design and control in simulation. The results show that reducing how well the controllers are trained during the co-optimization process significantly improves the robot's performance when considering a second phase in which the controller for the best design is retrained with additional resources. In addition, the results demonstrate that the computation budget allocated to training the controller for each design influences design complexity, with simpler designs associated with lower training budgets. This paper experimentally studies key questions discussed in other works in the literature on the co-optimization of design and control of robots in simulation in four different co-optimization problems.

Abstract: We study the problem of system identification for stochastic continuous-time dynamics, based on a single finite-length state trajectory. We present a method for estimating the possibly unstable open-loop matrix by employing properly randomized control inputs. Then, we establish theoretical performance guarantees showing that the estimation error decays with trajectory length, a measure of excitability, and the signal-to-noise ratio, while it grows with dimension. Numerical illustrations that showcase the rates of learning the dynamics, will be provided as well. To perform the theoretical analysis, we develop new technical tools that are of independent interest. That includes non-asymptotic stochastic bounds for highly non-stationary martingales and generalized laws of iterated logarithms, among others.

Abstract: This paper explains a neural network for image generation from a new perspective, i.e., explaining representation structures for image generation. We propose a set of desirable properties to define the representation structure of a neural network for image generation, including feature completeness, spatial boundedness and consistency. These properties enable us to propose a method for disentangling primitive feature components from the intermediate-layer features, where each feature component generates a primitive regional pattern covering multiple image patches. In this way, the generation of the entire image can be explained as a superposition of these feature components. We prove that these feature components, which satisfy the feature completeness property and the linear additivity property (derived from the feature completeness, spatial boundedness, and consistency properties), can be computed as OR Harsanyi interaction. Experiments have verified the faithfulness of the disentangled primitive regional patterns.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL), a supervised learning technique that relies on adding annotated examples to the model context. We investigate a contextual bandit version of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL), where models learn in-context, online, from external reward, instead of supervised data. We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends. Our findings highlight ICRL capabilities in LLMs, while also underscoring fundamental limitations in their implicit reasoning about errors.

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem is one of the most important results in stochastic optimization, where it is widely used to prove the convergence of stochastic algorithms. We provide a quantitative version of the theorem, establishing a bound on how far one needs to look in order to locate a region of \emph{metastability} in the sense of Tao. Our proof involves a metastable analogue of Doob's theorem for $L_1$-supermartingales along with a series of technical lemmas that make precise how quantitative information propagates through sums and products of stochastic processes. In this way, our paper establishes a general methodology for finding metastable bounds for stochastic processes that can be reduced to supermartingales, and therefore for obtaining quantitative convergence information across a broad class of stochastic algorithms whose convergence proof relies on some variation of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We conclude by discussing how our general quantitative result might be used in practice.

Abstract: Autonomous agents often face the challenge of interpreting uncertain natural language instructions for planning tasks. Representing these instructions as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) enables planners to synthesize actionable plans. We introduce CoT-TL, a data-efficient in-context learning framework for translating natural language specifications into LTL representations. CoT-TL addresses the limitations of large language models, which typically rely on extensive fine-tuning data, by extending chain-of-thought reasoning and semantic roles to align with the requirements of formal logic creation. This approach enhances the transparency and rationale behind LTL generation, fostering user trust. CoT-TL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across three diverse datasets in low-data scenarios, outperforming existing methods without fine-tuning or intermediate translations. To improve reliability and minimize hallucinations, we incorporate model checking to validate the syntax of the generated LTL output. We further demonstrate CoT-TL's effectiveness through ablation studies and evaluations on unseen LTL structures and formulas in a new dataset. Finally, we validate CoT-TL's practicality by integrating it into a QuadCopter for multi-step drone planning based on natural language instructions.

Abstract: Climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for climate emulation tasks. Here, we propose PACER, a lightweight 684K parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator. PACER emulates temperature and precipitation stably for 86 years while only being trained on greenhouse gas emissions data. We incorporate a fundamental physical law of advection-diffusion in PACER accounting for boundary conditions and empirically estimating the diffusion co-efficient and flow velocities from emissions data. PACER has been trained on 15 climate models provided by ClimateSet outperforming baselines across most of the climate models and advancing a new state of the art in a climate diagnostic task.

arXiv:2411.01076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployed large language models (LLMs) often rely on speculative decoding, a technique that generates and verifies multiple candidate tokens in parallel, to improve throughput and latency. In this work, we reveal a new side-channel whereby input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect speculations can be inferred by monitoring per-iteration token counts or packet sizes.We demonstrate that an adversary observing these patterns can fingerprint user queries with >90% accuracy across four speculative-decoding schemes, REST (100\%), LADE (up to 92%), BiLD (up to 95%), and EAGLE (up to 77.6%) and leak confidential datastore contents used for prediction at rates exceeding 25 tokens/sec. We evaluate the side-channel attacks in both research prototypes as well as the production-grade vLLM serving framework. To defend against these, we propose and evaluate a suite of mitigations, including packet padding and iteration-wise token aggregation.

Abstract: Building a universal trajectory foundation model is a promising solution to address the limitations of existing trajectory modeling approaches, such as task specificity, regional dependency, and data sensitivity. Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.

Abstract: We propose a novel Auto-Regressive (AR) image generation approach that models images as hierarchical compositions of interpretable visual layers. While AR models have achieved transformative success in language modeling, replicating this success in vision tasks has presented unique challenges due to inherent spatial dependencies in images. Addressing the unique challenges of vision tasks, our method (CART) adds image details iteratively via semantically meaningful decompositions. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of CART by applying it across three distinct decomposition strategies: (i) Base-Detail Decomposition (Mumford-Shah smoothness), (ii) Intrinsic Decomposition (albedo/shading), and (iii) Specularity Decomposition (diffuse/specular). This "next-detail" strategy outperforms traditional "next-token" and "next-scale" approaches, improving controllability, semantic interpretability, and resolution scalability. Experiments show CART generates visually compelling results while enabling structured image manipulation, opening new directions for controllable generative modeling via physically or perceptually motivated image factorization.

Abstract: Working with systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) is a fundamental task in computational science. Well-posed systems are addressed by numerical solvers or neural operators, whereas systems described by data are often addressed by PINNs or Gaussian processes. In this work, we propose Boundary Ehrenpreis--Palamodov Gaussian Processes (B-EPGPs), a novel probabilistic framework for constructing GP priors that satisfy both general systems of linear PDEs with constant coefficients and linear boundary conditions and can be conditioned on a finite data set. We explicitly construct GP priors for representative PDE systems with practical boundary conditions. Formal proofs of correctness are provided and empirical results demonstrating significant accuracy and computational resource improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The recent breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing has sparked exploration in recommendation systems, however, their limited domain-specific knowledge remains a critical bottleneck. Specifically, LLMs lack key pieces of information crucial for sequential recommendations, such as user behavior patterns. To address this critical gap, we propose IDLE-Adapter, a novel framework that integrates pre-trained ID embeddings, rich in domain-specific knowledge, into LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy. IDLE-Adapter acts as a bridge, transforming sparse user-item interaction data into dense, LLM-compatible representations through a Pre-trained ID Sequential Model, Dimensionality Alignment, Layer-wise Embedding Refinement, and Layer-wise Distribution Alignment. Furthermore, IDLE-Adapter demonstrates remarkable flexibility by seamlessly integrating ID embeddings from diverse ID-based sequential models and LLM architectures. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of IDLE-Adapter, achieving over 10\% and 20\% improvements in HitRate@5 and NDCG@5 metrics, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: While invariant measures are widely employed to analyze physical systems when a direct study of pointwise trajectories is intractable, e.g., due to chaos or noise, they cannot uniquely identify the underlying dynamics. Our first result shows that, in contrast to invariant measures in state coordinates, e.g., $[x(t), y(t), z(t)]$, the invariant measure expressed in time-delay coordinates, e.g., $[x(t), x(t-\tau),\ldots, x(t-(m-1)\tau)]$, can identify the dynamics up to a topological conjugacy. Our second result resolves the remaining ambiguity: by combining invariant measures constructed from multiple delay frames with distinct observables, the system is uniquely identifiable, provided that a suitable initial condition is satisfied. These guarantees require informative observables and appropriate delay parameters ($m,\tau$), which can be limiting in certain settings. We support our theoretical contributions through a series of physical examples demonstrating how invariant measures expressed in delay-coordinates can be used to perform robust system identification in practice.

<title>A learning-based approach to stochastic optimal control under reach-avoid constraint</title>

Abstract: We develop a model-free approach to optimally control stochastic, Markovian systems subject to a reach-avoid constraint. Specifically, the state trajectory must remain within a safe set while reaching a target set within a finite time horizon. Due to the time-dependent nature of these constraints, we show that, in general, the optimal policy for this constrained stochastic control problem is non-Markovian, which increases the computational complexity. To address this challenge, we apply the state-augmentation technique from arXiv:2402.19360, reformulating the problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) on an extended state space. This transformation allows us to search for a Markovian policy, avoiding the complexity of non-Markovian policies. To learn the optimal policy without a system model, and using only trajectory data, we develop a log-barrier policy gradient approach. We prove that under suitable assumptions, the policy parameters converge to the optimal parameters, while ensuring that the system trajectories satisfy the stochastic reach-avoid constraint with high probability.

<title>Order Matters! An Empirical Study on Large Language Models' Input Order Bias in Software Fault Localization</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in software engineering tasks like Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study investigates the impact of input order and context size on LLM performance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We test different orders for methods using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths come first) and "worst" (where ground truths come last), using two benchmarks that consist of both Java and Python projects. Our results indicate a significant bias in order; Top-1 FL accuracy in Java projects drops from 57% to 20%, while in Python projects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3% when we reverse the code order. Breaking down inputs into smaller contexts helps reduce this bias, narrowing the performance gap in FL from 22% to 6% and then to just 1% on both benchmarks. We then investigated whether the bias in order was caused by data leakage by renaming the method names with more meaningful alternatives. Our findings indicated that the trend remained consistent, suggesting that the bias was not due to data leakage. We also look at ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics. Ordering using DepGraph's ranking achieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, which is better than more straightforward ordering approaches like CallGraphDFS. These findings underscore the importance of how we structure inputs, manage contexts, and choose ordering methods to improve LLM performance in FL and other software engineering tasks.

Abstract: Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.

<title>Training-Free Defense Against Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning MRI Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency, we devise a novel mitigation objective that is minimized in a small ball around the attack input. Results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining. We also introduce a practically relevant scenario for small adversarial perturbations that models impulse noise in raw data, which relates to \emph{herringbone artifacts}, and show the applicability of our approach in this setting. Finally, we show our mitigation approach remains effective in two \emph{realistic} extension scenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known to the user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense strategy.

<title>Improving the adaptive and continuous learning capabilities of artificial neural networks: Lessons from multi-neuromodulatory dynamics</title>

Abstract: Continuous, adaptive learning-the ability to adapt to the environment and improve performance-is a hallmark of both natural and artificial intelligence. Biological organisms excel in acquiring, transferring, and retaining knowledge while adapting to dynamic environments, making them a rich source of inspiration for artificial neural networks (ANNs). This study explores how neuromodulation, a fundamental feature of biological learning systems, can help address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and enhance the robustness of ANNs in continuous learning scenarios. Driven by neuromodulators including dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA), neuromodulatory processes in the brain operate at multiple scales, facilitating dynamic responses to environmental changes through mechanisms ranging from local synaptic plasticity to global network-wide adaptability. Importantly, the relationship between neuromodulators, and their interplay in the modulation of sensory and cognitive processes are more complex than expected, demonstrating a "many-to-one" neuromodulator-to-task mapping. To inspire the design of novel neuromodulation-aware learning rules, we highlight (i) how multi-neuromodulatory interactions enrich single-neuromodulator-driven learning, (ii) the impact of neuromodulators at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and correspondingly, (iii) strategies to integrate neuromodulated learning into or approximate it in ANNs. To illustrate these principles, we present a case study to demonstrate how neuromodulation-inspired mechanisms, such as DA-driven reward processing and NA-based cognitive flexibility, can enhance ANN performance in a Go/No-Go task. By integrating multi-scale neuromodulation, we aim to bridge the gap between biological learning and artificial systems, paving the way for ANNs with greater flexibility, robustness, and adaptability.

<title>Gaussian Universality for Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: We investigate Gaussian Universality for data distributions generated via diffusion models. By Gaussian Universality we mean that the test error of a generalized linear model $f(\mathbf{W})$ trained for a classification task on the diffusion data matches the test error of $f(\mathbf{W})$ trained on the Gaussian Mixture with matching means and covariances per class.In other words, the test error depends only on the first and second order statistics of the diffusion-generated data in the linear setting. As a corollary, the analysis of the test error for linear classifiers can be reduced to Gaussian data from diffusion-generated data. Analysing the performance of models trained on synthetic data is a pertinent problem due to the surge of methods such as \cite{sehwag2024stretchingdollardiffusiontraining}. Moreover, we show that, for any $1$- Lipschitz scalar function $\phi$, $\phi(\mathbf{x})$ is close to $\mathbb{E} \phi(\mathbf{x})$ with high probability for $\mathbf{x}$ sampled from the conditional diffusion model corresponding to each class. Finally, we note that current approaches for proving universality do not apply to diffusion-generated data as the covariance matrices of the data tend to have vanishing minimum singular values, contrary to the assumption made in the literature. This leaves extending previous mathematical universality results as an intriguing open question.

Abstract: Feature extraction techniques are crucial in medical image classification; however, classical feature extractors, in addition to traditional machine learning classifiers, often exhibit significant limitations in providing sufficient discriminative information for complex image sets. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown promise in feature extraction, they are prone to overfitting due to the inherent characteristics of medical imaging data, including small sample sizes or high intra-class variance. In this work, the Medical Image Attention-based Feature Extractor (MIAFEx) is proposed, a novel method that employs a learnable refinement mechanism to enhance the classification token within the Transformer encoder architecture. This mechanism adjusts the token based on learned weights, improving the extraction of salient features and enhancing the model's adaptability to the challenges presented by medical imaging data. The MIAFEx output feature quality is compared against classical feature extractors using traditional and hybrid classifiers. Also, the performance of these features is compared against modern CNN and ViT models in classification tasks, demonstrating their superiority in accuracy and robustness across multiple complex medical imaging datasets. This advantage is particularly pronounced in scenarios with limited training data, where traditional and modern models often struggle to generalize effectively. The source code of this proposal can be found at https://github.com/Oscar-RamosS/Medical-Image-Attention-based-Feature-Extractor-MIAFEx

<title>Nirvana AI Governance: How AI Policymaking Is Committing Three Old Fallacies</title>

Abstract: This research applies Harold Demsetz's concept of the nirvana approach to the realm of AI governance and debunks three common fallacies in various AI policy proposals--"the grass is always greener on the other side," "free lunch," and "the people could be different." Through this, I expose fundamental flaws in the current AI regulatory proposal. First, some commentators intuitively believe that people are more reliable than machines and that government works better in risk control than companies' self-regulation, but they do not fully compare the differences between the status quo and the proposed replacements. Second, when proposing some regulatory tools, some policymakers and researchers do not realize and even gloss over the fact that harms and costs are also inherent in their proposals. Third, some policy proposals are initiated based on a false comparison between the AI-driven world, where AI does lead to some risks, and an entirely idealized world, where no risk exists at all. However, the appropriate approach is to compare the world where AI causes risks to the real world where risks are everywhere, but people can live well with these risks. The prevalence of these fallacies in AI governance underscores a broader issue: the tendency to idealize potential solutions without fully considering their real-world implications. This idealization can lead to regulatory proposals that are not only impractical but potentially harmful to innovation and societal progress.

Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms are iterative methods used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this work, we broaden the scope of such analyses by considering settings where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be viewed as a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We also study a variant where the faster time-scale has a projection step which leads to non-expansiveness in the slower time-scale. We show that the last-iterate mean square residual error for such algorithms decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon>0$ is arbitrarily small. We further establish almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.

Abstract: In recent years, information-theoretic generalization bounds have gained increasing attention for analyzing the generalization capabilities of meta-learning algorithms. However, existing results are confined to two-step bounds, failing to provide a sharper characterization of the meta-generalization gap that simultaneously accounts for environment-level and task-level dependencies. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by developing a unified information-theoretic framework using a single-step derivation. The resulting meta-generalization bounds, expressed in terms of diverse information measures, exhibit substantial advantages over previous work, particularly in terms of tightness, scaling behavior associated with sampled tasks and samples per task, and computational tractability. Furthermore, through gradient covariance analysis, we provide new theoretical insights into the generalization properties of two classes of noisy and iterative meta-learning algorithms, where the meta-learner uses either the entire meta-training data (e.g., Reptile), or separate training and test data within the task (e.g., model agnostic meta-learning (MAML)). Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics of meta-learning.

Abstract: Functional data, representing curves or trajectories, are ubiquitous in fields like biomedicine and motion analysis. A fundamental challenge is phase variability -- temporal misalignments that obscure underlying patterns and degrade model performance. Current methods often address registration (alignment) and classification as separate, sequential tasks. This paper introduces DeepFRC, an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly learns diffeomorphic warping functions and a classifier within a unified architecture. DeepFRC combines a neural deformation operator for elastic alignment, a spectral representation using Fourier basis for smooth functional embedding, and a class-aware contrastive loss that promotes both intra-class coherence and inter-class separation. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for such a joint model, proving its ability to approximate optimal warpings and establishing a data-dependent generalization bound that formally links registration fidelity to classification performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DeepFRC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both alignment quality and classification accuracy, while ablation studies validate the synergy of its components. DeepFRC also shows notable robustness to noise, missing data, and varying dataset scales. Code is available at https://github.com/Drivergo-93589/DeepFRC.

Abstract: The probabilistic diffusion model (DM), generating content by inferencing through a recursive chain structure, has emerged as a powerful framework for visual generation. After pre-training on enormous data, the model needs to be properly aligned to meet requirements for downstream applications. How to efficiently align the foundation DM is a crucial task. Contemporary methods are either based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) or truncated Backpropagation (BP). However, RL and truncated BP suffer from low sample efficiency and biased gradient estimation, respectively, resulting in limited improvement or, even worse, complete training failure. To overcome the challenges, we propose the Recursive Likelihood Ratio (RLR) optimizer, a Half-Order (HO) fine-tuning paradigm for DM. The HO gradient estimator enables the computation graph rearrangement within the recursive diffusive chain, making the RLR's gradient estimator an unbiased one with lower variance than other methods. We theoretically investigate the bias, variance, and convergence of our method. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and video generation to validate the superiority of the RLR. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt technique that is natural for the RLR to achieve a synergistic effect.

Abstract: The last decade has seen widespread adoption of Machine Learning (ML) components in software systems. This has occurred in nearly every domain, from natural language processing to computer vision. These ML components range from relatively simple neural networks to complex and resource-intensive large language models. However, despite this widespread adoption, little is known about the supply chain relationships that produce these models, which can have implications for compliance and security. In this work, we conducted an extensive analysis of 760,460 models and 175,000 datasets extracted from the popular model-sharing site Hugging Face. First, we evaluate the current state of documentation in the Hugging Face supply chain, report real-world examples of shortcomings, and offer actionable suggestions for improvement. Next, we analyze the underlying structure of the existing supply chain. Finally, we explore the current licensing landscape against what was reported in previous work and discuss the unique challenges posed in this domain. Our results motivate multiple research avenues, including the need for better license management for ML models/datasets, better support for model documentation, and automated inconsistency checking and validation. We make our research infrastructure and dataset available to facilitate future research.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to differentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text detectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed global threshold (e.g., $\theta = 0.5$) to classify machine-generated text. However, one universal threshold could fail to account for distributional variations by subgroups. For example, when using a fixed threshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written text, and more positive classifications of neurotic writing styles among long texts. These discrepancies can lead to misclassifications that disproportionately affect certain groups. We address this critical limitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold optimization for probabilistic AI-text detectors. We partitioned data into subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and implemented FairOPT to learn decision thresholds for each group to reduce discrepancy. FairOPT showed notable discrepancy mitigation across nine detectors and three heterogeneous datasets, and the remarkable mitigation of the minimax problem by decreasing overall discrepancy 27.4% across five metrics while minimally sacrificing accuracy by 0.005%. Our framework paves the way for more robust classification in AI-generated content detection via post-processing. We release our data, code, and project information at URL.

<title>Noise Sensitivity and Learning Lower Bounds for Hierarchical Functions</title>

Abstract: Recent works explore deep learning's success by examining functions or data with hierarchical structure. To study the learning complexity of functions with hierarchical structure, we study the noise stability of functions with tree hierarchical structure on independent inputs. We show that if each function in the hierarchy is $\varepsilon$-far from linear, the noise stability is exponentially small in the depth of the hierarchy.
  Our results have immediate applications for agnostic learning. In the Boolean setting using the results of Dachman-Soled, Feldman, Tan, Wan and Wimmer (2014), our results provide Statistical Query super-polynomial lower bounds for agnostically learning classes that are based on hierarchical functions.
  We also derive similar SQ lower bounds based on the indicators of crossing events in critical site percolation. These crossing events are not formally hierarchical as we define but still have some hierarchical features as studied in mathematical physics.
  Using the results of Abbe, Bengio, Cornacchiam, Kleinberg, Lotfi, Raghu and Zhang (2022), our results imply sample complexity lower bounds for learning hierarchical functions with gradient descent on fully connected neural networks.
  Finally in the Gaussian setting, using the results of Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas and Zarifis (2021), our results provide super-polynomial lower bounds for agnostic SQ learning.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of intraday electricity prices is essential to manage market uncertainties. However, current methods rely heavily on domain feature extraction, which breaks the end-to-end training pipeline and limits the model's ability to learn expressive representations from the raw orderbook. Moreover, these methods often require training separate models for different quantiles, further violating the end-to-end principle and introducing the quantile crossing issue. Recent advances in time-series models have demonstrated promising performance in general forecasting tasks. However, these models lack inductive biases arising from buy-sell interactions and are thus overparameterized. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end probabilistic model called OrderFusion, which produces interaction-aware representations of buy-sell dynamics, hierarchically estimates multiple quantiles, and remains parameter-efficient with only 4,872 parameters. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on price indices (ID1, ID2, and ID3) using three years of orderbook in high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets. The experimental results demonstrate that OrderFusion consistently outperforms multiple competitive baselines across markets, and ablation studies highlight the contribution of its individual components.

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are essential tools in computational statistics for sampling from unnormalised probability distributions, but can be fragile when targeting high-dimensional, multimodal, or complex target distributions. Parallel Tempering (PT) enhances MCMC's sample efficiency through annealing and parallel computation, propagating samples from tractable reference distributions to intractable targets via state swapping across interpolating distributions. The effectiveness of PT is limited by the often minimal overlap between adjacent distributions in challenging problems, which requires increasing the computational resources to compensate. We introduce a framework that accelerates PT by leveraging neural samplers -- including normalising flows, diffusion models, and controlled diffusions -- to reduce the required overlap. Our approach utilises neural samplers in parallel, circumventing the computational burden of neural samplers while preserving the asymptotic consistency of classical PT. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically on a variety of multimodal sampling problems that our method improves sample quality, reduces the computational cost compared to classical PT, and enables efficient free energy/normalising constant estimation.

<title>Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Quantum Neural Networks via an AI-Driven Submartingale-Based Framework</title>

Abstract: In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for various applications, yet their training is often hindered by barren plateaus (BPs), where gradient variance vanishes exponentially in terms of the qubit size. Most existing initialization-based mitigation strategies rely heavily on pre-designed static parameter distributions, thereby lacking adaptability to diverse model sizes or data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose AdaInit, a foundational framework that leverages generative models with the submartingale property to iteratively synthesize initial parameters for QNNs that yield non-negligible gradient variance, thereby mitigating BPs. Unlike conventional one-shot initialization methods, AdaInit adaptively explores the parameter space by incorporating dataset characteristics and gradient feedback, with theoretical guarantees of convergence to finding a set of effective initial parameters for QNNs. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of the submartingale-based process and empirically validate that AdaInit consistently outperforms existing initialization methods in maintaining higher gradient variance across various QNN scales. We believe this work may initiate a new avenue to mitigate BPs.

<title>Optimal and Provable Calibration in High-Dimensional Binary Classification: Angular Calibration and Platt Scaling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15131</link>

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of calibrating a linear binary classifier of the form $\sigma(\hat{w}^\top x)$, where the feature vector $x$ is Gaussian, $\sigma$ is a link function, and $\hat{w}$ is an estimator of the true linear weight $w^\star$. By interpolating with a noninformative $\textit{chance classifier}$, we construct a well-calibrated predictor whose interpolation weight depends on the angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ between the estimator $\hat{w}$ and the true linear weight $w_\star$. We establish that this angular calibration approach is provably well-calibrated in a high-dimensional regime where the number of samples and features both diverge, at a comparable rate. The angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ can be consistently estimated. Furthermore, the resulting predictor is uniquely $\textit{Bregman-optimal}$, minimizing the Bregman divergence to the true label distribution within a suitable class of calibrated predictors. Our work is the first to provide a calibration strategy that satisfies both calibration and optimality properties provably in high dimensions. Additionally, we identify conditions under which a classical Platt-scaling predictor converges to our Bregman-optimal calibrated solution. Thus, Platt-scaling also inherits these desirable properties provably in high dimensions.

arXiv:2502.16816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first finite-sample analysis of policy evaluation in robust average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Prior work in this setting have established only asymptotic convergence guarantees, leaving open the question of sample complexity. In this work, we address this gap by showing that the robust Bellman operator is a contraction under a carefully constructed semi-norm, and developing a stochastic approximation framework with controlled bias. Our approach builds upon Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques to estimate the robust Bellman operator efficiently. To overcome the infinite expected sample complexity inherent in standard MLMC, we introduce a truncation mechanism based on a geometric distribution, ensuring a finite expected sample complexity while maintaining a small bias that decays exponentially with the truncation level. Our method achieves the order-optimal sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for robust policy evaluation and robust average reward estimation, marking a significant advancement in robust reinforcement learning theory.

Abstract: In the current insurance literature, prediction of insurance claims in the regression problem is often performed with a statistical model. This model-based approach may potentially suffer from several drawbacks: (i) model misspecification, (ii) selection effect, and (iii) lack of finite-sample validity. This article addresses these three issues simultaneously by employing conformal prediction -- a general machine learning strategy for valid predictions. The proposed method is both model-free and tuning-parameter-free. It also guarantees finite-sample validity at a pre-assigned coverage probability level. Examples, based on both simulated and real data, are provided to demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method and its applications in insurance, especially regarding meeting the solvency capital requirement of European insurance regulation, Solvency II.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in fundamental cross-modality research, demonstrating significant potential in both image understanding and generation. However, existing research in the face domain primarily faces two challenges: $\textbf{(1)}$ $\textbf{fragmentation development}$, with existing methods failing to unify understanding and generation into a single one, hindering the way to artificial general intelligence. $\textbf{(2) lack of fine-grained facial attributes}$, which are crucial for high-fidelity applications. To handle those issues, we propose $\textbf{UniF$^2$ace}$, $\textit{the first UMM specifically tailored for fine-grained face understanding and generation}$. $\textbf{First}$, we introduce a novel theoretical framework with a Dual Discrete Diffusion (D3Diff) loss, unifying masked generative models with discrete score matching diffusion and leading to a more precise approximation of the negative log-likelihood. Moreover, this D3Diff significantly enhances the model's ability to synthesize high-fidelity facial details aligned with text input. $\textbf{Second}$, we propose a multi-level grouped Mixture-of-Experts architecture, adaptively incorporating the semantic and identity facial embeddings to complement the attribute forgotten phenomenon in representation evolvement. $\textbf{Finally}$, to this end, we construct UniF$^2$aceD-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 130K fine-grained image-caption pairs and 1M visual question-answering pairs, spanning a much wider range of facial attributes than existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniF$^2$ace outperforms existing models with a similar scale in both understanding and generation tasks, with 7.1\% higher Desc-GPT and 6.6\% higher VQA-score, respectively.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.

Abstract: Grant-free random access (GF-RA) is a promising access technique for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in future wireless networks, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond (6G) systems. Within the context of GF-RA, this study investigates the efficiency of employing supervised machine learning techniques to tackle the challenges on the device activity detection (AD). GF-RA addresses scalability by employing non-orthogonal pilot sequences, which provides an efficient alternative comparing to conventional grant-based random access (GB-RA) technique that are constrained by the scarcity of orthogonal preamble resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight data-driven algorithmic framework specifically designed for activity detection in GF-RA for mMTC in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. We propose two distinct framework deployment strategies, centralized and decentralized, both tailored to streamline the proposed approach implementation across network infrastructures. Moreover, we introduce optimized post-detection methodologies complemented by a clustering stage to enhance overall detection performances. Our 3GPP-compliant simulations have validated that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art model-based activity detection accuracy while significantly reducing complexity. Achieving 99% accuracy, it demonstrates real-world viability and effectiveness.

<title>Safety Mirage: How Spurious Correlations Undermine VLM Safety Fine-Tuning and Can Be Mitigated by Machine Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Recent vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable strides in generative modeling with multimodal inputs, particularly text and images. However, their susceptibility to generating harmful content when exposed to unsafe queries raises critical safety concerns. While current alignment strategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated datasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the ''safety mirage'', where supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations between superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than fostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious correlations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word modification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries with a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass safeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over-prudence, causing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily. To address these issues, we show machine unlearning (MU) as a powerful alternative to supervised safety fine-tuning, as it avoids biased feature-label mappings and directly removes harmful knowledge from VLMs while preserving their general capabilities. Extensive evaluations across safety benchmarks show that under MU-based alignment reduces the attack success rate by up to 60.17% and cuts unnecessary rejections by over 84.20%. WARNING: There exist AI generations that may be offensive in nature.

arXiv:2503.15441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a categorical embedding discontinuity-capturing shallow neural network for anisotropic elliptic interface problems. The architecture comprises three hidden layers: a discontinuity-capturing layer, which maps domain segments to disconnected sets in a higher-dimensional space; a categorical embedding layer, which reduces the high-dimensional information into low-dimensional features; and a fully connected layer, which models the continuous mapping. This design enables a single neural network to approximate piecewise smooth functions with high accuracy, even when the number of discontinuous pieces ranges from tens to hundreds. By automatically learning discontinuity embeddings, the proposed categorical embedding technique avoids the need for explicit domain labeling, providing a scalable, efficient, and mesh-free framework for approximating piecewise continuous solutions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply the proposed method to solve anisotropic elliptic interface problems, training by minimizing the mean squared error loss of the governing system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, despite its shallow and simple structure, the proposed method achieves accuracy and efficiency comparable to traditional grid-based numerical methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies in this field include deep learning, graph neural networks, Bayesian optimization, and automated generative models (GANs, VAEs). These approaches enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (AutoGluon, TPOT, and H2O.ai), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, combining AI with automated experimentation and computational modeling is transforming the way materials are discovered and optimized. This synergy paves the way for new innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.

Abstract: We introduce the sequential multi-object robotic grasp sampling algorithm SeqGrasp that can robustly synthesize stable grasps on diverse objects using the robotic hand's partial Degrees of Freedom (DoF). We use SeqGrasp to construct the large-scale Allegro Hand sequential grasping dataset SeqDataset and use it for training the diffusion-based sequential grasp generator SeqDiffuser. We experimentally evaluate SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser against the state-of-the-art non-sequential multi-object grasp generation method MultiGrasp in simulation and on a real robot. The experimental results demonstrate that SeqGrasp and SeqDiffuser reach an 8.71%-43.33% higher grasp success rate than MultiGrasp. Furthermore, SeqDiffuser is approximately 1000 times faster at generating grasps than SeqGrasp and MultiGrasp. Project page: https://yulihn.github.io/SeqGrasp/.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by learning from massive datasets, yet this rapid progress has also drawn legal scrutiny, as the ability to unintentionally generate copyrighted content has already prompted several prominent lawsuits. In this work, we introduce SUV (Selective Unlearning for Verbatim data), a selective unlearning framework designed to prevent LLM from memorizing copyrighted content while preserving its overall utility. In detail, the proposed method constructs a dataset that captures instances of copyrighted infringement cases by the targeted LLM. With the dataset, we unlearn the content from the LLM by means of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which replaces the verbatim copyrighted content with plausible and coherent alternatives. Since DPO may hinder the LLM's performance in other unrelated tasks, we integrate gradient projection and Fisher information regularization to mitigate the degradation. We validate our approach using a large-scale dataset of 500 famous books (predominantly copyrighted works) and demonstrate that SUV significantly reduces verbatim memorization with negligible impact on the performance on unrelated tasks. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and public benchmarks confirm the scalability and efficacy of our approach, offering a promising solution for mitigating copyright risks in real-world LLM applications.

Abstract: Cross-lingual open-ended generation - responding in a language different from that of the query - is an important yet understudied problem. This work proposes XL-Instruct, a novel technique for generating high-quality synthetic data, and introduces XL-AlpacaEval, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our experiments show that fine-tuning with just 8K instructions generated using XL-Instruct significantly improves model performance, increasing the win rate against GPT-4o-Mini from 7.4% to 21.5% and improving on several fine-grained quality metrics. Moreover, base LLMs fine-tuned on XL-Instruct exhibit strong zero-shot improvements to question answering in the same language, as shown on our machine-translated m-AlpacaEval. These consistent gains highlight the promising role of XL-Instruct in the post-training of multilingual LLMs. Finally, we publicly release XL-Suite, a collection of training and evaluation data to facilitate research in cross-lingual open-ended generation.

<title>SentenceKV: Efficient LLM Inference via Sentence-Level Semantic KV Caching</title>

arXiv:2504.00970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models face significant computational and memory challenges when processing long contexts. During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.

Abstract: Advances in AI-generated content have led to wide adoption of large language models, diffusion-based visual generators, and synthetic audio tools. However, these developments raise critical concerns about misinformation, copyright infringement, security threats, and the erosion of public trust. In this paper, we explore an extensive range of methods designed to detect and mitigate AI-generated textual, visual, and audio content. We begin by discussing motivations and potential impacts associated with AI-based content generation, including real-world risks and ethical dilemmas. We then outline detection techniques spanning observation-based strategies, linguistic and statistical analysis, model-based pipelines, watermarking and fingerprinting, as well as emergent ensemble approaches. We also present new perspectives on robustness, adaptation to rapidly improving generative architectures, and the critical role of human-in-the-loop verification. By surveying state-of-the-art research and highlighting case studies in academic, journalistic, legal, and industrial contexts, this paper aims to inform robust solutions and policymaking. We conclude by discussing open challenges, including adversarial transformations, domain generalization, and ethical concerns, thereby offering a holistic guide for researchers, practitioners, and regulators to preserve content authenticity in the face of increasingly sophisticated AI-generated media.

Abstract: Commercial Large Language Model (LLM) APIs create a fundamental trust problem: users pay for specific models but have no guarantee that providers deliver them faithfully. Providers may covertly substitute cheaper alternatives (e.g., quantized versions, smaller models) to reduce costs while maintaining advertised pricing. We formalize this model substitution problem and systematically evaluate detection methods under realistic adversarial conditions. Our empirical analysis reveals that software-only methods are fundamentally unreliable: statistical tests on text outputs are query-intensive and fail against subtle substitutions, while methods using log probabilities are defeated by inherent inference nondeterminism in production environments. We argue that this verification gap can be more effectively closed with hardware-level security. We propose and evaluate the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as one practical and robust solution. Our findings demonstrate that TEEs can provide provable cryptographic guarantees of model integrity with only a modest performance overhead, offering a clear and actionable path to ensure users get what they pay for.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of the random Gaussian smoothing Zeroth-Order ExtraGradient (ZO-EG) scheme considering \Af{deterministic} min-max optimisation problems with possibly NonConvex-NonConcave (NC-NC) objective functions. We consider both unconstrained and constrained, differentiable and non-differentiable settings. We discuss the min-max problem from the point of view of variational inequalities. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to the neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the NC-NC objective function, whose radius can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme, along with its complexity. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal variational inequalities and give examples of functions satisfying this property. Moreover, we prove analogous results to the unconstrained case for the constrained problem. For the non-differentiable case, we prove the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to a neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the smoothed version of the objective function, where the radius of the neighbourhood can be controlled, which can be related to the ($\delta,\epsilon$)-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective function.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.

<title>TRACE Back from the Future: A Probabilistic Reasoning Approach to Controllable Language Generation</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LMs) advance, there is an increasing need to control their outputs to align with human values (e.g., detoxification) or desired attributes (e.g., personalization, topic). However, autoregressive models focus on next-token predictions and struggle with global properties that require looking ahead. Existing solutions either post-train LMs for each new attribute--expensive and inflexible--or approximate the Expected Attribute Probability (EAP) of future sequences by sampling or training, which is slow and unreliable for rare attributes. We introduce TRACE (Tractable Probabilistic Reasoning for Adaptable Controllable gEneration), a novel framework that efficiently computes EAP and adapts to new attributes through tractable probabilistic reasoning and lightweight control. TRACE distills a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an LM and pairs it with a small classifier to estimate attribute probabilities, enabling exact EAP computation over the HMM's predicted futures. This EAP is then used to reweigh the LM's next-token probabilities for globally compliant continuations. Empirically, TRACE achieves state-of-the-art detoxification results with only 20% decoding overhead, yields 76 low-resource personalized LMs within seconds, and seamlessly extends to composite attributes. Our code is available at: https://github.com/yidouweng/trace.

Abstract: We study the consistency of minimum-norm interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces corresponding to bounded kernels. Our main result give lower bounds for the generalization error of the kernel interpolation measured in a continuous scale of norms that interpolate between $L^2$ and the hypothesis space. These lower bounds imply that kernel interpolation is always inconsistent, when the smoothness index of the norm is larger than a constant that depends only on the embedding index of the hypothesis space and the decay rate of the eigenvalues.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks, yet they struggle to produce truly creative, diverse ideas. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that enhances LLM creativity. We apply LLMs for translating between natural language and structured representations, and perform the core creative leap via cognitively inspired manipulations on these representations. Our notion of creativity goes beyond superficial token-level variations; rather, we recombine structured representations of existing ideas, enabling our system to effectively explore a more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes. Experiments and domain-expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly coherent and feasible, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms of novelty and diversity, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can internalize new information and accurately internalize their implications to perform downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the information (news) is explicitly given as context, adequately integrating the information into model weights via fine-tuning remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce New News, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. First, we demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications, and Self-QA -- designed to distill the knowledge processed by the model with context into the weights of the model, which we term System-2 Fine-tuning (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the Self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news while preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we discover the contextual shadowing effect, where training with the news in context followed by its rephrases or QAs catastrophically degrades learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

Abstract: Reactive dance generation (RDG), the task of generating a dance conditioned on a lead dancer's motion, holds significant promise for enhancing human-robot interaction and immersive digital entertainment. Despite progress in duet synchronization and motion-music alignment, two key challenges remain: generating fine-grained spatial interactions and ensuring long-term temporal coherence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{ReactDance}, a diffusion framework that operates on a novel hierarchical latent space to address these spatiotemporal challenges in RDG. First, for high-fidelity spatial expression and fine-grained control, we propose Hierarchical Finite Scalar Quantization (\textbf{HFSQ}). This multi-scale motion representation effectively disentangles coarse body posture from subtle limb dynamics, enabling independent and detailed control over both aspects through a layered guidance mechanism. Second, to efficiently generate long sequences with high temporal coherence, we propose Blockwise Local Context (\textbf{BLC}), a non-autoregressive sampling strategy. Departing from slow, frame-by-frame generation, BLC partitions the sequence into blocks and synthesizes them in parallel via periodic causal masking and positional encodings. Coherence across these blocks is ensured by a dense sliding-window training approach that enriches the representation with local temporal context. Extensive experiments show that ReactDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in motion quality, long-term coherence, and sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Conversational query reformulation (CQR) has become indispensable for improving retrieval in dialogue-based applications. However, existing approaches typically rely on reference passages for optimization, which are impractical to acquire in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel reference-free preference optimization framework DualReform that generates pseudo reference passages from commonly-encountered conversational datasets containing only queries and responses. DualReform attains this goal through two key innovations: (1) response-based inference, where responses serve as proxies to infer pseudo reference passages, and (2) response refinement via the dual-role of CQR, where a CQR model refines responses based on the shared objectives between response refinement and CQR. Despite not relying on reference passages, DualReform achieves 96.9--99.1% of the retrieval accuracy attainable only with reference passages and surpasses the state-of-the-art method by up to 31.6%.

Abstract: Counting properties (e.g. determining whether certain tokens occur more than other tokens in a given input text) have played a significant role in the study of expressiveness of transformers. In this paper, we provide a formal framework for investigating the counting power of transformers. We argue that all existing results demonstrate transformers' expressivity only for (semi-)linear counting properties, i.e., which are expressible as a boolean combination of linear inequalities. Our main result is that transformers can express counting properties that are highly nonlinear. More precisely, we prove that transformers can capture all semialgebraic counting properties, i.e., expressible as a boolean combination of arbitrary multivariate polynomials (of any degree). Among others, these generalize the counting properties that can be captured by C-RASP softmax transformers, which capture only linear counting properties. To complement this result, we exhibit a natural subclass of (softmax) transformers that completely characterizes semialgebraic counting properties. Through connections with the Hilbert's tenth problem, this expressivity of transformers also yields a new undecidability result for analyzing an extremely simple transformer model -- surprisingly with neither positional encodings (i.e. NoPE-transformers) nor masking. We also experimentally validate trainability of such counting properties.

<title>Critique-Guided Distillation for Efficient and Robust Language Model Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with expert demonstrations often suffers from the imitation problem, where models reproduce correct responses without internalizing the underlying reasoning. We propose Critique-Guided Distillation (CGD), a multi-stage training framework that augments SFT with teacher-generated explanatory critiques and refined responses. Instead of directly imitating teacher outputs, a student learns to map the triplet of prompt, its own initial response, and teacher critique into the refined teacher response, thereby capturing both what to output and why. Our analyses show that CGD consistently reduces refinement uncertainty, improves alignment between critiques and responses, and enhances sample efficiency. On reasoning benchmarks, CGD achieves substantial gains across LLaMA and Qwen families, including +15.0% on AMC23 and +12.2% on MATH-500, while avoiding the format drift issues observed in prior critique-based fine-tuning. Importantly, on LLaMA-3.1-8B CGD approaches or exceeds the performance of SimpleRL-Zero, which is a DeepSeek-R1 replication, while requiring 60x less compute. Beyond reasoning, CGD maintains or improves general instruction-following and factual accuracy, matching baseline performance on IFEval, MUSR, TruthfulQA, and BBH. In contrast, prior critique-based methods degrade these capabilities (e.g., -21% on IFEval). Taken together, these results establish CGD} as a robust and generalizable alternative to both conventional SFT and RL-based methods, offering a more efficient path toward advancing the reasoning and safety of large language models.

<title>Fine-grained Contrastive Learning for ECG-Report Alignment with Waveform Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, existing ECG-Report contrastive learning methods focus on whole-ECG and report alignment, missing the link between local ECG features and individual report tags. In this paper, we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which achieves fine-grained alignment between specific ECG segments and each tag in the report via tag-specific ECG representations. Furthermore, we found that nearly 55\% of ECG reports in the MIMIC-ECG training dataset lack detailed waveform features, which hinders fine-grained alignment. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine training process that leverages large language models (LLMs) to recover these missing waveform features and validate the LLM outputs using a coarse model. Additionally, fine-grained alignment at the tag level, rather than at the report level, exacerbates the false negative problem, as different reports may share common tags. To mitigate this, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide the model in identifying and correcting false negatives. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP significantly improves fine-grained alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot prediction and linear probing. Meanwhile, the fine-grained reports we generate also enhance the performance of other methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N sampling, offer a simple and effective way to steer language models (LMs) toward preferred behaviors using reward models (RM). However, these approaches can be computationally expensive, especially when applied uniformly across prompts without accounting for differences in alignment difficulty. In this work, we propose a prompt-adaptive strategy for Best-of-N alignment that allocates inference-time compute more efficiently. Motivated by latency concerns, we develop a two-stage algorithm: an initial exploratory phase estimates the reward distribution for each prompt using a small exploration budget, and a second stage adaptively allocates the remaining budget using these estimates. Our method is simple, practical, and compatible with any LM-RM combination. Empirical results on prompts from the AlpacaEval, HH-RLHF, and PKU-SafeRLHF datasets for 12 LM/RM pairs and 50 different batches of prompts show that our adaptive strategy outperforms the uniform allocation with the same inference budget. Moreover, we show that our adaptive strategy remains competitive against uniform allocations with 20 percent larger inference budgets and improves in performance as the batch size grows.

Abstract: Evaluating open-ended outputs of Multimodal Large Language Models has become a bottleneck as model capabilities, task diversity, and modality rapidly expand. Existing ``MLLM-as-a-Judge'' evaluators, though promising, remain constrained to specific tasks and aspects. In this paper, we argue that, on one hand, based on the interconnected nature of aspects, learning specific aspects can generalize to unseen aspects; on the other hand, jointly learning to assess multiple visual aspects and tasks may foster a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose UFEval, the first unified fine-grained evaluator with task and aspect generalization for four evaluation tasks -- Natural Language Generation, Image Understanding, Image Generation, and Interleaved Text-and-Image Generation. However, training such a unified evaluator is hindered by the lack of a large-scale, multi-modal, and aspect-level resource. To address this gap, we introduce FRABench, a comprehensive fine-grained evaluation dataset. Specifically, (1) We first construct a hierarchical aspect taxonomy encompassing 112 distinct aspects across the aforementioned four tasks. (2) Based on this taxonomy, we create FRABench, comprising 60.4k pairwise samples with 325k evaluation labels obtained from a combination of human and GPT-4o annotations. (3) Finally, leveraging FRABench, we develop UFEval, a unified fine-grained evaluator. Experiments show that learning on specific aspects enables UFEval to generalize to unseen aspects, and joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks and aspects can lead to substantial mutual benefits.

Abstract: A prominent issue in aligning language models (LMs) to personalized preferences is underspecification-- the lack of information from users about their preferences. A popular trend of injecting such specification is adding a prefix (e.g. prior relevant conversations) to the current user's conversation to steer preference distribution. Most methods passively model personal preferences with prior example preferences pairs. We ask whether models benefit from actively inferring preference descriptions, and address this question by creating a synthetic personalized alignment dataset based on famous people with known public preferences. We then test how effective finetuned 1-8B size models are at inferring and aligning to personal preferences. Results show that higher-quality active prefixes lead to better generalization, more contextually faithful models, and less systematic biases across different protected attributes. All our results suggest active alignment can lead to a more controllable and efficient path for personalized alignment.

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However, retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model, facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems. Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform with DAU > 300M), to serve the major online traffic.

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) utilizes structured demonstration-query inputs to induce few-shot learning on Language Models (LMs), which are not originally pre-trained on ICL-style data. To bridge the gap between ICL and pre-training, some approaches fine-tune LMs on large ICL-style datasets by an end-to-end paradigm with massive computational costs. To reduce such costs, in this paper, we propose Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning (ABFT), utilizing the previous findings on the inner mechanism of ICL, building training objectives on the attention scores instead of the final outputs, to force the attention scores to focus on the correct label tokens presented in the context and mitigate attention scores from the wrong label tokens. Our experiments on 9 modern LMs and 8 datasets empirically find that ABFT outperforms in performance, robustness, unbiasedness, and efficiency, with only around 0.01% data cost compared to the previous methods. Moreover, our subsequent analysis finds that the end-to-end training objective contains the ABFT objective, suggesting the implicit bias of ICL-style data to the emergence of induction heads. Our work demonstrates the possibility of controlling specific module sequences within LMs to improve their behavior, opening up the future application of mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: World models, which predict future transitions from past observation and action sequences, have shown great promise for improving data efficiency in sequential decision-making. However, existing world models often require extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse predictions, limiting their usefulness in complex environments. In contrast, video diffusion models trained on large-scale internet data have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World systematically explores video diffusion causalization, reshaping both the architecture and training objective of pre-trained models to enable autoregressive generation. Additionally, it incorporates a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action controllability in the resulting interactive world models. Extensive experiments across multiple domains, including robot manipulation, 3D game simulation, and open-world navigation, demonstrate that our method offers a scalable and effective pathway for repurposing highly capable video diffusion models into interactive world models.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit an $\textit{internal chain-of-thought}$: they sequentially decompose and execute composite tasks layer-by-layer. Two claims ground our study: (i) distinct subtasks are learned at different network depths, and (ii) these subtasks are executed sequentially across layers. On a benchmark of 15 two-step composite tasks, we employ layer-from context-masking and propose a novel cross-task patching method, confirming (i). To examine claim (ii), we apply LogitLens to decode hidden states, revealing a consistent layerwise execution pattern. We further replicate our analysis on the real-world $\text{TRACE}$ benchmark, observing the same stepwise dynamics. Together, our results enhance LLMs transparency by showing their capacity to internally plan and execute subtasks (or instructions), opening avenues for fine-grained, instruction-level activation steering.

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors, it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space -- the stylistic feature space -- that is robust to such optimization, and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions become distinguishable. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to avoid reliance on machine-text detection.

<title>ReflAct: World-Grounded Decision Making in LLM Agents via Goal-State Reflection</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry). Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 99.3% of color and 80.8% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together, these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual behavior in multimodal models.

<title>Boosting Open Set Recognition Performance through Modulated Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, the existing OSR methods use a constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated representation learning using a set of proposed temperature schedules, including our novel negative cosine schedule. Our temperature schedules allow the model to form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more neighbors to smooth out the rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our schedules can be folded into any existing OSR loss function with no overhead. We implement the novel schedule on top of a number of baselines, using cross-entropy, contrastive and the ARPL loss functions and find that it boosts both the OSR and the closed set performance in most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks. Project codes will be available.

Abstract: Achieving political consensus is crucial yet challenging for the effective functioning of social governance. However, although frontier AI systems represented by large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, their capabilities in this scope are still understudied. In this paper, we introduce PoliCon, a novel benchmark constructed from 2,225 high-quality deliberation records of the European Parliament over 13 years, ranging from 2009 to 2022, to evaluate the ability of LLMs to draft consensus resolutions based on divergent party positions under varying collective decision-making contexts and political requirements. Specifically, PoliCon incorporates four factors to build each task environment for finding different political consensus: specific political issues, political goals, participating parties, and power structures based on seat distribution. We also developed an evaluation framework based on social choice theory for PoliCon, which simulates the real voting outcomes of different political parties to assess whether LLM-generated resolutions meet the requirements of the predetermined political consensus. Our experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models remain undersatisfied with complex tasks like passing resolutions by a two-thirds majority and addressing security issues, while uncovering their inherent partisan biases and revealing some behaviors LLMs show to achieve the consensus, such as prioritizing the stance of the dominant party instead of uniting smaller parties, which highlights PoliCon's promise as an effective platform for studying LLMs' ability to promote political consensus.

Abstract: Self-taught reasoners (STaRs) enhance the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by leveraging self-generated responses for self-training. Recent studies have incorporated reward models to guide response selection or decoding, aiming to obtain higher-quality data. However, they typically allocate a uniform sampling budget across all problems, overlooking the varying utility of problems at different difficulty levels. In this work, we conduct an empirical study and find that problems near the boundary of the LLM's reasoning capability offer significantly greater learning utility than both easy and overly difficult ones. To identify and exploit such problems, we propose HS-STaR, a Hierarchical Sampling framework for Self-Taught Reasoners. Given a fixed sampling budget, HS-STaR first performs lightweight pre-sampling with a reward-guided difficulty estimation strategy to efficiently identify boundary-level problems. Subsequently, it dynamically reallocates the remaining budget toward these high-utility problems during a re-sampling phase, maximizing the generation of valuable training data. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks and backbone LLMs demonstrate that HS-STaR significantly outperforms other baselines without requiring additional sampling budget.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely used technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), but its performance degrades as input length grows, with significant drops even at moderate lengths. Yet, this early degradation has remained largely underexplored. We introduce SpecExtend, a drop-in enhancement that improves speculative decoding on long sequences without additional training. SpecExtend integrates efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Hybrid Tree Attention to accelerate prefill and verification steps. To improve both draft accuracy and speed on long inputs without retraining, we propose Cross-model Retrieval, a novel KV cache eviction strategy that leverages the target model's attention scores to dynamically select relevant context for the smaller draft model. Extensive evaluations show that SpecExtend accelerates speculative decoding by up to 2.84x on 16K-token long summarization and up to 3.86x on long reasoning, while preserving the short-input performance of state-of-the-art frameworks. Our code is available at https://github.com/jycha98/SpecExtend .

<title>Convergence of Clipped-SGD for Convex $(L_0,L_1)$-Smooth Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a widely used technique in Machine Learning and Deep Learning (DL), known for its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in the training of large language models. Additionally, first-order methods with clipping, such as Clip-SGD, exhibit stronger convergence guarantees than SGD under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption, a property observed in many DL tasks. However, the high-probability convergence of Clip-SGD under both assumptions -- heavy-tailed noise and $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness -- has not been fully addressed in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by establishing the first high-probability convergence bounds for Clip-SGD applied to convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our analysis extends prior results by recovering known bounds for the deterministic case and the stochastic setting with $L_1 = 0$ as special cases. Notably, our rates avoid exponentially large factors and do not rely on restrictive sub-Gaussian noise assumptions, significantly broadening the applicability of gradient clipping.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in image generation, but they also raise significant concerns regarding privacy and copyright issues. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are designed to ascertain whether specific data were utilized during a model's training phase. As current MIAs for diffusion models typically exploit the model's image prediction ability, we formalize them into a unified general paradigm which computes the membership score for membership identification. Under this paradigm, we empirically find that existing attacks overlook the inherent deficiency in how diffusion models process high-frequency information. Consequently, this deficiency leads to member data with more high-frequency content being misclassified as hold-out data, and hold-out data with less high-frequency content tend to be misclassified as member data. Moreover, we theoretically demonstrate that this deficiency reduces the membership advantage of attacks, thereby interfering with the effective discrimination of member data and hold-out data. Based on this insight, we propose a plug-and-play high-frequency filter module to mitigate the adverse effects of the deficiency, which can be seamlessly integrated into any attacks within this general paradigm without additional time costs. Extensive experiments corroborate that this module significantly improves the performance of baseline attacks across different datasets and models.

arXiv:2505.21956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image generation increasingly demands access to domain-specific, fine-grained, and rapidly evolving knowledge that pretrained models cannot fully capture, necessitating the integration of retrieval methods. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods attempt to address this by retrieving globally relevant images, but they fail when no single image contains all desired elements from a complex user query. We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, WikiArt, CUB, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that Cross-modal RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines in the retrieval and further contributes to generation quality, while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce ODE-GS, a novel approach that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to enable future extrapolation of dynamic 3D scenes. Unlike existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods, which rely on time-conditioned deformation networks and are limited to interpolation within a fixed time window, ODE-GS eliminates timestamp dependency by modeling Gaussian parameter trajectories as continuous-time latent dynamics. Our approach first learns an interpolation model to generate accurate Gaussian trajectories within the observed window, then trains a Transformer encoder to aggregate past trajectories into a latent state evolved via a neural ODE. Finally, numerical integration produces smooth, physically plausible future Gaussian trajectories, enabling rendering at arbitrary future timestamps. On the D-NeRF, NVFi, and HyperNeRF benchmarks, ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation performance, improving metrics by 19.8% compared to leading baselines, demonstrating its ability to accurately represent and predict 3D scene dynamics.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of soft-tissue interactions is fundamental for advancing surgical simulation, surgical robotics, and model-based surgical automation. To achieve real-time latency, classical Finite Element Method (FEM) solvers are often replaced with neural approximations; however, naively training such models in a fully data-driven manner without incorporating physical priors frequently leads to poor generalization and physically implausible predictions. We present a novel physics-informed neural simulation framework that enables real-time prediction of soft-tissue deformations under complex single- and multi-grasper interactions. Our approach integrates Kelvinlet-based analytical priors with large-scale FEM data, capturing both linear and nonlinear tissue responses. This hybrid design improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility across diverse neural architectures while maintaining the low-latency performance required for interactive applications. We validate our method on challenging surgical manipulation tasks involving standard laparoscopic grasping tools, demonstrating substantial improvements in deformation fidelity and temporal stability over existing baselines. These results establish Kelvinlet-augmented learning as a principled and computationally efficient paradigm for real-time, physics-aware soft-tissue simulation in surgical AI.

Abstract: Machine learning models are being increasingly used to automate decisions in almost every domain, and ensuring the performance of these models is crucial for ensuring high quality machine learning enabled services. Ensuring concept drift is detected early is thus of the highest importance. A lot of research on concept drift has focused on the supervised case that assumes the true labels of supervised tasks are available immediately after making predictions. Controlling for false positives while monitoring the performance of predictive models used to make inference from extremely large datasets periodically, where the true labels are not instantly available, becomes extremely challenging. We propose a flexible and efficient concept drift detection algorithm that uses classical statistical process control in a label-less setting to accurately detect concept drifts. We show empirically that under computational constraints, our approach has better statistical power than previous known methods. Furthermore, we introduce a new semi-supervised drift detection framework to model the scenario of detecting drift (without labels) given prior detections, and show how our drift detection algorithm can be incorporated effectively into this framework. We demonstrate promising performance via numerical simulations.

Abstract: Adversarial threats against LLMs are escalating faster than current defenses can adapt. We expose a critical geometric blind spot in alignment: adversarial prompts exploit latent camouflage, embedding perilously close to the safe representation manifold while encoding unsafe intent thereby evading surface level defenses like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which remain blind to the latent geometry. We introduce ALKALI, the first rigorously curated adversarial benchmark and the most comprehensive to date spanning 9,000 prompts across three macro categories, six subtypes, and fifteen attack families. Evaluation of 21 leading LLMs reveals alarmingly high Attack Success Rates (ASRs) across both open and closed source models, exposing an underlying vulnerability we term latent camouflage, a structural blind spot where adversarial completions mimic the latent geometry of safe ones. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce GRACE - Geometric Representation Aware Contrastive Enhancement, an alignment framework coupling preference learning with latent space regularization. GRACE enforces two constraints: latent separation between safe and adversarial completions, and adversarial cohesion among unsafe and jailbreak behaviors. These operate over layerwise pooled embeddings guided by a learned attention profile, reshaping internal geometry without modifying the base model, and achieve up to 39% ASR reduction. Moreover, we introduce AVQI, a geometry aware metric that quantifies latent alignment failure via cluster separation and compactness. AVQI reveals when unsafe completions mimic the geometry of safe ones, offering a principled lens into how models internally encode safety. We make the code publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/alkali-B416/README.md.

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.

Abstract: We prove that any Turing machine running on inputs of arbitrary length can be simulated by a constant bit-size transformer, as long as the context window is sufficiently long. This improves previous works, which require scaling up either the model's precision or the number of parameters on longer inputs. Furthermore, we prove that the complexity class SPACE$[s(n)]$ exactly characterizes the expressive power of a constant bit-size transformer with a context window of length $s(n)$. Our approach relies on simulating Post machines, a Turing-complete computational model. Post machines can be modeled as automata equipped with a queue, exhibiting computational behaviors naturally aligned with those of transformers. The behavioral similarity between transformers and Post machines may offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying the reasoning abilities of transformers.

Abstract: Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. We propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich descriptions and contextual cues contains sufficient information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics for spotting actions in soccer matches. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events coming close to state-of-the-art video-based spotters while using zero video processing compute and similar amount of time to process the entire match.

Abstract: We present Prover Agent, a novel AI agent for automated theorem proving that integrates large language models (LLMs) with a formal proof assistant, Lean. Prover Agent coordinates an informal reasoning LLM, a formal prover model, and feedback from Lean while also generating auxiliary lemmas. These auxiliary lemmas are not limited to subgoals in the formal proof but can also include special cases or potentially useful facts derived from the assumptions, which help in discovering a viable proof strategy. It achieves an 88.1% success rate on the MiniF2F benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods using small language models (SLMs) with a much lower sample budget than previous approaches. We also present theoretical analyses and case studies that illustrate how these generated lemmas contribute to solving challenging problems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong reasoning abilities in domains like mathematics, coding, and scientific problem-solving, yet their potential for ranking tasks, where prime examples include retrieval, recommender systems, and LLM routing, remains underexplored. Ranking requires complex reasoning across heterogeneous candidates, but existing LLM-based rankers are often domain-specific, tied to fixed backbones, and lack iterative refinement, limiting their ability to fully exploit LLMs' reasoning potential. To address these challenges, we propose R1-Ranker, a reasoning-incentive framework built on reinforcement learning, with two complementary designs: DRanker, which generates full rankings in one shot, and IRanker, which decomposes ranking into an iterative elimination process with step-wise rewards to encourage deeper reasoning. We evaluate unified R1-Rankers on nine datasets spanning recommendation, routing, and passage ranking, showing that IRanker-3B consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses larger 7B models on some tasks, and yields a 15.7% average relative improvement. Ablation and generalization experiments further confirm the critical role of reinforcement learning and iterative reasoning, with IRanker-3B improving zero-shot performance by over 9% on out-of-domain tasks and reasoning traces boosting other LLMs by up to 22.87%. These results demonstrate that unifying diverse ranking tasks with a single reasoning-driven foundation model is both effective and essential for advancing LLM reasoning in ranking scenarios.

Abstract: Many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models for link prediction use powerful encoders. However, they often rely on a simple hidden vector-matrix multiplication to score subject-relation queries against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than the model's embedding dimension, which is often the case in practice by several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGEs. We find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt the ranking accuracy and distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer to break rank bottlenecks in many KGEs. Our experiments show that KGE-MoS improves ranking performance of KGE models on large-scale datasets at a low parameter cost.

Abstract: Deep learning for human sensing on edge systems presents significant potential for smart applications. However, its training and development are hindered by the limited availability of sensor data and resource constraints of edge systems. While transferring pre-trained models to different sensing applications is promising, existing methods often require extensive sensor data and computational resources, resulting in high costs and poor adaptability in practice. In this paper, we propose XTransfer, a first-of-its-kind method enabling modality-agnostic, few-shot model transfer with resource-efficient design. XTransfer flexibly uses single or multiple pre-trained models and transfers knowledge across different modalities by (i) model repairing that safely mitigates modality shift by adapting pre-trained layers with only few sensor data, and (ii) layer recombining that efficiently searches and recombines layers of interest from source models in a layer-wise manner to create compact models. We benchmark various baselines across diverse human sensing datasets spanning different modalities. Comprehensive results demonstrate that XTransfer achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the costs of sensor data collection, model training, and edge deployment.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method. Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize reasoning steps. The code is available at https://github.com/wenquanlu/huginn-latent-cot.

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence rate for the last iterate of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) in the parametric setting when the objective function $F$ is globally convex or non-convex whose gradient is $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder. Using only discrete Gronwall's inequality without Robbins-Siegmund theorem, we recover results for both SGD and SHB: $\min_{s\leq t} \|\nabla F(w_s)\|^2 = o(t^{p-1})$ for non-convex objectives and $F(w_t) - F_* = o(t^{2\gamma/(1+\gamma) \cdot \max(p-1,-2p+1)-\epsilon})$ for $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $\min_{s \leq t} F(w_s) - F_* = o(t^{p-1})$ almost surely for convex objectives. In addition, we proved that SHB with constant momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ attains a convergence rate of $F(w_t) - F_* = O(t^{\max(p-1,-2p+1)} \log^2 \frac{t}{\delta})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ when $F$ is convex and $\gamma = 1$ and step size $\alpha_t = \Theta(t^{-p})$ with $p \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms, represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve competitive performance on large-scale speech processing tasks. Two key challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS) mechanism, which simulates multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further integrates a Re-parameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$ respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy efficiency. Our source code and model checkpoints are publicly available at github.com/Pooookeman/IML-Spikeformer.

<title>Mitigating Watermark Forgery in Generative Models via Randomized Key Selection</title>

Abstract: Watermarking enables GenAI providers to verify whether content was generated by their models. A watermark is a hidden signal in the content, whose presence can be detected using a secret watermark key. A core security threat are forgery attacks, where adversaries insert the provider's watermark into content \emph{not} produced by the provider, potentially damaging their reputation and undermining trust. Existing defenses resist forgery by embedding many watermarks with multiple keys into the same content, which can degrade model utility. However, forgery remains a threat when attackers can collect sufficiently many watermarked samples. We propose a defense that is provably forgery-resistant \emph{independent} of the number of watermarked content collected by the attacker, provided they cannot easily distinguish watermarks from different keys. Our scheme does not further degrade model utility. We randomize the watermark key selection for each query and accept content as genuine only if a watermark is detected by \emph{exactly} one key. We focus on the image and text modalities, but our defense is modality-agnostic, since it treats the underlying watermarking method as a black-box. Our method provably bounds the attacker's success rate and we empirically observe a reduction from near-perfect success rates to only $2\%$ at negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Existing methods typically address either aleatoric uncertainty due to measurement noise or epistemic uncertainty resulting from limited data, but not both in a balanced manner. We propose CLEAR, a calibration method with two distinct parameters, $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$, to combine the two uncertainty components and improve the conditional coverage of predictive intervals for regression tasks. CLEAR is compatible with any pair of aleatoric and epistemic estimators; we show how it can be used with (i) quantile regression for aleatoric uncertainty and (ii) ensembles drawn from the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for epistemic uncertainty. Across 17 diverse real-world datasets, CLEAR achieves an average improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in the interval width compared to the two individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage. Similar improvements are observed when applying CLEAR to Deep Ensembles (epistemic) and Simultaneous Quantile Regression (aleatoric). The benefits are especially evident in scenarios dominated by high aleatoric or epistemic uncertainty.

<title>Function Induction and Task Generalization: An Interpretability Study with Off-by-One Addition</title>

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3, 2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1 function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8 addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

<title>Comprehension Without Competence: Architectural Limits of LLMs in Symbolic Computation and Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

<title>DuetGraph: Coarse-to-Fine Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Dual-Pathway Global-Local Fusion</title>

arXiv:2507.11229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways, preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination. In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a 1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/USTC-DataDarknessLab/DuetGraph.git.

<title>MetaLint: Generalizable Idiomatic Code Quality Analysis through Instruction-Following and Easy-to-Hard Generalization</title>

arXiv:2507.11687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, an instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train models on static code quality conventions, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on synthetic linter-generated data with dynamic conventions to support easy-to-hard generalization, enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining. To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize. Our results show that MetaLint training improves generalization to unseen idioms. Qwen3-4B attains a 70.37% F-score on a manually curated and challenging PEP idiom detection benchmark, achieving the highest recall (70.43%) among all evaluated models. For localization, it reaches 26.73%, which is a strong outcome for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art models such as o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality analysis. Furthermore, MetaLint training enables generalization in idiom detection across model families, model scales, synthetic data from diverse linters, and Java idioms, demonstrating the general applicability of our approach. We plan to release our code and data to enable reproducibility and further work.

Abstract: We present BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in quantum architecture search (QAS) across a spectrum of variational quantum algorithm tasks on 2- to 8-qubit systems. Our study systematically evaluates 9 different RL agents, including both value-based and policy-gradient methods, on quantum problems such as variational eigensolver, quantum state diagonalization, variational quantum classification (VQC), and state preparation, under both noiseless and noisy execution settings. To ensure fair comparison, we propose a weighted ranking metric that integrates accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and training time. Results demonstrate that no single RL method dominates universally, the performance dependents on task type, qubit count, and noise conditions providing strong evidence of no free lunch principle in RL-QAS. As a byproduct we observe that a carefully chosen RL algorithm in RL-based VQC outperforms baseline VQCs. BenchRL-QAS establishes the most extensive benchmark for RL-based QAS to date, codes and experimental made publicly available for reproducibility and future advances.

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2 outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks, including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training data to support future work on LLM safety.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

arXiv:2507.17506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree, enabling scalable and efficient planning.
  Departing from uniform power allocation, which is often suboptimal with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), our approach predicts each target's future angular position and expected received power based on its expected range. These predictions guide adaptive waveform design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring sufficient power for high-SNR targets.
  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive, efficient multi-target radar systems.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials have become an indispensable tool for materials science, enabling the study of larger systems and longer timescales. State-of-the-art models are generally graph neural networks that employ message passing to iteratively update atomic embeddings that are ultimately used for predicting properties. In this work we extend the message passing formalism with the inclusion of a continuous variable that accounts for fractional atomic existence. This allows us to calculate the gradient of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the Cartesian coordinates of atoms and their existence. Using this we propose a gradient-based grand canonical optimization method and document its capabilities for a Cu(110) surface oxide.

Abstract: Recent ObjectNav systems credit large language models (LLMs) for sizable zero-shot gains, yet it remains unclear how much comes from language versus geometry. We revisit this question by re-evaluating an instruction-guided pipeline, InstructNav, under a detector-controlled setting and introducing two training-free variants that only alter the action value map: a geometry-only Frontier Proximity Explorer (FPE) and a lightweight Semantic-Heuristic Frontier (SHF) that polls the LLM with simple frontier votes. Across HM3D and MP3D, FPE matches or exceeds the detector-controlled instruction follower while using no API calls and running faster; SHF attains comparable accuracy with a smaller, localized language prior. These results suggest that carefully engineered frontier geometry accounts for much of the reported progress, and that language is most reliable as a light heuristic rather than an end-to-end planner.

<title>Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention</title>

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is ever-increasing, yet the quadratic complexity of standard self-attention presents a significant bottleneck. While existing sparse attention mechanisms enhance efficiency, they often suffer from limitations such as static patterns and information loss. This paper introduces a Trainable Dynamic Mask Sparse Attention mechanism that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, it leverages value vectors to dynamically generate content-aware sparse masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and focus on crucial information. Second, it implements a position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we ensure that the introduced dynamic masks and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, thereby supporting end-to-end training. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to retain complete information while significantly reducing computational complexity, achieving an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. We validate the performance of Dynamic Mask Attention through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies demonstrate that our method consistently achieves Pareto dominance across various tasks, including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, general benchmarks, and needle-in-a-haystack tests, delivering up to 10 times acceleration. These results highlight its capability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling. Our computational kernel is open-sourced at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to facilitate further research and application within the community.

<title>Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models</title>

Abstract: Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end, with agents generating messages and actions concurrently. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), to simulate future states. Agents then communicate a summary of this plan. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.

Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs' capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) precise search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on diverse long-context benchmarks demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool-calling and instruction-following capabilities. To further optimize these strategies, we introduce a novel dynamic context-aware reinforcement learning (RL) approach, advancing the training of an agent that actively modifies its own conversational history. By enabling Active Context Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies, rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ) dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8 categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation, (ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and (iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low resource settings.

<title>BLADE: Block-Sparse Attention Meets Step Distillation for Efficient Video Generation</title>

arXiv:2508.10774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention (ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware step distillation paradigm, built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than treating it as a separate compression step and features fast convergence. We validate BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B, and our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a 50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from 0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) estimates a dynamical system's state from noisy observations. Recent generative models like the ensemble score filter (EnSF) improve DA in high-dimensional nonlinear settings but are computationally expensive. We introduce the ensemble flow filter (EnFF), a training-free, flow matching (FM)-based framework that accelerates sampling and offers flexibility in flow design. EnFF uses Monte Carlo estimators for the marginal flow field, localized guidance for observation assimilation, and utilizes a novel flow that exploits the Bayesian DA formulation. It generalizes classical filters such as the bootstrap particle filter and ensemble Kalman filter. Experiments on high-dimensional benchmarks demonstrate EnFF's improved cost-accuracy tradeoffs and scalability, highlighting FM's potential for efficient, scalable DA. Code is available at https://github.com/Utah-Math-Data-Science/Data-Assimilation-Flow-Matching.

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in audio, vision and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling with arbitrary sampling rates-covering acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel foundation model ECHO that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with frequency positional embeddings, enabling spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations. Moreover, the model incorporates sliding patches to support inputs of variable length without padding or cropping, producing a concise embedding that retains both temporal and spectral fidelity and naturally extends to streaming scenarios. We evaluate our method on various kinds of machine signal datasets, including previous DCASE task 2 challenges (2020-2025), and widely-used industrial signal corpora. Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in machine signal anomaly detection and fault classification, confirming the effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on https://github.com/yucongzh/ECHO.

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a functional agentic AI framework for building LLM-based structured data workflow pipelines. Designed for both research and practical applications, Agentics offers a new data-centric paradigm in which agents are embedded within data types, enabling logical transduction between structured states. This design shifts the focus toward principled data modeling, providing a declarative language where data types are directly exposed to large language models and composed through transductions triggered by type connections. We present a range of structured data workflow tasks and empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach, including data wrangling, text-to-SQL semantic parsing, and domain-specific multiple-choice question answering.

Abstract: Airborne Base Stations (ABSs) allow for flexible geographical allocation of network resources with dynamically changing load as well as rapid deployment of alternate connectivity solutions during natural disasters. Since the radio infrastructure is carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with limited flight time, it is important to establish the best location for the ABS without exhaustive field trials. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT)-guided approach to achieve this through the following key contributions: (i) Implementation of an interactive software bridge between two open-source DTs such that the same scene is evaluated with high fidelity across NVIDIA's Sionna and Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin (AODT), highlighting the unique features of each of these platforms for this allocation problem, (ii) Design of a back-propagation-based algorithm in Sionna for rapidly converging on the physical location of the UAVs, orientation of the antennas and transmit power to ensure efficient coverage across the swarm of the UAVs, and (iii) numerical evaluation in AODT for large network scenarios (50 UEs, 10 ABS) that identifies the environmental conditions in which there is agreement or divergence of performance results between these twins. Finally, (iv) we propose a resilience mechanism to provide consistent coverage to mission-critical devices and demonstrate a use case for bi-directional flow of information between the two DTs.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3) designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models, such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B total and 2.2B activated parameters.

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained, controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/SpotEdit.

Whisper showed better performance in deeper layers. Additionally, we determined the optimal number of transformer layers for each model when fine-tuned for speaker identification tasks.

Abstract: Converting natural language queries into SQL queries is a crucial challenge in both industry and academia, aiming to increase access to databases and large-scale applications. This work examines how in-context learning and chain-of-thought can be utilized to develop a robust solution for text-to-SQL systems. We propose SQL-of-Thought: a multi-agent framework that decomposes the Text2SQL task into schema linking, subproblem identification, query plan generation, SQL generation, and a guided correction loop. Unlike prior systems that rely only on execution-based static correction, we introduce taxonomy-guided dynamic error modification informed by in-context learning. SQL-of-Thought achieves state-of-the-art results on the Spider dataset and its variants, combining guided error taxonomy with reasoning-based query planning.

<title>Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are critical for societal planning and disaster preparedness. Yet these forecasts remain challenging to produce and evaluate, especially in regions with sparse observational coverage. Current evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) weather prediction relies primarily on reanalyses, which can obscure important deficiencies. Here we present MAUSAM (Measuring AI Uncertainty during South Asian Monsoon), an evaluation of seven leading AI-based forecasting systems - FourCastNet, FourCastNet-SFNO, Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, Aurora, AIFS, and GenCast - during the South Asian Monsoon, using ground-based weather stations, rain gauge networks, and geostationary satellite imagery. The AI models demonstrate impressive forecast skill during monsoon across a broad range of variables, ranging from large-scale surface temperature and winds to precipitation, cloud cover, and subseasonal to seasonal eddy statistics, highlighting the strength of data-driven weather prediction. However, the models still exhibit systematic errors at finer scales like the underprediction of extreme precipitation, divergent cyclone tracks, and the mesoscale kinetic energy spectra, highlighting avenues for future improvement. A comparison against observations reveals forecast errors up to 15-45% larger than those relative to reanalysis and traditional forecasts, indicating that reanalysis-centric benchmarks can overstate forecast skill. Of the models assessed, AIFS achieves the most consistent representation of atmospheric variables, with GraphCast and GenCast also showing strong skill. The analysis presents a framework for evaluating AI weather models on regional prediction and highlights both the promise and current limitations of AI weather prediction in data-sparse regions, underscoring the importance of observational evaluation for future operational adoption.

<title>Do LLMs Adhere to Label Definitions? Examining Their Receptivity to External Label Definitions</title>

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Abstract: In this study we develop dimension-reduction techniques to accelerate diffusion model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models (hence, CSDM): First, compress the dataset into a latent space (from an ambient space), and train a diffusion model in the latent space; next, apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent space for decoding back to the original space; and the goal is to facilitate the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under certain sparsity assumptions on data, our proposed approach achieves provably faster convergence, via combining diffusion model inference with sparse recovery. It also sheds light on the best choice of the latent space dimension. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we run numerical experiments on a range of datasets, including handwritten digits, medical and climate images, and financial time series for stress testing.

Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.

<title>The Physical Basis of Prediction: World Model Formation in Neural Organoids via an LLM-Generated Curriculum</title>

Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.

<title>Hierarchical Task Environments as the Next Frontier for Embodied World Models in Robot Soccer</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in agent development have focused on scaling model size and raw interaction data, mirroring the successes seen in large language models. However, for complex, long-horizon multi-agent tasks such as robotic soccer, this end-to-end approach often fails due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in developing embodied world models is not merely increasing the fidelity or size of environments, but scaling their structural complexity through explicit hierarchical scaffolding. We posit that an effective world model for decision-making must model not only the world's physics but also its task semantics. Drawing from a systematic review of 2024 research in low-resource multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear trend towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods, such as Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) and Bayesian Strategy Networks (BSNs), with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). These methods decompose complex goals into manageable subgoals, creating an intrinsic curriculum that shapes agent learning. We propose that such structured environments are essential for bridging the gap between simple, reactive behaviors and sophisticated, strategic team play. We further extend this principle, proposing that this scaffolding can be generalized to other complex domains and dynamically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which act as generative world models of tasks. By building environments with explicit, composable task layers, we can guide agent exploration more efficiently, generate meaningful learning signals, and ultimately train more capable and general-purpose agents with fewer resources than purely end-to-end approaches.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to create a standard for how Large Language Models use tools. However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application. The code is public at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/Code2MCP.

Abstract: Recent progress in aligning image and video generative models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has improved human preference alignment, but existing variants remain inefficient due to sequential rollouts and large numbers of sampling steps, unreliable credit assignment: sparse terminal rewards are uniformly propagated across timesteps, failing to capture the varying criticality of decisions during denoising. In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO. Codes are available at \href{https://fredreic1849.github.io/BranchGRPO-Webpage/}{BranchGRPO}.

Abstract: Making large language models (LLMs) more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale. Pruning is a promising technique, but existing pruning methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout, requiring custom inference code, while depth pruning can cause abrupt accuracy drops. Also, while many pruning approaches are effective against LLMs, they struggle to maintain performance on small language models (SLMs). In this work, we propose COMPACT, which jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/LM head layers and (ii) prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations, aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT inherits strengths of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab. vs. FFN pruning), competitive pruning times, and strong memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream performance, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and latency.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs), which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy. However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a range of downstream tasks.

<title>Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?</title>

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they can succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets may not be ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the knowledge of the target LLM whose activations are decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.

Abstract: Training agents to act in embodied environments typically requires vast training data or access to accurate simulation, neither of which exists for many cases in the real world. Instead, world models are emerging as an alternative leveraging offline, passively collected data, they make it possible to generate diverse worlds for training agents in simulation. In this work, we harness world models to generate imagined environments to train robust agents capable of generalizing to novel task variations. One of the challenges in doing this is ensuring the agent trains on useful generated data. We thus propose a novel approach, IMAC (Imagined Autocurricula), leveraging Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), which induces an automatic curriculum over generated worlds. In a series of challenging, procedurally generated environments, we show it is possible to achieve strong transfer performance on held-out environments, having trained only inside a world model learned from a narrower dataset. We believe this opens the path to utilizing larger-scale, foundation world models for generally capable agents.

Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving. The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.

Abstract: Lane-change maneuvers are a leading cause of highway accidents, underscoring the need for accurate intention prediction to improve the safety and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. While prior studies using machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers) have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification, lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway, time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models, particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD, and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon, outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.

Summary: 
Distributional Test-time Adaptation (DOTA) is proposed to address the limitations of existing cache-based test-time adapters for vision-language models like CLIP. DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of test data and computes test-time posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach allows the model to adapt to deployment environments and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. DOTA outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. Experiment results validate the effectiveness of DOTA in improving reliability and reducing the cost associated with fine-tuning VLMs. Overall, DOTA offers a simple yet effective solution for enhancing the performance and adaptability of vision-language models in real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Summary:
Two graph neural network-based methods are proposed to tackle multi-objective routing on multigraphs. The first approach involves autoregressively selecting edges in the multigraph until a tour is completed. The second model simplifies the multigraph through a learned pruning strategy before performing autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. Both models are evaluated empirically across various problems and graph distributions, showing competitive performance against strong heuristics and neural baselines. This research addresses the existing gap in routing methods for multigraphs and showcases the effectiveness of graph neural networks in solving multi-objective routing problems. <div>

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. Yet, existing methods are unsuitable for routing on multigraphs, which feature multiple edges with distinct attributes between node pairs, despite their strong relevance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose two graph neural network-based methods to address multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach operates directly on the multigraph by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed. The second model, which is more scalable, first simplifies the multigraph via a learned pruning strategy and then performs autoregressive routing on the resulting simple graph. We evaluate both models empirically, across a wide range of problems and graph distributions, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to strong heuristics and neural baselines.

Summary: <br />
GraphIDS is a novel self-supervised intrusion detection model that combines representation learning and anomaly detection for network traffic. By using a masked autoencoder to learn local graph representations of normal communication patterns, GraphIDS captures typical network behavior. The model utilizes an inductive graph neural network to embed each flow with its local topological context and a Transformer-based encoder-decoder to reconstruct these embeddings, learning global co-occurrence patterns through self-attention. During inference, flows with high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions.

Abstract: Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.

Summary:
The article introduces the Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model as a solution for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. It addresses the limitations of Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons by incorporating a multi-dendritic and soma architecture inspired by biological neurons. Each dendritic branch in the model encodes specific frequency bands, enhancing frequency representation. An adaptive threshold mechanism in the soma structure adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes and maintaining training efficiency.

Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons, thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity, reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling on edge platforms.

Abstract: Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the diminishing returns from offline data. In comparison, reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still, training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems.
  We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world. In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks, pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.

Summary:
This paper presents a new method for analyzing food retail processes to reduce food waste. The approach combines object-centric process mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. Initially, a continuous-time Markov chain is derived from sales data to model customer behavior. This model is then expanded to incorporate supply activities, creating a comprehensive view of the entire process. By conducting what-if analyses, the optimal balance between customer demand and supply strategies can be determined. This helps in preventing food waste resulting from oversupply as well as avoiding product shortages. The integration of OCPM and stochastic processes provides a unique approach to addressing food waste issues in the retail sector. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and product shortages.

Summary: 
Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach to solving PDEs, but are sensitive to loss weight selection. The study proposes two-dimensional analysis-based weighting schemes, one relying on quantifiable terms and another incorporating unquantifiable terms for balanced training. Benchmark tests on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid-driven cavity flows demonstrate the superiority of the second scheme in enhancing stability and accuracy over equal weighting. Particularly in high Peclet number convection diffusion scenarios, where traditional solvers struggle, PINNs utilizing the new weighting scheme exhibit stable and precise predictions, underscoring their robustness and versatility in solving CFD problems. <br /> <br /> <div>

We propose two dimensional analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD problems.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as agents for experimental design, but a study found that they lack sensitivity to experimental feedback. The study evaluated open- and closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs in genetic perturbation and molecular property discovery tasks, finding that LLM-based agents did not improve performance when true outcomes were replaced with random labels. Classical methods like linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently outperformed LLM agents. A hybrid method, LLMNN, combining LLM knowledge with nearest-neighbor sampling, achieved competitive or superior results across domains without needing significant adaptation. The study suggests that current LLMs struggle with in-context experimental design, highlighting the importance of hybrid frameworks that separate prior-based reasoning from acquiring updated posteriors.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

<div> NUFILT, Data-free continual model merging, transparency, fidelity, null-space filtering, LoRA adapter

Summary:
NUFILT proposes a data-free framework for continual model merging, focusing on transparency and fidelity. By leveraging task vectors aligned with representation subspaces, NUFILT ensures transparency by filtering out overlapping components of new tasks and maintains fidelity by using a lightweight LoRA adapter to inject task-specific signals. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain consistency while introducing novel directions. The backbone can absorb new knowledge while preserving existing behaviors, and updates are fused back in a layer-wise linear fashion without additional parameters or inference cost. Theoretical guarantees for approximate subspace alignment justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT outperforms existing approaches on vision and NLP benchmarks, achieving minimal forgetting, narrowing the gap with fine-tuning, and reducing computation overhead. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost. Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks, improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Summary: This work addresses the challenge of interpreting black box models used in low-resource tabular problems by proposing the use of reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees. By leveraging prior knowledge and learning from data, these LLMs create lightweight decision trees that outperform traditional CART models. While not matching the performance of black box models, decision trees offer a human-readable reasoning trace that can be analyzed for biases and data leaks. The creation process allows for additional human input, enabling corrections of biases and incorporation of domain-specific intuition not captured in the data. This approach provides a promising alternative for improving interpretability and incorporating expert knowledge in model development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input: correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not captured in the data.

<br />
Summary: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new type of generative models based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. While IGNs support single and multi-step generation, conventional models can suffer from training instabilities and mode collapse. In contrast, diffusion and score-based models offer stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality but come with a high computational cost. The proposed method, SIGN, distills idempotent models from pre-trained diffusion model scores, providing a stable and efficient alternative to iterative generation models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, with the ability to project alternate distributions back onto the target manifold for zero-shot editing. Empirical validation on image datasets shows SIGNs achieve state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on CIFAR and CelebA datasets. <div>
arXiv:2509.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores, called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Summary: 
Hallucinations in generative models are formalized as failures to connect an estimate to a plausible cause, leading to estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Even optimal estimators that minimize loss still exhibit hallucinations. A general high probability lower bound exists on the rate of hallucinations for generic data distributions. This reframing of hallucinations highlights a structural misalignment between loss minimization and outputs deemed acceptable by humans. Experimental results on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image tasks support the theoretical framework presented. <div>

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation. We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and MATH500).

Summary:
A new high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark, KD48, has been developed to address the challenge of reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics from incomplete surface observations. The benchmark is curated with expert-driven denoising and serves as a standardized, analysis-ready benchmark for Earth science research. A novel reconstruction paradigm, VISION, based on Dynamic Prompting has been introduced to tackle missing data in real-world observations. VISION generates visual prompts on-the-fly from available observations to guide adaptive adjustment strategies in a universal backbone model. The State-conditioned Prompting module efficiently injects prompts, enabling VISION to handle challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark show that VISION outperforms existing models and exhibits strong generalization in extreme data missing scenarios. The work provides a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty. <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields, from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising. Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research under data uncertainty.

Summary: 
The paper introduces conformal data augmentation as a method to generate diverse synthetic data while controlling bias. This framework leverages conformal prediction to filter out poor-quality generations, ensuring provable risk control without requiring access to model logits or extensive retraining. The approach is demonstrated to be effective in various tasks including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection. Results show consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score compared to unaugmented baselines and 4% over other filtered augmentation methods. <div>

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications, synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical: effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection, showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

<div> distributed learning, gradient-free zero-order optimization, FedZero, convex setting, high-probability guarantees

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on distributed learning in the context of gradient-free zero-order optimization, presenting FedZero as a federated zero-order algorithm with strong theoretical guarantees. FedZero achieves near-optimal error bounds with high probability in the federated convex setting and introduces high-probability convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization in the single-worker regime. The algorithm utilizes a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere. New concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere with explicit constants are developed to analyze FedZero. These concentration tools are crucial for the high-probability guarantees and have potential independent applications. <div>

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere. To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

<div> Fourier neural operators, reservoir systems, subsurface fluid flow, neural operator architecture, computational experiments<br />
<br />Summary: This paper introduces a neural operator architecture, TFNO-opt, for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems. Traditional numerical methods for such systems are time-consuming, limiting their applicability in control and decision support. The TFNO-opt architecture utilizes Fourier neural operators to approximate solutions in functional spaces, improving accuracy and stability for control problems. Modifications such as adjustable time resolution, tensor decomposition, and error function enhancements enhance accuracy and computational efficiency. Computational experiments show a six-order-of-magnitude acceleration compared to traditional methods in hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage problem. This advancement opens new opportunities for effectively controlling complex reservoir systems. <div>
arXiv:2509.21485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture (TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex reservoir systems.

Summary: 
GraphPFN is a novel approach for node-level prediction on graph data, utilizing a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs generated using stochastic block models and preferential attachment processes. By incorporating graph-aware structured causal models and training on synthetic graphs sampled from the prior, the model, based on LimiX, captures complex graph structural dependencies. It outperforms existing models like G2T-FM and task-specific GNNs on real-world datasets of up to 50,000 nodes after fine-tuning. This work highlights the effectiveness of pretraining on well-designed synthetic graphs to build robust graph foundation models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However, these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior, allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes, GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation models.

<div> compression, diffusion models, SlimDiff, activation-informed, spectral approximation

Summary:
SlimDiff is a new automated compression framework for diffusion models (DMs) that reduces both attention and feedforward dimensionalities without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. The framework leverages activation covariances across denoising timesteps to guide dynamic pruning, achieving up to 35% acceleration and around 100 million parameter reduction compared to baselines. SlimDiff reframes compression as a spectral approximation task, decomposing functional weight groups to adaptively allocate sparsity and respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. This approach maintains generation quality on par with uncompressed models, requiring only 500 calibration samples, significantly fewer than previous methods. SlimDiff is the first training-free, activation-guided structural compression method for DMs, providing both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2509.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization, timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement fine-tuning, reward over-optimization, rubric-based rewards, off-policy examples, LLM post-training improvements <br />
Summary: 
Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often faces reward over-optimization, caused by a lack of distinction between Excellent and Great responses. To address this, the focus is shifted to the high-reward tail region. However, tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. Off-policy exemplars offer a solution but training on them may lead to a misalignment of rewards. A solution proposed is rubric-based rewards, utilizing off-policy examples while being insensitive to artifacts. The importance of distinguishing diverse responses is emphasized, and a workflow is introduced for implementation. Empirical evidence shows that rubric-based rewards effectively mitigate reward over-optimization and enhance LLM post-training results. The code is available at https://github.com/Jun-Kai-Zhang/rubrics.git. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones. This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements.

<div> Keywords: cMIM, representation learning, contrastive objective, mutual information, discriminative tasks

Summary: 
The article introduces the contrastive Mutual Information Machine (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) by adding a contrastive objective to enhance representation learning. cMIM addresses the challenge of transferring representations to diverse downstream tasks by balancing generative fidelity with discriminative capabilities. The framework does not require positive data augmentation and is less sensitive to batch size compared to InfoNCE. Additionally, the concept of informative embeddings is introduced to extract enriched features from encoder-decoder models, boosting discriminative performance without extra training. Empirical evidence across vision and molecular benchmarks shows that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE in classification and regression tasks while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality. These findings establish cMIM as a comprehensive framework for representation learning that efficiently serves both generative and discriminative applications. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms -- contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders -- balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE. Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning, advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative applications effectively.

Summary: <br />
DistillKac is a fast image generator utilizing the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. Unlike diffusion models, Kac dynamics ensure globally bounded kinetic energy and finite speed transport. The system introduces classifier-free guidance in velocity space while maintaining square integrability. Endpoint distillation trains a student model to match a frozen teacher over extended periods, with a stability result ensuring consistency along the entire path. Experimental results confirm that DistillKac generates high-quality samples with minimal function evaluations, while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows. <div>

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on improving Knowledge Tracing (KT) models by incorporating predictive uncertainty to detect student errors more effectively, particularly when students choose distractors. The research shows that a higher predictive uncertainty in KT models corresponds to incorrect predictions, making it a valuable signal for identifying student misconceptions. This uncertainty can aid in enhancing pedagogical strategies in educational platforms, especially in resource-constrained environments where understanding student abilities is crucial. The approach presented offers a promising avenue for refining KT models and improving their usefulness in educational settings. <div>

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor, leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions. We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student ability is necessary.

<div> grokking, delayed generalization, $\mathbf{Li_2$, 2-layer nonlinear networks, backpropagated gradient <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework, $\mathbf{Li_2$, to explain the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks. It identifies three key stages: Lazy learning, independent feature learning, and interactive feature learning, based on the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$. In Lazy learning, the top layer overfits to random hidden representation. Independent feature learning sees each hidden node learning its representation independently, following the gradient ascent of an energy function and forming local maxima as emerging features. The study assesses the generalizability and representation power of these features in group arithmetic tasks. Interactive feature learning explores how hidden nodes interact and adapt to focus on missing features. The analysis delves into the impact of hyperparameters on grokking, providing scaling laws for memorization and generalization and explaining the effectiveness of recent optimizers like Muon from gradient dynamics principles. It also hints at possible extensions to multi-layer architectures. <div>
arXiv:2509.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$ across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

Summary:
The article introduces TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework for semi-supervised learning (SSL). Unlike existing approaches, TRiCo incorporates a teacher, two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm. Pseudo-labels are selected based on mutual information for a more robust measure of uncertainty. TRiCo formulates SSL as a structured interaction among the teacher, students, and generator in a Stackelberg game framework. The teacher adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing, while the generator perturbs embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. TRiCo addresses limitations in existing SSL frameworks, providing state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes. It is architecture-agnostic, compatible with frozen vision backbones, and offers a principled and generalizable solution for SSL. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TRiCo in enhancing SSL performance.

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher, two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm. Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with frozen vision backbones.

Summary: 
The paper introduces BRT-Align, a framework for ensuring safety in large language models (LLMs) during inference. By modeling autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and using backward reachability to estimate the worst-case trajectory evolution, BRT-Align enables early detection of unsafe completions and minimally perturbs generation to avoid unsafe regions. Experimental results show that BRT-Align outperforms baseline methods in detecting and preventing unsafe content while maintaining sentence diversity and coherence. The framework effectively reduces the generation of violent, profane, offensive, and politically biased responses, showcasing its alignment properties. BRT-Align offers a principled and practical solution for enhancing safety in LLMs at inference time, addressing concerns about harmful content generation. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Data augmentation is a common technique used to enhance model performance by generating synthetic examples for training datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like healthcare, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation poses risks of producing inaccurate or misleading information. To address this challenge, a novel query-based model collaboration framework was introduced in this study. By incorporating expert domain knowledge into the augmentation process, the framework guides the generation of synthetic data to preserve critical medical information. Experimental results on clinical prediction tasks showed that the collaboration-based approach outperformed existing LLM augmentation methods consistently, while also reducing factual errors and improving safety. This framework bridges the gap between the potential of LLM augmentation and the safety requirements of specialized domains. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

In this work, we propose a novel query-based model collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety requirements of specialized domains.

<div> induction heads, large language models, in-context learning, transformer language models, token sequences<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at in-context learning, leveraging induction heads to support this ability in Transformer Language Models. These heads facilitate prediction by making tokens attend to past instances of the same token in the input. However, for more complex hierarchical patterns, such as those found in natural language, a more adaptive approach is needed. In a synthetic in-context learning task, it was observed that uniform attention to all successor tokens is insufficient for accurate predictions. LLMs with adaptive induction heads were found to excel in predicting future tokens by learning to attend to the relevant context. The study also revealed that induction heads learn in-context by identifying latent contexts that determine token transition relationships. This complete mechanistic account sheds light on how LLMs can predict higher-order repetitive patterns effectively in-context. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens. Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns. However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner, they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens. Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals, our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities, suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive abilities.

Summary:
The book explores the process of selection in learning, whether natural or artificial, emphasizing the role of statistical tools in controlling uncertainty. It discusses concentration of measure inequalities to manage the deviation of empirical estimates from true expectations. Various inequalities are covered, such as Markov's, Chebyshev's, and Hoeffding's. The book then delves into offline supervised learning, offering tools for deriving generalization bounds like Occam's razor and PAC-Bayesian analysis. Further, it applies these concepts to online learning, examining regret in stochastic and adversarial environments. Performance measures in online learning are defined by regret, comparing algorithm performance to the best prediction rule retrospectively. Tools for deriving regret bounds are presented for different feedback types, including bandit feedback. Overall, the book provides a comprehensive overview of statistical methods in the context of machine learning and selection under uncertainty.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy, leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's, Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl. We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor, Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and bandit feedback.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the Gumbel Dynamical Model (GDM) as a solution to the limitations of traditional switching dynamical systems in capturing smooth and variable-speed transitions in time series data. By introducing a continuous relaxation of discrete states and a noise model based on the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the available state dynamics, allowing for a more faithful approximation of non-stationary ground-truth dynamics. The model is fully differentiable, enabling efficient training with standard gradient descent methods. GDM has been validated on simulation datasets, showcasing its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions in a stochastic setting. Additionally, GDM has been applied to real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in inferring interpretable states in stochastic time series with multiple dynamics, a task where traditional methods often struggle. <div>

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often fail.

Summary: 
This paper introduces GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to uncertainty quantification in operator learning. The method avoids constructing a likelihood by utilizing a generative hyper-network model to generate parameter distributions consistent with observed data. GenUQ outperforms other uncertainty quantification methods in various example problems, including recovering a manufactured operator, learning a solution operator for a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling failure locations of porous steel under tension. This approach opens up new possibilities for integrating uncertainty quantification into operator models without relying on likelihood-based methods, showing promising results in various applications such as sea ice modeling, combustion, and atmospheric physics. <div>
arXiv:2509.21605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling. Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Summary: <br />
Federated continual learning (FCL) is a challenging task due to catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity in decentralized settings. FedProTIP addresses this issue by projecting client updates to reduce interference with previously learned representations. This helps in preserving performance across tasks in a task sequence. Additionally, a lightweight mechanism is incorporated in FedProTIP to predict task identity and adjust the global model's outputs dynamically. Experimental results show that FedProTIP outperforms existing methods in average accuracy, especially in scenarios where task identities are unknown. <div>
arXiv:2509.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model. This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a priori unknown.

<div> causal abstractions, low-level model, high-level model, lossy representations, high-dimensional image settings

Summary:
Projected abstractions are introduced as a new type of abstractions that generalize existing definitions to accommodate lossy representations. These abstractions bridge complex low-level causal models with simple high-level ones and handle situations where multiple low-level interventions can lead to the same high-level intervention. A graphical criteria is proposed for identifying and estimating high-level causal queries from limited low-level data when the true model is unknown. The study demonstrates how to construct a projected abstraction from the low-level model and translate observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to high-level. The effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image settings is experimentally shown. <div>
arXiv:2509.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image settings.

<div> SVD, activation compression, on-device learning, continual learning, low-rank subspace  
Summary:  
LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression) introduces a framework for efficient on-device learning by utilizing one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce memory and computational costs. By obtaining a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection, LANCE eliminates the need for repeated decompositions and allows for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices. The fixed low-rank subspaces enable allocation of tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experimental results demonstrate that LANCE significantly reduces activation storage while maintaining high accuracy on various datasets. In continual learning benchmarks, LANCE achieves competitive performance with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. This makes LANCE a practical and scalable solution for efficient on-device learning in resource-constrained environments.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

Summary: 
Training large models with millions to billions of parameters is resource-intensive but most learning occurs early in training, stabilizing over time to a low intrinsic rank. This study proposes switching from full parameter training to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) based on the level of convergence in the ViT-Large model. By defining user-specific hyperparameters and assigning ranks to module layers, the approach reduces trainable parameters to 10% of the original size. Results show a 3x improvement in throughput, 1.5x reduction in training time per epoch, and a 20% decrease in GPU memory consumption. This method maintains model accuracy while optimizing computational efficiency and memory usage.

arXiv:2509.21619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank. Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence. Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size, resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method for predicting molecular Hessians in computational chemistry using deep learning. Traditional methods for calculating Hessians are computationally expensive and scale poorly with system size. The proposed method, known as HIP (Hessian Interaction Prediction), utilizes SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations features during message passing in graph neural networks. By directly predicting the Hessians, HIP is significantly faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, and easier to train. It also demonstrates improved performance in tasks such as transition state search, geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis. The authors have made the HIP codebase and model weights available on GitHub for further development. <div>

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization, zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

<div> Keywords: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning, heterogeneous reasoning transformations, low-rank adaptation, Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation, blockwise design<br />
Summary: 
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods need to be both resource-efficient and capable of handling various reasoning transformations. Classical low-rank adaptation methods are limited by a fixed rank, while Hadamard-style extensions like HiRA can raise the rank but are constrained by global modulation. ABBA trades off this constraint for fully learned dense intermediates. In response to the limitations of global modulation, Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA) partitions weight matrices, allowing for HiRA-style modulation within each block independently. This approach maintains a rich spectrum across different rank budgets, preventing collapse induced by global modulation. Through empirical analyses on multiple tasks, including common sense reasoning and arithmetic benchmarks, BHRA consistently outperforms strong parameter-efficient fine-tuning baselines with matched parameter budgets.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA), which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets, mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched parameter budgets.

Summary: Mask-based pretraining has been widely used in various fields such as language, vision, and biology, but its underlying mechanisms have been unclear. This study proposes a theoretical framework based on high-dimensional minimum-norm linear regression to analyze the behavior of mask-based pretraining. The analysis reveals that a simple pretraining scheme called Randomly Random Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE) can outperform traditional masking methods by capturing multi-scale features from the data. The framework has been validated on different neural architectures and tasks, leading to improvements in state-of-the-art models. The code for R$^2$MAE is publicly available, providing a new approach to improve the performance of large-scale models. <div>
arXiv:2509.21650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success, its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less") linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers) applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for state-of-the-art models.

- A fundamental incompatibility between safety, trust, and AGI is demonstrated within the proposed definitions.
- Safety is defined as the property of never making false claims, trust as assuming the system is safe, and AGI as exceeding human capability.

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict, mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification, planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's results.

Summary: The article introduces DriftLite, a lightweight and training-free particle-based method for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to new target distributions without retraining. By leveraging an unexplored degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation, DriftLite offers Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG) to optimize drift with minimal computational overhead. This approach ensures optimal stability control during inference dynamics, outperforming existing guidance-based methods that introduce bias and particle-based corrections prone to weight degeneracy and high computational costs. DriftLite demonstrates consistent improvements in sample quality and variance reduction across Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand co-folding problems, highlighting its effectiveness in scalable inference-time adaptation of diffusion models. <div>

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining. Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance (VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time adaptation of diffusion models.

<div> differentiable structure learning, discrete data, dependencies, identifiability, optimization

Summary:
The article introduces a differentiable structure learning framework for discrete data that can capture arbitrary dependencies. Unlike existing methods, this framework does not assume data is generated from specific structural equation models, making it more widely applicable. The framework considers the complex dependence structure inherent in discrete data and allows for non-linear effects. It demonstrates that although general discrete models may be unidentifiable from observational data alone, the complete set of compatible parameters and structures can be characterized. Identifiability up to Markov equivalence is established under mild assumptions. The learning problem is formulated as a single differentiable optimization task in its most general form, avoiding the simplifications of previous methods. Empirical results show that this approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data. <div>

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore, current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures. Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models (LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by +11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

Summary:<br />Neurosymbolic integration, a field combining neural-network learning with symbolic reasoning, can be enhanced by Logic of Hypotheses (LoH). LoH introduces a choice operator to extend propositional logic syntax, enabling the integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic priors and expert knowledge.

The framework subsumes existing NeSy models and provides the flexibility for knowledge specification. By utilizing Goedel fuzzy logic and the Goedel trick, models can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without loss of performance. Experimental analysis on tabular data and Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task demonstrates the effectiveness and interpretability of decision rules generated by these models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands, enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models, while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification. Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models, showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task, while producing interpretable decision rules.

<div> Regularization, Deep Learning, Monotonicity, Overfitting, Predictive Performance <br />
<br />
This paper introduces a new regularization method called Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM) to address overfitting issues in deep learning models. The proposed method enforces monotonic relationships based on domain knowledge, penalizing deviations from expected trends relative to a linear baseline. By incorporating constraints on model behavior during training, DIM enhances predictive performance across various neural network architectures. The approach is formalized through a mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. Experimental results using real-world ridesourcing data from Chicago and synthetic datasets demonstrate that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently improve model performance. DIM proves to be an effective strategy for improving model generalization and mitigating the effects of overfitting in deep learning applications. <br />
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically, our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior and mitigate overfitting

Visit https://neuroprobe.dev/ for more information and access to the Neuroprobe toolkit. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.21671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe: a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions. First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models, Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at https://neuroprobe.dev/

SlotFM utilizes Time-Frequency Slot Attention to process time and frequency representations of signals, creating multiple embeddings to capture different signal components. Task-specific heads can then focus on relevant parts of the data. Two loss regularizers improve fine-grained detail reconstruction and help embeddings maintain task-relevant information. SlotFM outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 out of 16 tasks and achieves similar results on the remaining tasks. On average, the method demonstrates a 4.5% performance improvement, showcasing strong generalization capabilities for sensing foundation models. <div>

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong generalization for sensing foundation models.

Summary: 
This paper presents a new approach to solving the challenging $K$-means clustering problem by formulating it as a smooth unconstrained optimization over a submanifold. By characterizing its Riemannian structures, the problem can be solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. The $K$-means manifold is factorized into a product manifold, allowing each Newton subproblem to be solved in linear time. Through numerical experiments, the proposed method is shown to converge significantly faster than existing first-order methods while achieving optimal statistical accuracy. This approach addresses the difficulty of balancing constraint feasibility and objective optimality in current relaxation algorithms, providing a promising solution for cluster recovery challenges. <div>
arXiv:2509.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications, such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks, compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large vision-language models.

Summary:
SpecMER is introduced as a framework for protein sequence generation that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. It aims to address the limitations of speculative decoding in protein engineering by improving sequence plausibility and retaining efficiency. SpecMER scores candidate sequences in parallel and selects those most consistent with known biological patterns, enhancing the quality of generated sequences. Results show that SpecMER achieves a 24-32% speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance rates and improved sequence likelihoods. This novel approach combines the benefits of speculative decoding with the integration of biological constraints, leading to more biologically plausible and efficient protein sequence generation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However, their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32% speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling. Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the 0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research. Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad optimization technique.

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve transportation services and urban development.

Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems (LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for efficient and scalable computation.

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper- and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously. Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression. Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover, our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled longitudinal imaging data.

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently. To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels: trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular optimization.

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease detection tasks.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes. HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free learning.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single, unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably, unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability to settings with limited reference information.

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test [NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data (oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus (sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

<title>Beyond Formula Complexity: Effective Information Criterion Improves Performance and Interpretability for Symbolic Regression</title>

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system. We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts' preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's interpretability.

<title>FastGRPO: Accelerating Policy Optimization via Concurrency-aware Speculative Decoding and Online Draft Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck. Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration, its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels, thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/yedaotian9/GRPO_speculative.

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of fatigue monitoring systems.

<title>ChaosNexus: A Foundation Model for Universal Chaotic System Forecasting with Multi-scale Representations</title>

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries, semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses. Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers -- points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated minimizers.

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward challenges in online MARL.

<title>On the Complexity Theory of Masked Discrete Diffusion: From $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ to Nearly $\epsilon$-Free</title>

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1) overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with $\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU) approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of $O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the $\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based language models developed under masking paradigm.

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as $\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather than the ambient dimension.

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.

<title>Beyond RAG vs. Long-Context: Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval for Efficient Knowledge Grounding</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon; and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages, thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

<title>Abductive Logical Rule Induction by Bridging Inductive Logic Programming and Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs, which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.

<title>Zubov-Net: Adaptive Stability for Neural ODEs Reconciling Accuracy with Robustness</title>

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net, which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs (PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses (consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function. To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures. Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

<title>Position: The Hidden Costs and Measurement Gaps of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math, code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax, evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models, we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean, parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive: RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

<title>Why High-rank Neural Networks Generalize?: An Algebraic Framework with RKHSs</title>

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

<title>Closing the Oracle Gap: Increment Vector Transformation for Class Incremental Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21898</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC), we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding, we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths, IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<title>Discrete Guidance Matching: Exact Guidance for Discrete Flow Matching</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However, such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model, leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding tasks. The code is available through https://github.com/WanZhengyan/Discrete-Guidance-Matching/tree/main.

<title>Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models:Toward Joint Visualization of Interactive and Independent Effects</title>

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless, CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process. Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of predictive performance.

<title>Generation Properties of Stochastic Interpolation under Finite Training Set</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise. Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as classification support our theory.

<title>Extracting Actionable Insights from Building Energy Data using Vision LLMs on Wavelet and 3D Recurrence Representations</title>

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy analytics.

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation. Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear) remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

<title>Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion for Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the structural information gain of each state community and use it as a conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in computation. Our code is publicly available \href{https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/active_attacks}{here}.

<title>Think Smart, Not Hard: Difficulty Adaptive Reasoning for Large Audio Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT) paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a ``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm offers valuable insights for future work.

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements, when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral, but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction, diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it consistently improves both quality and diversity.

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL) agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch. In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning (SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically, the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications: (1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers. Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC (higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass, Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters. The code of this work will be released.

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures, our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning, we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and stochastic optimization.

<title>MCGM: Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling for Long-range Interactions in Molecules</title>

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry, yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance; physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead. We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures, MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features, reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

Abstract: Latent space is one of the key concepts in generative AI, offering powerful means for creative exploration through vector manipulation. However, diffusion models like Stable Diffusion lack the intuitive latent vector control found in GANs, limiting their flexibility for artistic expression. This paper introduces \workname, a framework for integrating customizable latent space operations into the diffusion process. By enabling direct manipulation of conceptual and spatial representations, this approach expands creative possibilities in generative art. We demonstrate the potential of this framework through two artworks, \textit{Infinitepedia} and \textit{Latent Motion}, highlighting its use in conceptual blending and dynamic motion generation. Our findings reveal latent space structures with semantic and meaningless regions, offering insights into the geometry of diffusion models and paving the way for further explorations of latent space.

arXiv:2509.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold, and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

arXiv:2509.22047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper, we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate MO-GRPO experimentally in four domains: (i) the multi-armed bandits problem, (ii) simulated control task (Mo-Gymnasium), (iii) machine translation tasks on the WMT benchmark (En-Ja, En-Zh), and (iv) instruction following task. MO-GRPO achieves stable learning by evenly distributing correlations among the components of rewards, outperforming GRPO, showing MO-GRPO to be a promising algorithm for multi-objective reinforcement learning problems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others, current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

<title>Enriching Knowledge Distillation with Intra-Class Contrastive Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22053</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively. Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness. To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch. Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to empirically validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite: steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply with harmful requests. Through extensive experiments on different model families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not guarantee precise control over model behavior.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing robust defense strategies.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a range of learning tasks. However, scaling GNNs to large graphs remains a significant challenge, especially for graph-level tasks. In this work, we introduce SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency and performance. We introduce an improved, data-driven strategy for selecting the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN. Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SHAKE-GNN achieves competitive performance while offering improved scalability.

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive, resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical recourse systems.

arXiv:2509.22111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics, continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete development.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

<title>Learning More with Less: A Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling Framework for Efficient Policy Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling (D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

arXiv:2509.22121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often unavailable.

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional $L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

arXiv:2509.22161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2) all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its $K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks, including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns.

<title>Efficiency Boost in Decentralized Optimization: Reimagining Neighborhood Aggregation with Minimal Overhead</title>

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies, demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for widespread integration.

<title>Learning Equivariant Functions via Quadratic Forms</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22184</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown) equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$ corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms, while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple. This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

<title>Mechanistic Independence: A Principle for Identifiable Disentangled Representations</title>

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution. This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework, we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components. Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

<title>Kernel Regression of Multi-Way Data via Tensor Trains with Hadamard Overparametrization: The Dynamic Graph Flow Case</title>

arXiv:2509.22197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation, termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization (KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based (topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.

<title>Reversible GNS for Dissipative Fluids with Consistent Bidirectional Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems.

<title>A Law of Data Reconstruction for Random Features (and Beyond)</title>

arXiv:2509.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

arXiv:2509.22219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable, symmetry-aware representations.

<title>Fairness-Aware Reinforcement Learning (FAReL): A Framework for Transparent and Balanced Sequential Decision-Making</title>

arXiv:2509.22232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored. Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward. Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

<title>ASSESS: A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement Similarity</title>

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED (Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524 expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE, recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph structure is important.

<title>Erase or Hide? Suppressing Spurious Unlearning Neurons for Robust Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning" during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge. Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1) adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage. This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU), and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis applications.

arXiv:2509.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP, still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification, we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PatchMoE.

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps, diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore, extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic setup.

<title>A Multi-Level Framework for Multi-Objective Hypergraph Partitioning: Combining Minimum Spanning Tree and Proximal Gradient</title>

arXiv:2509.22294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse $k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration, swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to 35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis, Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models. Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts, the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization, encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs) deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information, HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs nearly by 20%.

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed, machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness, we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be explored for other applications.

<title>Adaptive Policy Backbone via Shared Network</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains, yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data, limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB), a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically fail.

<title>Progressive Weight Loading: Accelerating Initial Inference and Gradually Boosting Performance on Resource-Constrained Environments</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience. While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading (PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG, ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and performance are critical.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and associative memorization has recently been noted to underlie the operation of modern neural architectures such as Transformers. This work addresses a distributed setting where agents maintain a local AM to recall their own associations as well as selective information from others. Specifically, we introduce a distributed online gradient descent method that optimizes local AMs at different agents through communication over routing trees. Our theoretical analysis establishes sublinear regret guarantees, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed protocol consistently outperforms existing online optimization baselines.

<title>Spectral Collapse Drives Loss of Plasticity in Deep Continual Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.22335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity} in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$ penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

<title>SurvDiff: A Diffusion Model for Generating Synthetic Data in Survival Analysis</title>

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death. Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis. SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge; and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors. This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase the diversity of the generated text.

<title>Neural Feature Geometry Evolves as Discrete Ricci Flow</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000 feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting network depth.

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models (LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications. Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets: SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere. Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx, inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc 97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc 96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and flexibility of multi-modal phishing detection.

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making, necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree; unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI, however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

<title>SpinGPT: A Large-Language-Model Approach to Playing Poker Correctly</title>

arXiv:2509.22387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats. However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions; (2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100 versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information games like poker.

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12 datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning (RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However, such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound. Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration, effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic systems.

arXiv:2509.22416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks. Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

arXiv:2509.22418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

arXiv:2509.22426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant ($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and strengthened by our experiments.

Although more scalable alternatives such as the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points. Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed, especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point cloud data.

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency. However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training, particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled, universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization, highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis. PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$, recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation (SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$ (diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$ PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers, especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption. We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of 4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and 87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$ faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network surrogate.

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET, significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with comparable speed.

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable 3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich 3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular representations.

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step. To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction, indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA, suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues, practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting, proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning (DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however, not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios: weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance, which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative models for interactive systems.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications, necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space, while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e., bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit. It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries, such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper, we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where product utilities are non-additive.

<title>Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.22562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model $g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space $\mathcal{Z}$.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past. However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events. For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode, presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed, low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse, where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

<title>The Lie of the Average: How Class Incremental Learning Evaluation Deceives You?</title>

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking.

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation, and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

<title>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and {entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <= 1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove {two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K, roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1 gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

<title>IA2: Alignment with ICL Activations Improves Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast, In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning. Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner mechanics of model adaptation.

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources: (i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

<title>Learning Admissible Heuristics for A*: Theory and Practice</title>

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize. Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.

<title>Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title>

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly, slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity. Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%) by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance, highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping. This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES, Raman, FTIR).

Abstract: Seismic velocity inversion is a key task in geophysical exploration, enabling the reconstruction of subsurface structures from seismic wave data. It is critical for high-resolution seismic imaging and interpretation. Traditional physics-driven methods, such as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), are computationally demanding, sensitive to initialization, and limited by the bandwidth of seismic data. Recent advances in deep learning have led to data-driven approaches that treat velocity inversion as a dense prediction task. This research benchmarks three advanced encoder-decoder architectures -- U-Net, U-Net++, and DeepLabV3+ -- together with SeismoLabV3+, an optimized variant of DeepLabV3+ with a ResNeXt50 32x4d backbone and task-specific modifications -- for seismic velocity inversion using the ThinkOnward 2025 Speed \& Structure dataset, which consists of five-channel seismic shot gathers paired with high-resolution velocity maps. Experimental results show that SeismoLabV3+ achieves the best performance, with MAPE values of 0.03025 on the internal validation split and 0.031246 on the hidden test set as scored via the official ThinkOnward leaderboard. These findings demonstrate the suitability of deep segmentation networks for seismic velocity inversion and underscore the value of tailored architectural refinements in advancing geophysical AI models.

Abstract: We propose an information-topological framework in which cycle closure is the fundamental mechanism of memory and consciousness. Memory is not a static store but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically, polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations, generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness) across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at minimal energetic cost.

Abstract: We study symbolic surrogate modeling of frozen Transformer embeddings to obtain compact, auditable classifiers with calibrated probabilities. For five benchmarks (SST2G, 20NG, MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17), embeddings from ModernBERT, DINOv2, and SigLIP are partitioned on the training set into disjoint, information-preserving views via semantic-preserving feature partitioning (SPFP). A cooperative multi-population genetic program (MEGP) then learns additive, closed-form logit programs over these views. Across 30 runs per dataset we report F1, AUC, log-loss, Brier, expected calibration error (ECE), and symbolic complexity; a canonical model is chosen by a one-standard-error rule on validation F1 with a parsimony tie-break. Temperature scaling fitted on validation yields substantial ECE reductions on test. The resulting surrogates achieve strong discrimination (up to F1 around 0.99 on MNIST, CIFAR10, MSC17; around 0.95 on SST2G), while 20NG remains most challenging. We provide reliability diagrams, dimension usage and overlap statistics, contribution-based importances, and global effect profiles (PDP and ALE), demonstrating faithful, cross-modal explanations grounded in explicit programs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are exemplary deep models designed for graph data. Message passing mechanism enables GNNs to effectively capture graph topology and push the performance boundaries across various graph tasks. However, the trend of developing such complex machinery for graph representation learning has become unsustainable on large-scale graphs. The computational and time overhead make it imperative to develop more energy-efficient GNNs to cope with the explosive growth of real-world graphs. Spiking Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which integrate biologically plausible learning via unique spike-based neurons, have emerged as a promising energy-efficient alternative. Different layers communicate with sparse and binary spikes, which facilitates computation and storage of intermediate graph representations. Despite the proliferation of SGNNs proposed in recent years, there is no systematic benchmark to explore the basic design principles of these brain-inspired networks on the graph data. To bridge this gap, we present SGNNBench to quantify progress in the field of SGNNs. Specifically, SGNNBench conducts an in-depth investigation of SGNNs from multiple perspectives, including effectiveness, energy efficiency, and architectural design. We comprehensively evaluate 9 state-of-the-art SGNNs across 18 datasets. Regarding efficiency, we empirically compare these baselines w.r.t model size, memory usage, and theoretical energy consumption to reveal the often-overlooked energy bottlenecks of SGNNs. Besides, we elaborately investigate the design space of SGNNs to promote the development of a general SGNN paradigm.

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However, training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Abstract: Accurately assessing mental workload is crucial in cognitive neuroscience, human-computer interaction, and real-time monitoring, as cognitive load fluctuations affect performance and decision-making. While Electroencephalography (EEG) based machine learning (ML) models can be used to this end, their high computational cost hinders embedded real-time applications. Hardware implementations of spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative for low-power, fast, event-driven processing. This study compares hardware compatible SNN models with various traditional ML ones, using an open-source multimodal dataset. Our results show that multimodal integration improves accuracy, with SNN performance comparable to the ML one, demonstrating their potential for real-time implementations of cognitive load detection. These findings position event-based processing as a promising solution for low-latency, energy efficient workload monitoring in adaptive closed-loop embedded devices that dynamically regulate cognitive load.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity - particularly during periods of rapid intensification and rapid weakening - remains a challenge for operational meteorology, with high-stakes implications for disaster preparedness and infrastructure resilience. Recent advances in machine learning have yielded notable progress in TC prediction; however, most existing systems provide forecasts that degrade rapidly in extreme regimes and lack long-range consistency. Here we introduce TIFNet, a transformer-based forecasting model that generates non-iterative, 5-day intensity trajectories by integrating high-resolution global forecasts with a historical-evolution fusion mechanism. Trained on reanalysis data and fine-tuned with operational data, TIFNet consistently outperforms operational numerical models across all forecast horizons, delivering robust improvements across weak, strong, and super typhoon categories. In rapid intensity change regimes - long regarded as the most difficult to forecast - TIFNet reduces forecast error by 29-43% relative to current operational baselines. These results represent a substantial advance in artificial-intelligence-based TC intensity forecasting, especially under extreme conditions where traditional models consistently underperform.

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support autism assessment.

Abstract: The properties of complexes with transuranium elements have long been the object of research in various fields of chemistry. However, their experimental study is complicated by their rarity, high cost and special conditions necessary for working with such elements, and the complexity of quantum chemical calculations does not allow their use for large systems. To overcome these problems, we used modern machine learning methods to create a novel neural network architecture that allows to use available experimental data on a number of elements and thus significantly improve the quality of the resulting models. We also described the applicability domain of the presented model and identified the molecular fragments that most influence the stability of the complexes.

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models, which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset, referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent, lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well, highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information. Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups, including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover, the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as open-source software.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time. However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining. In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation, reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious correlations.

<title>Do Sparse Subnetworks Exhibit Cognitively Aligned Attention? Effects of Pruning on Saliency Map Fidelity, Sparsity, and Concept Coherence</title>

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making. However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5 km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections. Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Abstract: We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure.

<title>DyME: Dynamic Multi-Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Bi-Level Orthogonal LoRA Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns. Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science, and coding.

Abstract: We present GMLv2, a reference-based model designed for the prediction of subjective audio quality as measured by MUSHRA scores. GMLv2 introduces a Beta distribution-based loss to model the listener ratings and incorporates additional neural audio coding (NAC) subjective datasets to extend its generalization and applicability. Extensive evaluations on diverse testset demonstrate that proposed GMLv2 consistently outperforms widely used metrics, such as PEAQ and ViSQOL, both in terms of correlation with subjective scores and in reliably predicting these scores across diverse content types and codec configurations. Consequently, GMLv2 offers a scalable and automated framework for perceptual audio quality evaluation, poised to accelerate research and development in modern audio coding technologies.

<title>Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

Abstract: Bluetooth-based mesh networks offer a promising infrastructure for offline communication in emergency and resource constrained scenarios. However, traditional routing strategies such as Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) often degrade under congestion and dynamic topological changes. This study proposes a hybrid intelligent routing framework that augments AODV with supervised machine learning to improve next-hop selection under varied network constraints. The framework integrates four predictive models: a delivery success classifier, a TTL regressor, a delay regressor, and a forwarder suitability classifier, into a unified scoring mechanism that dynamically ranks neighbors during multi-hop message transmission. A simulation environment with stationary node deployments was developed, incorporating buffer constraints and device heterogeneity to evaluate three strategies: baseline AODV, a partial hybrid ML model (ABC), and the full hybrid ML model (ABCD). Across ten scenarios, the Hybrid ABCD model achieves approximately 99.97 percent packet delivery under these controlled conditions, significantly outperforming both the baseline and intermediate approaches. The results demonstrate that lightweight, explainable machine learning models can enhance routing reliability and adaptability in Bluetooth mesh networks, particularly in infrastructure-less environments where delivery success is prioritized over latency constraints.

Abstract: With the increased interest in artificial intelligence, Machine Learning as a Service provides the infrastructure in the Cloud for easy training, testing, and deploying models. However, these systems have a major privacy issue: uploading sensitive data to the Cloud, especially during training. Therefore, achieving secure Neural Network training has been on many researchers' minds lately. More and more solutions for this problem are built around a main pillar: Functional Encryption (FE). Although these approaches are very interesting and offer a new perspective on ML training over encrypted data, some vulnerabilities do not seem to be taken into consideration. In our paper, we present an attack on neural networks that uses FE for secure training over encrypted data. Our approach uses linear programming to reconstruct the original input, unveiling the previous security promises. To address the attack, we propose two solutions for secure training and inference that involve the client during the computation phase. One approach ensures security without relying on encryption, while the other uses function-hiding inner-product techniques.

Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions $\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$. Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under $\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$ is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be "sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For $\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure $\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.

In order to answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%. After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph (KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible, extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap. A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing. Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment, while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs, achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) associates to each weight in the underlying linear model a hyperparameter by assuming that each weight is Gaussian distributed with zero mean and precision (inverse variance) equal to its associated hyperparameter. The method estimates the hyperparameters by marginalizing out the weights and performing (marginalized) maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. SBL returns many hyperparameter estimates to diverge to infinity, effectively setting the estimates of the corresponding weights to zero (i.e., pruning the corresponding weights from the model) and thereby yielding a sparse estimate of the weight vector.
  In this letter, we analyze the marginal likelihood as function of a single hyperparameter while keeping the others fixed, when the Gaussian assumptions on the noise samples and the weight distribution that underlies the derivation of SBL are weakened. We derive sufficient conditions that lead, on the one hand, to finite hyperparameter estimates and, on the other, to infinite ones. Finally, we show that in the Gaussian case, the two conditions are complementary and coincide with the pruning condition of fast SBL (F-SBL), thereby providing additional insights into this algorithm.

<title>IndiSeek learns information-guided disentangled representations</title>

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations is a fundamental task in multi-modal learning. In modern applications such as single-cell multi-omics, both shared and modality-specific features are critical for characterizing cell states and supporting downstream analyses. Ideally, modality-specific features should be independent of shared ones while also capturing all complementary information within each modality. This tradeoff is naturally expressed through information-theoretic criteria, but mutual-information-based objectives are difficult to estimate reliably, and their variational surrogates often underperform in practice. In this paper, we introduce IndiSeek, a novel disentangled representation learning approach that addresses this challenge by combining an independence-enforcing objective with a computationally efficient reconstruction loss that bounds conditional mutual information. This formulation explicitly balances independence and completeness, enabling principled extraction of modality-specific features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IndiSeek on synthetic simulations, a CITE-seq dataset and multiple real-world multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e., predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity. We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM, while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for precision oncology with MultiFIX.

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet, conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive, contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset. Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness. Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models, attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) presents significant challenges and opportunities for optimizing multiple objectives in Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce a MORL taxonomy and examine the advantages and limitations of various MORL methods when applied to LLM optimization, identifying the need for efficient and flexible approaches that accommodate personalization functionality and inherent complexities in LLMs and RL. We propose a vision for a MORL benchmarking framework that addresses the effects of different methods on diverse objective relationships. As future research directions, we focus on meta-policy MORL development that can improve efficiency and flexibility through its bi-level learning paradigm, highlighting key research questions and potential solutions for improving LLM performance.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of some popular adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods in the small learning rate regime. Using the stochastic modified equations framework introduced by Li et al., we derive effective continuous stochastic dynamics for these methods. Our key contribution is that sampling-induced noise in SGD manifests in the limit as independent Brownian motions driving the parameter and gradient second momentum evolutions. Furthermore, extending the approach of Malladi et al., we investigate scaling rules between the learning rate and key hyperparameters in adaptive methods, characterising all non-trivial limiting dynamics.

<title>OjaKV: Context-Aware Online Low-Rank KV Cache Compression with Oja's Rule</title>

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of 4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular, OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing, sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism, and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.

Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%, and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.

<title>MobiLLM: An Agentic AI Framework for Closed-Loop Threat Mitigation in 6G Open RANs</title>

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks is being accelerated by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) paradigm -- an open, interoperable architecture that enables intelligent, modular applications across public telecom and private enterprise domains. While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.
  To address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become powerful tools to extend molecular simulations beyond the limits of quantum methods, offering near-quantum accuracy at much lower computational cost. Yet, developing reliable MLIPs remains difficult because it requires generating high-quality datasets, preprocessing atomic structures, and carefully training and validating models. In this work, we introduce an Automated Machine Learning Pipeline (AMLP) that unifies the entire workflow from dataset creation to model validation. AMLP employs large-language-model agents to assist with electronic-structure code selection, input preparation, and output conversion, while its analysis suite (AMLP-Analysis), based on ASE supports a range of molecular simulations. The pipeline is built on the MACE architecture and validated on acridine polymorphs, where, with a straightforward fine-tuning of a foundation model, mean absolute errors of ~1.7 meV/atom in energies and ~7.0 meV/{\AA} in forces are achieved. The fitted MLIP reproduces DFT geometries with sub-{\AA} accuracy and demonstrates stability during molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.

Abstract: We propose a conversion scheme that turns regret minimizing algorithms into fixed point iterations, with convergence guarantees following from regret bounds. The resulting iterations can be seen as a grand extension of the classical Krasnoselskii--Mann iterations, as the latter are recovered by converting the Online Gradient Descent algorithm. This approach yields new simple iterations for finding fixed points of non-self operators. We also focus on converting algorithms from the AdaGrad family of regret minimizers, and thus obtain fixed point iterations with adaptive guarantees of a new kind. Numerical experiments on various problems demonstrate faster convergence of AdaGrad-based fixed point iterations over Krasnoselskii--Mann iterations.

Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.

Abstract: Stably placing an object in a multi-object scene is a fundamental challenge in robotic manipulation, as placements must be penetration-free, establish precise surface contact, and result in a force equilibrium. To assess stability, existing methods rely on running a simulation engine or resort to heuristic, appearance-based assessments. In contrast, our approach integrates stability directly into the sampling process of a diffusion model. To this end, we query an offline sampling-based planner to gather multi-modal placement labels and train a diffusion model to generate stable placements. The diffusion model is conditioned on scene and object point clouds, and serves as a geometry-aware prior. We leverage the compositional nature of score-based generative models to combine this learned prior with a stability-aware loss, thereby increasing the likelihood of sampling from regions of high stability. Importantly, this strategy requires no additional re-training or fine-tuning, and can be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. We evaluate our method on four benchmark scenes where stability can be accurately computed. Our physics-guided models achieve placements that are 56% more robust to forceful perturbations while reducing runtime by 47% compared to a state-of-the-art geometric method.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<title>HuLA: Prosody-Aware Anti-Spoofing with Multi-Task Learning for Expressive and Emotional Synthetic Speech</title>

Abstract: Current anti-spoofing systems remain vulnerable to expressive and emotional synthetic speech, since they rarely leverage prosody as a discriminative cue. Prosody is central to human expressiveness and emotion, and humans instinctively use prosodic cues such as F0 patterns and voiced/unvoiced structure to distinguish natural from synthetic speech. In this paper, we propose HuLA, a two-stage prosody-aware multi-task learning framework for spoof detection. In Stage 1, a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone is trained on real speech with auxiliary tasks of F0 prediction and voiced/unvoiced classification, enhancing its ability to capture natural prosodic variation similar to human perceptual learning. In Stage 2, the model is jointly optimized for spoof detection and prosody tasks on both real and synthetic data, leveraging prosodic awareness to detect mismatches between natural and expressive synthetic speech. Experiments show that HuLA consistently outperforms strong baselines on challenging out-of-domain dataset, including expressive, emotional, and cross-lingual attacks. These results demonstrate that explicit prosodic supervision, combined with SSL embeddings, substantially improves robustness against advanced synthetic speech attacks.

Abstract: Real-world applications often face scarce labeled data due to the high cost and time requirements of gold-standard experiments, whereas unlabeled data are typically abundant. With the growing adoption of machine learning techniques, it has become increasingly feasible to generate multiple predicted labels using a variety of models and algorithms, including deep learning, large language models, and generative AI. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that safely and adaptively aggregates multiple black-box predictions with unknown quality while preserving valid statistical inference. Our method provides two key guarantees: (i) it never performs worse than using the labeled data alone, regardless of the quality of the predictions; and (ii) if any one of the predictions (without knowing which one) perfectly fits the ground truth, the algorithm adaptively exploits this to achieve either a faster convergence rate or the semiparametric efficiency bound. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on both synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: As data collection and simulation capabilities advance, multi-modal learning, the task of learning from multiple modalities and sources of data, is becoming an increasingly important area of research. Surrogate models that learn from data of multiple auxiliary modalities to support the modeling of a highly expensive quantity of interest have the potential to aid outer loop applications such as optimization, inverse problems, or sensitivity analyses when multi-modal data are available. We develop two multi-modal Bayesian neural network surrogate models and leverage conditionally conjugate distributions in the last layer to estimate model parameters using stochastic variational inference (SVI). We provide a method to perform this conjugate SVI estimation in the presence of partially missing observations. We demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to uni-modal surrogate models for both scalar and time series data.

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts. We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens. Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout. This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI agents.

Abstract: Automatic drum transcription (ADT) is traditionally formulated as a discriminative task to predict drum events from audio spectrograms. In this work, we redefine ADT as a conditional generative task and introduce Noise-to-Notes (N2N), a framework leveraging diffusion modeling to transform audio-conditioned Gaussian noise into drum events with associated velocities. This generative diffusion approach offers distinct advantages, including a flexible speed-accuracy trade-off and strong inpainting capabilities. However, the generation of binary onset and continuous velocity values presents a challenge for diffusion models, and to overcome this, we introduce an Annealed Pseudo-Huber loss to facilitate effective joint optimization. Finally, to augment low-level spectrogram features, we propose incorporating features extracted from music foundation models (MFMs), which capture high-level semantic information and enhance robustness to out-of-domain drum audio. Experimental results demonstrate that including MFM features significantly improves robustness and N2N establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across multiple ADT benchmarks.

<title>Self-Speculative Biased Decoding for Faster Live Translation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation), where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications. Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only mask-k technique.

<title>Retrieval-of-Thought: Efficient Reasoning via Reusing Thoughts</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces, but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable ``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and, therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage, latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction through retrieval.

Abstract: Efficient traffic signal control (TSC) is crucial for reducing congestion, travel delays, pollution, and for ensuring road safety. Traditional approaches, such as fixed signal control and actuated control, often struggle to handle dynamic traffic patterns. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive TSC framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL), using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to minimize total queue lengths across all signal phases. The challenge of efficiently representing highly stochastic traffic conditions for an RL controller is addressed through multiple state representations, including an expanded state space, an autoencoder representation, and a K-Planes-inspired representation. The proposed algorithm has been implemented using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator and demonstrates superior performance over both traditional methods and other conventional RL-based approaches in reducing queue lengths. The best performing configuration achieves an approximately 29% reduction in average queue lengths compared to the traditional Webster method. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of alternative reward formulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed queue-based approach, showcasing the potential for scalable and adaptive urban traffic management.

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks. Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

<title>Lifelong Learning with Behavior Consolidation for Vehicle Routing</title>

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed. LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way. To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue, maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings, and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2) collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining 5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete instructions.

<title>SBFA: Single Sneaky Bit Flip Attack to Break Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing security concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs' catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats. Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a severe security concern of SOTA LLM models.

<title>Causal-EPIG: A Prediction-Oriented Active Learning Framework for CATE Estimation</title>

Abstract: Estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is often constrained by the high cost of obtaining outcome measurements, making active learning essential. However, conventional active learning strategies suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch. They are designed to reduce uncertainty in model parameters or in observable factual outcomes, failing to directly target the unobservable causal quantities that are the true objects of interest. To address this misalignment, we introduce the principle of causal objective alignment, which posits that acquisition functions should target unobservable causal quantities, such as the potential outcomes and the CATE, rather than indirect proxies. We operationalize this principle through the Causal-EPIG framework, which adapts the information-theoretic criterion of Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG) to explicitly quantify the value of a query in terms of reducing uncertainty about unobservable causal quantities. From this unified framework, we derive two distinct strategies that embody a fundamental trade-off: a comprehensive approach that robustly models the full causal mechanisms via the joint potential outcomes, and a focused approach that directly targets the CATE estimand for maximum sample efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our strategies consistently outperform standard baselines, and crucially, reveal that the optimal strategy is context-dependent, contingent on the base estimator and data complexity. Our framework thus provides a principled guide for sample-efficient CATE estimation in practice.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61 points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts in RLVR.

<title>Elastic MoE: Unlocking the Inference-Time Scalability of Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts $k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However, contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings. Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher level.

Abstract: Discrete flow models offer a powerful framework for learning distributions over discrete state spaces and have demonstrated superior performance compared to the discrete diffusion model. However, their convergence properties and error analysis remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a unified framework grounded in stochastic calculus theory to systematically investigate the theoretical properties of discrete flow. Specifically, we derive the KL divergence of two path measures regarding two continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) with different transition rates by developing a novel Girsanov-type theorem, and provide a comprehensive analysis that encompasses the error arising from transition rate estimation and early stopping, where the first type of error has rarely been analyzed by existing works. Unlike discrete diffusion models, discrete flow incurs no truncation error caused by truncating the time horizon in the noising process. Building on generator matching and uniformization, we establish non-asymptotic error bounds for distribution estimation. Our results provide the first error analysis for discrete flow models.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with 1-bit communication constraints. We propose a mean estimator that is based on (randomized and sequentially-chosen) interval queries, whose 1-bit outcome indicates whether the given sample lies in the specified interval. Our estimator is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC for all distributions with bounded mean ($-\lambda \le \mathbb{E}(X) \le \lambda $) and variance ($\mathrm{Var}(X) \le \sigma^2$) for some known parameters $\lambda$ and $\sigma$. We derive a sample complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\big( \frac{\sigma^2}{\epsilon^2}\log\frac{1}{\delta} + \log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}\big)$, which matches the minimax lower bound for the unquantized setting up to logarithmic factors and the additional $\log\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$ term that we show to be unavoidable. We also establish an adaptivity gap for interval-query based estimators: the best non-adaptive mean estimator is considerably worse than our adaptive mean estimator for large $\frac{\lambda}{\sigma}$. Finally, we give tightened sample complexity bounds for distributions with stronger tail decay, and present additional variants that (i) handle an unknown sampling budget (ii) adapt to the unknown true variance given (possibly loose) upper and lower bounds on the variance, and (iii) use only two stages of adaptivity at the expense of more complicated (non-interval) queries.

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform decision-making.

Abstract: Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets.
  LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to 91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP.
  The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory) and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and 15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being 7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.

Abstract: Learning-based planners are sensitive to the long-tailed distribution of driving data. Common maneuvers dominate datasets, while dangerous or rare scenarios are sparse. This imbalance can bias models toward the frequent cases and degrade performance on critical scenarios. To tackle this problem, we compare balancing strategies for sampling training data and find reweighting by trajectory pattern an effective approach. We then present FlowDrive, a flow-matching trajectory planner that learns a conditional rectified flow to map noise directly to trajectory distributions with few flow-matching steps. We further introduce moderated, in-the-loop guidance that injects small perturbation between flow steps to systematically increase trajectory diversity while remaining scene-consistent. On nuPlan and the interaction-focused interPlan benchmarks, FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based planners and approaches methods with rule-based refinements. After adding moderated guidance and light post-processing (FlowDrive*), it achieves overall state-of-the-art performance across nearly all benchmark splits.

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end, we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V* benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a 3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at: https://github.com/nota-github/ERGO.

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

Many applications record events as counts on a regular grid, yet discrete-time Hawkes models remain comparatively underused and are often constrained by fixed-form baselines and excitation kernels. In particular, there is a lack of flexible, nonparametric treatments of both the baseline and the excitation in discrete time. To this end, we propose the Gaussian Process Discrete Hawkes Process (GP-DHP), a nonparametric framework that places Gaussian process priors on both the baseline and the excitation and performs inference through a collapsed latent representation. This yields smooth, data-adaptive structure without prespecifying trends, periodicities, or decay shapes, and enables maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with near-linear-time \(O(T\log T)\) complexity. A closed-form projection recovers interpretable baseline and excitation functions from the optimized latent trajectory. In simulations, GP-DHP recovers diverse excitation shapes and evolving baselines. In case studies on U.S. terrorism incidents and weekly Cryptosporidiosis counts, it improves test predictive log-likelihood over standard parametric discrete Hawkes baselines while capturing bursts, delays, and seasonal background variation. The results indicate that flexible discrete-time self-excitation can be achieved without sacrificing scalability or interpretability.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning.

Abstract: We present a rigorous asymptotic analysis of Echo State Networks (ESNs) in a teacher student setting with a linear teacher with oracle weights. Leveraging random matrix theory, we derive closed form expressions for the asymptotic bias, variance, and mean-squared error (MSE) as functions of the input statistics, the oracle vector, and the ridge regularization parameter. The analysis reveals two key departures from classical ridge regression: (i) ESNs do not exhibit double descent, and (ii) ESNs attain lower MSE when both the number of training samples and the teacher memory length are limited. We further provide an explicit formula for the optimal regularization in the identity input covariance case, and propose an efficient numerical scheme to compute the optimum in the general case. Together, these results offer interpretable theory and practical guidelines for tuning ESNs, helping reconcile recent empirical observations with provable performance guarantees

Abstract: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is essential for treatment and diagnostics; In case CT are missing or otherwise difficult to obtain, methods for generating synthetic CT (sCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are sought after. Therefore, it is valuable to establish a reference for what strategies are most effective for MRI-to-CT translation. In this paper, we compare the performance of two frequently used architectures for MRI-to-CT translation: a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (cDDPM). We chose well-established implementations to represent each architecture: Pix2Pix for cGAN, and Palette for cDDPM. We separate the classical 3D translation problem into a sequence of 2D translations on the transverse plane, to investigate the viability of a strategy that reduces the computational cost. We also investigate the impact of conditioning the generative process on a single MRI image/slice and on multiple MRI slices. The performance is assessed using a thorough evaluation protocol, including a novel slice-wise metric Similarity Of Slices (SIMOS), which measures the continuity between transverse slices when compiling the sCTs into 3D format. Our comparative analysis revealed that MRI-to-CT generative models benefit from multi-channel conditional input and using cDDPM as an architecture.

<title>Direct Bias-Correction Term Estimation for Propensity Scores and Average Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

Abstract: This study considers the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE). For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct bias-correction term estimation. Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the observations, where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates, $D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term $h_0(X_i, D_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$ plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly minimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$ is essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve estimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ maximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these approaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We present a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation approach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Regularized linear regression is central to machine learning, yet its high-dimensional behavior with informative priors remains poorly understood. We provide the first exact asymptotic characterization of training and test risks for maximum a posteriori (MAP) regression with Gaussian priors centered at a domain-informed initialization. Our framework unifies ridge regression, least squares, and prior-informed estimators, and -- using random matrix theory -- yields closed-form risk formulas that expose the bias-variance-prior tradeoff, explain double descent, and quantify prior mismatch. We also identify a closed-form minimizer of test risk, enabling a simple estimator of the optimal regularization parameter. Simulations confirm the theory with high accuracy. By connecting Bayesian priors, classical regularization, and modern asymptotics, our results provide both conceptual clarity and practical guidance for learning with structured prior knowledge.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) poses a significant and challenging problem critical for applications in robotics and logistics, particularly due to its combinatorial complexity and the partial observability inherent in realistic environments. Decentralized reinforcement learning methods commonly encounter two substantial difficulties: first, they often yield self-centered behaviors among agents, resulting in frequent collisions, and second, their reliance on complex communication modules leads to prolonged training times, sometimes spanning weeks. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient decentralized planning framework based on the Decision Transformer (DT), uniquely leveraging offline reinforcement learning to substantially reduce training durations from weeks to mere hours. Crucially, our approach effectively handles long-horizon credit assignment and significantly improves performance in scenarios with sparse and delayed rewards. Furthermore, to overcome adaptability limitations inherent in standard RL methods under dynamic environmental changes, we integrate a large language model (GPT-4o) to dynamically guide agent policies. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamically changing environments demonstrate that our DT-based approach, augmented briefly by GPT-4o, significantly enhances adaptability and performance.

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces. We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+ layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains (AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing applications.

Abstract: In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models is often based on the accuracy of derived downstream metrics such as organ size, rather than by the pixel-level accuracy of the segmentation masks themselves. Thus, uncertainty quantification for such metrics is crucial for decision-making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular framework to derive such principled uncertainty guarantees, but applying CP naively to the final scalar metric is inefficient because it treats the complex, non-linear segmentation-to-metric pipeline as a black box. We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that generates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by leveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks. COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally sensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal coverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than traditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures. Furthermore, we show that leveraging learned internal features to estimate importance weights allows COMPASS to also recover target coverage under covariate shifts. COMPASS paves the way for practical, metric-based uncertainty quantification for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better reflect clinical data.

<title>Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models</title>

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation, their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps (instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with higher fidelity.

Abstract: Model collapse occurs when generative models degrade after repeatedly training on their own synthetic outputs. We study this effect in overparameterized linear regression in a setting where each iteration mixes fresh real labels with synthetic labels drawn from the model fitted in the previous iteration. We derive precise generalization error formulae for minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative scheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight that minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse. For instance, in the case of min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that the optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden ratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this property was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low dimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes -- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating how spectral geometry governs optimal weighting. In both cases, as well as for isotropic features, we uncover that the optimal mixing ratio should be at least one-half, reflecting the necessity of favoring real-data over synthetic. We validate our theoretical results with extensive simulations.

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g., knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components, transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the number of components is large.

Abstract: Classification using variational quantum circuits is a promising frontier in quantum machine learning. Quantum supervised learning (QSL) applied to classical data using variational quantum circuits involves embedding the data into a quantum Hilbert space and optimizing the circuit parameters to train the measurement process. In this context, the efficacy of QSL is inherently influenced by the selection of quantum embedding. In this study, we introduce a classical-quantum hybrid approach for optimizing quantum embedding beyond the limitations of the standard circuit model of quantum computation (i.e., completely positive and trace-preserving maps) for general multi-channel data. We benchmark the performance of various models in our framework using the CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets and provide theoretical analyses that guide model design and optimization.

Abstract: Most uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches provide a single scalar value as a measure of model reliability. However, different uncertainty measures could provide complementary information on the prediction confidence. Even measures targeting the same type of uncertainty (e.g., ensemble-based and density-based measures of epistemic uncertainty) may capture different failure modes.
  We take a multidimensional view on UQ by stacking complementary UQ measures into a vector. Such vectors are assigned with Monge-Kantorovich ranks produced by an optimal-transport-based ordering method. The prediction is then deemed more uncertain than the other if it has a higher rank.
  The resulting VecUQ-OT algorithm uses entropy-regularized optimal transport. The transport map is learned on vectors of scores from in-distribution data and, by design, applies to unseen inputs, including out-of-distribution cases, without retraining.
  Our framework supports flexible non-additive uncertainty fusion (including aleatoric and epistemic components). It yields a robust ordering for downstream tasks such as selective prediction, misclassification detection, out-of-distribution detection, and selective generation. Across synthetic, image, and text data, VecUQ-OT shows high efficiency even when individual measures fail. The code for the method is available at: https://github.com/stat-ml/multidimensional_uncertainty.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications, which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic (FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The evaluation of new microprocessor designs is constrained by slow, cycle-accurate simulators that rely on unrepresentative benchmark traces. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for high-fidelity, ``in-the-wild'' simulation on production hardware. Our core contribution is a DL model trained on microarchitecture-independent features to predict cycle-level performance for hypothetical processor designs. This unique approach allows the model to be deployed on existing silicon to evaluate future hardware. We propose a complete system featuring a lightweight hardware trace collector and a principled sampling strategy to minimize user impact. This system achieves a simulation speed of 5 MIPS on a commodity GPU, imposing a mere 0.1% performance overhead. Furthermore, our co-designed Neutrino on-chip accelerator improves performance by 85x over the GPU. We demonstrate that this framework enables accurate performance analysis and large-scale hardware A/B testing on a massive scale using real-world applications.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills. A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states. Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.

<title>Universal Inverse Distillation for Matching Models with Real-Data Supervision (No GANs)</title>

Abstract: While achieving exceptional generative quality, modern diffusion, flow, and other matching models suffer from slow inference, as they require many steps of iterative generation. Recent distillation methods address this by training efficient one-step generators under the guidance of a pre-trained teacher model. However, these methods are often constrained to only one specific framework, e.g., only to diffusion or only to flow models. Furthermore, these methods are naturally data-free, and to benefit from the usage of real data, it is required to use an additional complex adversarial training with an extra discriminator model. In this paper, we present RealUID, a universal distillation framework for all matching models that seamlessly incorporates real data into the distillation procedure without GANs. Our RealUID approach offers a simple theoretical foundation that covers previous distillation methods for Flow Matching and Diffusion models, and is also extended to their modifications, such as Bridge Matching and Stochastic Interpolants.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, but their opacity limits trust and adoption in sensitive domains such as medicine, economics, and public policy. Building on well-established and high-performing causal neural architectures, we propose causalKANs, a framework that transforms neural estimators of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) into Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs). By incorporating pruning and symbolic simplification, causalKANs yields interpretable closed-form formulas while preserving predictive accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that causalKANs perform on par with neural baselines in CATE error metrics, and that even simple KAN variants achieve competitive performance, offering a favorable accuracy--interpretability trade-off. By combining reliability with analytic accessibility, causalKANs provide auditable estimators supported by closed-form expressions and interpretable plots, enabling trustworthy individualized decision-making in high-stakes settings. We release the code for reproducibility at https://github.com/aalmodovares/causalkans .

<title>Evaluating the Limits of Large Language Models in Multilingual Legal Reasoning</title>

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation. We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification, summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below 50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24 percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs, challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal applications.

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks, and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models' application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments, including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers, and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

<title>REMA: A Unified Reasoning Manifold Framework for Interpreting Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models.

<title>Smoothing-Based Conformal Prediction for Balancing Efficiency and Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free framework for constructing statistically rigorous prediction sets. While popular variants such as CD-split improve CP's efficiency, they often yield prediction sets composed of multiple disconnected subintervals, which are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose SCD-split, which incorporates smoothing operations into the CP framework. Such smoothing operations potentially help merge the subintervals, thus leading to interpretable prediction sets. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SCD-split balances the interval length and the number of disconnected subintervals. Theoretically, under specific conditions, SCD-split provably reduces the number of disconnected subintervals while maintaining comparable coverage guarantees and interval length compared with CD-split.

Abstract: In observational settings where treatment and outcome share unmeasured confounders but an observed mediator remains unconfounded, the front-door (FD) adjustment identifies causal effects through the mediator. We study the heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) under FD identification and introduce two debiased learners: FD-DR-Learner and FD-R-Learner. Both attain fast, quasi-oracle rates (i.e., performance comparable to an oracle that knows the nuisances) even when nuisance functions converge as slowly as n^-1/4. We provide error analyses establishing debiasedness and demonstrate robust empirical performance in synthetic studies and a real-world case study of primary seat-belt laws using Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset. Together, these results indicate that the proposed learners deliver reliable and sample-efficient HTE estimates in FD scenarios. The implementation is available at https://github.com/yonghanjung/FD-CATE.

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for analyzing data modeled as parameterized families of networks. Building on a Gromov-Wasserstein variant of optimal transport, we define a family of parameterized Gromov-Wasserstein distances for comparing such parametric data, including time-varying metric spaces induced by collective motion, temporally evolving weighted social networks, and random graph models. We establish foundational properties of these distances, showing that they subsume several existing metrics in the literature, and derive theoretical approximation guarantees. In particular, we develop computationally tractable lower bounds and relate them to graph statistics commonly used in random graph theory. Furthermore, we prove that our distances can be consistently approximated in random graph and random metric space settings via empirical estimates from generative models. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework through a series of numerical experiments.

Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has garnered increasing interests from the causal inference and artificial intelligence community, due to its capability of disentangling potentially complex data-generating mechanism into causally interpretable latent features, by leveraging the heterogeneity of modern datasets. In this paper, we further contribute to the CRL literature, by focusing on the stylized linear structural causal model over the latent features and assuming a linear mixing function that maps latent features to the observed data or measurements. Existing linear CRL methods often rely on stringent assumptions, such as accessibility to single-node interventional data or restrictive distributional constraints on latent features and exogenous measurement noise. However, these prerequisites can be challenging to satisfy in certain scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel linear CRL algorithm that, unlike most existing linear CRL methods, operates under weaker assumptions about environment heterogeneity and data-generating distributions while still recovering latent causal features up to an equivalence class. We further validate our new algorithm via synthetic experiments and an interpretability analysis of large language models (LLMs), demonstrating both its superiority over competing methods in finite samples and its potential in integrating causality into AI.

<title>Nearly Tight Regret Bounds for Profit Maximization in Bilateral Trade</title>

Abstract: Bilateral trade models the task of intermediating between two strategic agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade a good for which they hold private valuations. We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, in a regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyer arrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentive-compatible and individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit.
  We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyer valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknown distribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regret in the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by an adversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the best incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates us from previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where the benchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight.
  A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for all mechanisms' profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a careful chaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanism at (essentially) optimal rate. We further showcase the broader applicability of our techniques by providing nearly optimal results for the joint ads problem.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we present two effective policy learning algorithms for multi-agent online coordination(MA-OC) problem. The first one, \texttt{MA-SPL}, not only can achieve the optimal $(1-\frac{c}{e})$-approximation guarantee for the MA-OC problem with submodular objectives but also can handle the unexplored $\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular and $(\gamma,\beta)$-weakly submodular scenarios, where $c$ is the curvature of the investigated submodular functions, $\alpha$ denotes the diminishing-return(DR) ratio and the tuple $(\gamma,\beta)$ represents the submodularity ratios. Subsequently, in order to reduce the reliance on the unknown parameters $\alpha,\gamma,\beta$ inherent in the \texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm, we further introduce the second online algorithm named \texttt{MA-MPL}. This \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithm is entirely \emph{parameter-free} and simultaneously can maintain the same approximation ratio as the first \texttt{MA-SPL} algorithm. The core of our \texttt{MA-SPL} and \texttt{MA-MPL} algorithms is a novel continuous-relaxation technique termed as \emph{policy-based continuous extension}. Compared with the well-established \emph{multi-linear extension}, a notable advantage of this new \emph{policy-based continuous extension} is its ability to provide a lossless rounding scheme for any set function, thereby enabling us to tackle the challenging weakly submodular objectives. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

These results demonstrate that the subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for modeling natural language structure.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice.

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts, because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters. Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling polynomially in all model parameters.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction. Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models.

<title>Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards</title>

arXiv:2509.22638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

Abstract: This paper develops a policy learning method for tuning a pre-trained policy to adapt to additional tasks without altering the original task. A method named Adaptive Policy Gradient (APG) is proposed in this paper, which combines Bellman's principle of optimality with the policy gradient approach to improve the convergence rate. This paper provides theoretical analysis which guarantees the convergence rate and sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$, respectively, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $\epsilon$ denotes the accuracy of the resulting stationary policy. Furthermore, several challenging numerical simulations, including cartpole, lunar lander, and robot arm, are provided to show that APG obtains similar performance compared to existing deterministic policy gradient methods while utilizing much less data and converging at a faster rate.

Abstract: This work introduces an efficient novel approach for epistemic uncertainty estimation for ensemble models for regression tasks using pairwise-distance estimators (PaiDEs). Utilizing the pairwise-distance between model components, these estimators establish bounds on entropy. We leverage this capability to enhance the performance of Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD). Notably, unlike sample-based Monte Carlo estimators, PaiDEs exhibit a remarkable capability to estimate epistemic uncertainty at speeds up to 100 times faster while covering a significantly larger number of inputs at once and demonstrating superior performance in higher dimensions. To validate our approach, we conducted a varied series of regression experiments on commonly used benchmarks: 1D sinusoidal data, $\textit{Pendulum}$, $\textit{Hopper}$, $\textit{Ant}$ and $\textit{Humanoid}$. For each experimental setting, an active learning framework was applied to demonstrate the advantages of PaiDEs for epistemic uncertainty estimation. We compare our approach to existing active learning methods and find that our approach outperforms on high-dimensional regression tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning approach named Value Decomposition Framework with Disentangled World Model to address the challenge of achieving a common goal of multiple agents interacting in the same environment with reduced sample complexity. Due to scalability and non-stationarity problems posed by multi-agent systems, model-free methods rely on a considerable number of samples for training. In contrast, we use a modularized world model, composed of action-conditioned, action-free, and static branches, to unravel the complicated environment dynamics. Our model produces imagined outcomes based on past experience, without sampling directly from the real environment. We employ variational auto-encoders and variational graph auto-encoders to learn the latent representations for the world model, which is merged with a value-based framework to predict the joint action-value function and optimize the overall training objective. Experimental results on StarCraft II micro-management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges demonstrate that our method achieves high sample efficiency and exhibits superior performance compared to other baselines across a wide range of multi-agent learning tasks.

<title>Fast Partition-Based Cross-Validation With Centering and Scaling for $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$</title>

Abstract: We present algorithms that substantially accelerate partition-based cross-validation for machine learning models that require matrix products $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Our algorithms have applications in model selection for, for example, principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR), ridge regression (RR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and partial least squares (PLS). Our algorithms support all combinations of column-wise centering and scaling of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$, and we demonstrate in our accompanying implementation that this adds only a manageable, practical constant over efficient variants without preprocessing. We prove the correctness of our algorithms under a fold-based partitioning scheme and show that the running time is independent of the number of folds; that is, they have the same time complexity as that of computing $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ and space complexity equivalent to storing $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{Y}$, $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$, and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Importantly, unlike alternatives found in the literature, we avoid data leakage due to preprocessing. We achieve these results by eliminating redundant computations in the overlap between training partitions. Concretely, we show how to manipulate $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ using only samples from the validation partition to obtain the preprocessed training partition-wise $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. To our knowledge, we are the first to derive correct and efficient cross-validation algorithms for any of the $16$ combinations of column-wise centering and scaling, for which we also prove only $12$ give distinct matrix products.

Abstract: Modern deep learning reconstruction algorithms generate impressively realistic scans from sparse inputs, but can often produce significant inaccuracies. This makes it difficult to provide statistically guaranteed claims about the true state of a subject from scans reconstructed by these algorithms. In this study, we propose a framework for computing provably valid prediction bounds on claims derived from probabilistic black-box image reconstruction algorithms. The key insights behind our framework are to represent reconstructed scans with a derived clinical metric of interest, and to calibrate bounds on the ground truth metric with conformal prediction (CP) using a prior calibration dataset. These bounds convey interpretable feedback about the subject's state, and can also be used to retrieve nearest-neighbor reconstructed scans for visual inspection. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on sparse-view computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification and radiotherapy planning tasks. Results show that our framework produces bounds with better semantical interpretation than conventional pixel-based bounding approaches. Furthermore, we can flag dangerous outlier reconstructions that look plausible but have statistically unlikely metric values.

Abstract: We propose a new notion of uniqueness for the adversarial Bayes classifier in the setting of binary classification. Analyzing this concept produces a simple procedure for computing all adversarial Bayes classifiers for a well-motivated family of one dimensional data distributions. This characterization is then leveraged to show that as the perturbation radius increases, certain notions of regularity for the adversarial Bayes classifiers improve. Furthermore, these results provide tools for understanding relationships between the Bayes and adversarial Bayes classifiers in one dimension.

Abstract: The sustainable utilization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial to the global energy transition and carbon neutrality, yet data scarcity and heterogeneity remain major barriers across remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. This dissertation develops a machine learning assisted framework to address these challenges throughout the battery lifecycle. A physics informed quality control model predicts long-term degradation from limited early-cycle data, while a generative learning based residual value assessment method enables rapid and accurate evaluation of retired batteries under random conditions. A federated learning strategy achieves privacy preserving and high precision cathode material sorting, supporting efficient recycling. Furthermore, a unified diagnostics and prognostics framework based on correlation alignment enhances adaptability across tasks such as state of health estimation, state of charge estimation, and remaining useful life prediction under varied testing protocols. Collectively, these contributions advance sustainable battery management by integrating physics, data generation, privacy preserving collaboration, and adaptive learning, offering methodological innovations to promote circular economy and global carbon neutrality.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are crucial for the success of deep neural networks, but labeling data can be prohibitively expensive in domains such as medical imaging. This work tackles the subset selection problem: selecting a small set of the most informative examples from a large unlabeled pool for annotation. We propose a simple and effective method that combines feature norms, randomization, and orthogonality (via the Gram-Schmidt process) to select diverse and informative samples. Feature norms serve as a proxy for informativeness, while randomization and orthogonalization reduce redundancy and encourage coverage of the feature space. Extensive experiments on image and text benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet, OrganAMNIST, and Yelp, show that our method consistently improves subset selection performance, both as a standalone approach and when integrated with existing techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be improved by aligning with human preferences through fine-tuning -- the so-called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the cost of fine-tuning an LLM is prohibitive for many users. Due to their ability to bypass LLM fine-tuning, prediction-time tokenwise reward-guided text generation (RGTG) methods have recently been proposed. They use a reward model trained on full sequences to score partial sequences during decoding in a bid to steer the generation towards sequences with high rewards. However, these methods have so far been only heuristically motivated and poorly analyzed. In this work, we show that reward models trained on full sequences are not compatible with scoring partial sequences. To alleviate this, we propose to train a Bradley-Terry reward model on partial sequences explicitly, and autoregressively sample from the implied tokenwise policy during decoding. We study the properties of this reward model and the resulting policy: we show that this policy is proportional to the ratio of two distinct RLHF policies. Our simple approach outperforms previous RGTG methods and performs similarly to strong offline baselines without large-scale LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Formal verification has emerged as a promising method to ensure the safety and reliability of neural networks. However, many relevant properties, such as fairness or global robustness, pertain to the entire input space. If one applies verification techniques naively, the neural network is checked even on inputs that do not occur in the real world and have no meaning. To tackle this shortcoming, we propose the VeriFlow architecture as a flow-based density model tailored to allow any verification approach to restrict its search to some data distribution of interest. We argue that our architecture is particularly well suited for this purpose because of two major properties. First, we show that the transformation that is defined by our model is piecewise affine. Therefore, the model allows the usage of verifiers based on constraint solving with linear arithmetic. Second, upper density level sets (UDL) of the data distribution are definable via linear constraints in the latent space. As a consequence, representations of UDLs specified by a given probability are effectively computable in the latent space. This property allows for effective verification with a fine-grained, probabilistically interpretable control of how a-typical the inputs subject to verification are.

Abstract: This study compared the performance of classical feature-based machine learning models (CMLs) and large language models (LLMs) in predicting COVID-19 mortality using high-dimensional tabular data from 9,134 patients across four hospitals. Seven CML models, including XGBoost and random forest (RF), were evaluated alongside eight LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Mistral-7b, which performed zero-shot classification on text-converted structured data. Additionally, Mistral- 7b was fine-tuned using the QLoRA approach. XGBoost and RF demonstrated superior performance among CMLs, achieving F1 scores of 0.87 and 0.83 for internal and external validation, respectively. GPT-4 led the LLM category with an F1 score of 0.43, while fine-tuning Mistral-7b significantly improved its recall from 1% to 79%, yielding a stable F1 score of 0.74 during external validation. Although LLMs showed moderate performance in zero-shot classification, fine-tuning substantially enhanced their effectiveness, potentially bridging the gap with CML models. However, CMLs still outperformed LLMs in handling high-dimensional tabular data tasks. This study highlights the potential of both CMLs and fine-tuned LLMs in medical predictive modeling, while emphasizing the current superiority of CMLs for structured data analysis.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that artificial neural networks like autoencoders or Siamese networks encode meaningful concepts in their latent spaces. However, there does not exist a comprehensive framework for retrieving this information in a human-readable form without prior knowledge. In quantitative disciplines concepts are typically formulated as equations. Hence, in order to extract these concepts, we introduce a framework for finding closed-form interpretations of neurons in latent spaces of artificial neural networks. The interpretation framework is based on embedding trained neural networks into an equivalence class of functions that encode the same concept. We interpret these neural networks by finding an intersection between the equivalence class and human-readable equations defined by a symbolic search space. Computationally, this framework is based on finding a symbolic expression whose normalized gradients match the normalized gradients of a specific neuron with respect to the input variables. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by retrieving invariants of matrices and conserved quantities of dynamical systems from latent spaces of Siamese neural networks.

Abstract: Spiking Graph Networks (SGNs) have demonstrated significant potential in graph classification by emulating brain-inspired neural dynamics to achieve energy-efficient computation. However, existing SGNs are generally constrained to in-distribution scenarios and struggle with distribution shifts. In this paper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a novel framework named Degree-Consicious Spiking Graph for Cross-Domain Adaptation (DeSGraDA). DeSGraDA enhances generalization across domains with three key components. First, we introduce the degree-conscious spiking representation module by adapting spike thresholds based on node degrees, enabling more expressive and structure-aware signal encoding. Then, we perform temporal distribution alignment by adversarially matching membrane potentials between domains, ensuring effective performance under domain shift while preserving energy efficiency. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two spaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance graph classification performance. Furthermore, we establish the first generalization bound for SGDA, providing theoretical insights into its adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that DeSGraDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both classification accuracy and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on massive, web-scale datasets. Training them from scratch is computationally expensive, and as a result, developers often prefer to make incremental updates to existing models. These updates often compose fine-tuning steps (to learn new concepts or improve model performance) with "unlearning" steps (to "forget" existing concepts, such as copyrighted works or explicit content). In this work, we demonstrate a critical and previously unknown vulnerability that arises in this paradigm: even under benign, non-adversarial conditions, fine-tuning a text-to-image diffusion model on seemingly unrelated images can cause it to "relearn" concepts that were previously "unlearned." We comprehensively investigate the causes and scope of this phenomenon, which we term concept resurgence, by performing a series of experiments which compose "concept unlearning" with subsequent fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion v1.4 and Stable Diffusion v2.1. Our findings underscore the fragility of composing incremental model updates, and raise serious new concerns about current approaches to ensuring the safety and alignment of text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to explicitly extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. As the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning underpins a wide range of further theoretical developments, our results are of foundational importance: A careful analysis of measurability aspects is essential, especially when the theorem is used in settings where measure-theoretic subtleties play a role. We particularly discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals. This class of hypothesis spaces covers all artificial neural networks for binary classification that use commonly employed activation functions like ReLU and the sigmoid function.

<title>Capacity-Aware Planning and Scheduling in Budget-Constrained Multi-Agent MDPs: A Meta-RL Approach</title>

Abstract: We study capacity- and budget-constrained multi-agent MDPs (CB-MA-MDPs), a class that captures many maintenance and scheduling tasks in which each agent can irreversibly fail and a planner must decide (i) when to apply a restorative action and (ii) which subset of agents to treat in parallel. The global budget limits the total number of restorations, while the capacity constraint bounds the number of simultaneous actions, turning na\"ive dynamic programming into a combinatorial search that scales exponentially with the number of agents. We propose a two-stage solution that remains tractable for large systems. First, a Linear Sum Assignment Problem (LSAP)-based grouping partitions the agents into r disjoint sets (r = capacity) that maximise diversity in expected time-to-failure, allocating budget to each set proportionally. Second, a meta-trained PPO policy solves each sub-MDP, leveraging transfer across groups to converge rapidly. To validate our approach, we apply it to the problem of scheduling repairs for a large team of industrial robots, constrained by a limited number of repair technicians and a total repair budget. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of maximizing the average uptime of the robot team, particularly for large team sizes. Lastly, we confirm the scalability of our approach through a computational complexity analysis across varying numbers of robots and repair technicians.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often struggle to generate rare compositions of concepts, e.g., objects with unusual attributes. In this paper, we show that the compositional generation power of diffusion models on such rare concepts can be significantly enhanced by the Large Language Model (LLM) guidance. We start with empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating that exposing frequent concepts relevant to the target rare concepts during the diffusion sampling process yields more accurate concept composition. Based on this, we propose a training-free approach, R2F, that plans and executes the overall rare-to-frequent concept guidance throughout the diffusion inference by leveraging the abundant semantic knowledge in LLMs. Our framework is flexible across any pre-trained diffusion models and LLMs, and can be seamlessly integrated with the region-guided diffusion approaches. Extensive experiments on three datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, RareBench, containing various prompts with rare compositions of concepts, R2F significantly surpasses existing models including SD3.0 and FLUX by up to 28.1%p in T2I alignment.

<title>Machine Unlearning for Speaker-Agnostic Detection of Gender-Based Violence Condition in Speech</title>

Abstract: Gender-based violence is a pervasive public health issue that severely impacts women's mental health, often leading to conditions such as in anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse. Identifying the combination of these various mental health conditions could then point to someone who is a victim of gender-based violence. And while speech-based artificial intelligence tools show as a promising solution for mental health screening, their performance often deteriorates when encountering speech from previously unseen speakers, a sign that speaker traits may be confounding factors. This study introduces a speaker-agnostic approach to detecting the gender-based violence victim condition from speech, aiming to develop robust artificial intelligence models capable of generalizing across speakers. By employing domain-adversarial training, we reduce the influence of speaker identity on model predictions, we achieve a 26.95% relative reduction in speaker identification accuracy while improving gender-based violence victim condition classification accuracy by 6.37% (relative). These results suggest that our models effectively capture paralinguistic biomarkers linked to the gender-based violence victim condition, rather than speaker-specific traits. Additionally, the model's predictions show moderate correlation with pre-clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, supporting the relevance of speech as a non-invasive tool for mental health monitoring. This work lays the foundation for ethical, privacy-preserving artificial intelligence systems to support clinical screening of gender-based violence survivors.

<title>How Strategic Agents Respond: Comparing Analytical Models with LLM-Generated Responses in Strategic Classification</title>

Abstract: When ML algorithms are deployed to automate human-related decisions, human agents may learn the underlying decision policies and adapt their behavior. Strategic Classification (SC) has emerged as a framework for studying this interaction between agents and decision-makers to design more trustworthy ML systems. Prior theoretical models in SC assume that agents are perfectly or approximately rational and respond to decision policies by optimizing their utility. However, the growing prevalence of LLMs raises the possibility that real-world agents may instead rely on these tools for strategic advice. This shift prompts two questions: (i) Can LLMs generate effective and socially responsible strategies in SC settings? (ii) Can existing SC theoretical models accurately capture agent behavior when agents follow LLM-generated advice? To investigate these questions, we examine five critical SC scenarios: hiring, loan applications, school admissions, personal income, and public assistance programs. We simulate agents with diverse profiles who interact with three commercial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5), following their suggestions on effort allocations on features. We compare the resulting agent behaviors with the best responses in existing SC models. Our findings show that: (i) Even without access to the decision policy, LLMs can generate effective strategies that improve both agents' scores and qualification; (ii) At the population level, LLM-guided effort allocation strategies yield similar or even higher score improvements, qualification rates, and fairness metrics as those predicted by the SC theoretical model, suggesting that the theoretical model may still serve as a reasonable proxy for LLM-influenced behavior; and (iii) At the individual level, LLMs tend to produce more diverse and balanced effort allocations than theoretical models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) bandits provide a powerful framework for performing blackbox optimization of unknown functions. The characteristics of the unknown function depends heavily on the assumed GP prior. Most work in the literature assume that this prior is known but in practice this seldom holds. Instead, practitioners often rely on maximum likelihood estimation to select the hyperparameters of the prior - which lacks theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose two algorithms for joint prior selection and regret minimization in GP bandits based on GP Thompson sampling (GP-TS): Prior-Elimination GP-TS (PE-GP-TS) and HyperPrior GP-TS (HP-GP-TS). We theoretically analyze the algorithms and establish upper bounds for their respective regret. In addition, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to the alternatives through experiments with synthetic and real-world data.

Abstract: Dense process rewards have proven a more effective alternative to the sparse outcome-level rewards in the inference-time scaling of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks requiring complex multi-step reasoning. While dense rewards also offer an appealing choice for the reinforcement learning (RL) of LLMs since their fine-grained rewards have the potential to address some inherent issues of outcome rewards, such as training efficiency and credit assignment, this potential remains largely unrealized. This can be primarily attributed to the challenges of training process reward models (PRMs) online, where collecting high-quality process labels is prohibitively expensive, making them particularly vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards), which enables online PRM updates using only policy rollouts and outcome labels through implict process rewards. PRIME combines well with various advantage functions and forgoes the dedicated reward model training phrase that existing approaches require, substantially reducing the development overhead. We demonstrate PRIME's effectiveness on competitional math and coding. Starting from Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, PRIME achieves a 15.1% average improvement across several key reasoning benchmarks over the SFT model. Notably, our resulting model, Eurus-2-7B-PRIME, surpasses Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on seven reasoning benchmarks with 10% of its training data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms and delivers high-quality solutions in real-time. We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to existing DT and offline RL baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in prior offline and online RL approaches.

Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space}, the natural domain for periodic crystals, and construct a Fourier series representation from fractional coordinates and reciprocal lattice vectors with learnable filters. Building on this principle, we introduce the reciprocal space-based geometry network (\textbf{ReciNet}), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on standard benchmarks JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReciNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension to multi-property prediction with the mixture-of-experts, which demonstrates high computational efficiency and reveals positive transfer between correlated properties. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction.

Abstract: We study the theoretical foundations of composition in diffusion models, with a particular focus on out-of-distribution extrapolation and length-generalization. Prior work has shown that composing distributions via linear score combination can achieve promising results, including length-generalization in some cases (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). However, our theoretical understanding of how and why such compositions work remains incomplete. In fact, it is not even entirely clear what it means for composition to "work". This paper starts to address these fundamental gaps. We begin by precisely defining one possible desired result of composition, which we call projective composition. Then, we investigate: (1) when linear score combinations provably achieve projective composition, (2) whether reverse-diffusion sampling can generate the desired composition, and (3) the conditions under which composition fails. We connect our theoretical analysis to prior empirical observations where composition has either worked or failed, for reasons that were unclear at the time. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic to help predict the success or failure of new compositions.

<title>LDC-MTL: Balancing Multi-Task Learning through Scalable Loss Discrepancy Control</title>

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has been widely adopted for its ability to simultaneously learn multiple tasks. While existing gradient manipulation methods often yield more balanced solutions than simple scalarization-based approaches, they typically incur a significant computational overhead of $\mathcal{O}(K)$ in both time and memory, where $K$ is the number of tasks. In this paper, we propose LDC-MTL, a simple and scalable loss discrepancy control approach for MTL, formulated from a bilevel optimization perspective. Our method incorporates two key components: (i) a bilevel formulation for fine-grained loss discrepancy control, and (ii) a scalable first-order bilevel algorithm that requires only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and memory. Theoretically, we prove that LDC-MTL guarantees convergence not only to a stationary point of the bilevel problem with loss discrepancy control but also to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point for all $K$ loss functions under mild conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-task datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LDC-MTL in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: As a data-driven approach, offline MARL learns superior policies solely from offline datasets, ideal for domains rich in historical data but with high interaction costs and risks. However, most existing methods are task-specific, requiring retraining for new tasks, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose a task-efficient value-based multi-task offline MARL algorithm, Skill-Discovery Conservative Q-Learning (SD-CQL). Unlike existing methods decoding actions from skills via behavior cloning, SD-CQL discovers skills in a latent space by reconstructing the next observation, evaluates fixed and variable actions separately, and uses conservative Q-learning with local value calibration to select the optimal action for each skill. It eliminates the need for local-global alignment and enables strong multi-task generalization from limited, small-scale source tasks. Substantial experiments on StarCraft II demonstrate the superior generalization performance and task-efficiency of SD-CQL. It achieves the best performance on $\textbf{13}$ out of $14$ task sets, with up to $\textbf{68.9%}$ improvement on individual task sets.

Abstract: Structured data, such as graphs, is vital in machine learning due to its capacity to capture complex relationships and interactions. In recent years, the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance has attracted growing interest because it enables the comparison of structured data by jointly accounting for feature similarity and geometric structure. However, as a variant of optimal transport (OT), classical FGW assumes an equal mass constraint on the compared data. In this work, we relax this mass constraint and propose the Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (FPGW) framework, which extends FGW to accommodate unbalanced data. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between FPGW and FGW and prove the metric properties of FPGW. Numerically, we introduce Frank-Wolfe solvers and Sinkhorn solvers for the proposed FPGW framework. Finally, we evaluate the FPGW distance through graph matching, graph classification and graph clustering experiments, demonstrating its robust performance.

Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG tokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from single-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a dual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif representations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight transformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study demonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and multi-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to 17% improvement in Cohen's Kappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play component, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models, including BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel level rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the potential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which differs from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration, recording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by 14%. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative, frequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation quality and interpretability.

Abstract: Representation Engineering (RepE) is a novel paradigm for controlling the behavior of LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that modify inputs or fine-tune the model, RepE directly manipulates the model's internal representations. As a result, it may offer more effective, interpretable, data-efficient, and flexible control over models' behavior. We present the first comprehensive survey of RepE for LLMs, reviewing the rapidly growing literature to address key questions: What RepE methods exist and how do they differ? For what concepts and problems has RepE been applied? What are the strengths and weaknesses of RepE compared to other methods? To answer these, we propose a unified framework describing RepE as a pipeline comprising representation identification, operationalization, and control. We posit that while RepE methods offer significant potential, challenges remain, including managing multiple concepts, ensuring reliability, and preserving models' performance. Towards improving RepE, we identify opportunities for experimental and methodological improvements and construct a guide for best practices.

Abstract: Causal discovery is a difficult problem that typically relies on strong assumptions on the data-generating model, such as non-Gaussianity. In practice, many modern applications provide multiple related views of the same system, which has rarely been considered for causal discovery. Here, we leverage this multi-view structure to achieve causal discovery with weak assumptions. We propose a multi-view linear Structural Equation Model (SEM) that extends the well-known framework of non-Gaussian disturbances by alternatively leveraging correlation over views. We prove the identifiability of the model for acyclic SEMs. Subsequently, we propose several multi-view causal discovery algorithms, inspired by single-view algorithms (DirectLiNGAM, PairwiseLiNGAM, and ICA-LiNGAM). The new methods are validated through simulations and applications on neuroimaging data, where they enable the estimation of causal graphs between brain regions.

Abstract: In contrast to the assumptions of most existing Electromigration (EM) analysis tools, the evolution of EM-induced stress is inherently non-deterministic, influenced by factors such as input current fluctuations and manufacturing non-idealities. Traditional approaches for estimating stress variations typically involve computationally expensive and inefficient Monte Carlo simulations with industrial solvers, which quantify variations using mean and variance metrics. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning-based framework, termed BPINN-EM- Post, for efficient stochastic analysis of EM-induced post-voiding aging processes. For the first time, our new approach integrates closed-form analytical solutions with a Bayesian Physics- Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework to accelerate the analysis. The closed-form solutions enforce physical laws at the individual wire segment level, while the BPINN ensures that physics constraints at inter-segment junctions are satisfied and stochastic behaviors are accurately modeled. By reducing the number of variables in the loss functions through utilizing analytical solutions, our method significantly improves training efficiency without accuracy loss and naturally incorporates variational effects. Additionally, the analytical solutions effectively address the challenge of incorporating initial stress distributions in interconnect structures during post-void stress calculations. Numerical results demonstrate that BPINN-EM-Post achieves over 240x and more than 67x speedup compared to Monte Carlo simulations using the FEM-based COMSOL solver and FDM-based EMSpice, respectively, with marginal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Imputation of random or non-random missing data is a long-standing research topic and a crucial application for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, with the advent of modern communication technologies such as Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS), traffic data collection has introduced new challenges in random missing value imputation and increasing demands for spatiotemporal dependency modelings. To address these issues, we propose a novel spatiotemporal traffic imputation method based on a Multimode Nonlinear Transformed Tensor Nuclear Norm (MNT-TNN), which can effectively capture the intrinsic multimode spatiotemporal correlations and low-rankness of the traffic tensor, represented as location $\times$ location $\times$ time. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, we design a proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm with theoretical convergence guarantees. We also suggest an Augmented Transform-based Tensor Nuclear Norm Families (ATTNNs) framework to enhance the imputation results of TTNN techniques, especially at very high miss rates. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed MNT-TNN and ATTNNs can outperform the compared state-of-the-art imputation methods, completing the benchmark of random missing traffic value imputation.

To validate our theory, we conduct disentanglement experiments across diverse tasks and modalities, including subspace recovery in latent subspace Gaussian mixture models, image colorization, image denoising, and voice conversion for speech classification. Additionally, our experiments show that training strategies inspired by our theory, such as style guidance regularization, consistently enhance disentanglement performance.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art researches indicate that analytic algorithms are promising in handling complex floorplanning scenarios. However, it is challenging to generate compact floorplans with excellent wirelength optimization effect due to the local convergence of gradient-based optimization algorithms designed for constructed smooth optimization models. Accordingly, we propose to construct a nonsmooth analytic floorplanning model addressed by the conjugate subgradient algorithm (CSA), which is accelerated by a population-based scheme adaptively regulating the stepsize with the assistance of Q-learning. In this way, the proposed CSA assisted by Q-learning (CSAQ) can strike a good balance on exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on the MCNC and GSRC benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed fixed-outline floorplanning algorithm based on CSAQ (CSF) not only address global floorplanning effectively, but also get legal floorplans more efficiently than the constraint graph-based legalization algorithm as well as its improved variants. It is also demonstrated that the CSF is competitive to the state-of-the-art algorithms on floorplanning scenarios only containing hard modules.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.

<title>Sparsity Forcing: Reinforcing Token Sparsity of MLLMs</title>

Abstract: Sparse attention mechanisms aim to reduce computational overhead with minimal accuracy loss by selectively processing salient tokens. Despite their effectiveness, most methods merely exploit a model's inherent sparsity and thus plateau at moderate budgets (about 50\% token reduction), with little headroom to push budget lower without hurting accuracy. Other approaches attempt to enforce sparsity through trainable sparse attention or sharpness-inducing regularizers, but these either fix rigid patterns that ignore input and layer dynamics, or optimize proxy objectives without direct control over token budgets. In this paper, we explicitly reinforce token sparsity in well-posed multimodal large language models (MLLMs) through a simple RL-based post-training framework named \textit{Sparsity Forcing}. Our method explores the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by running multiple rollouts with different token budgets, where both efficiency (token reduction ratio) and performance (answer correctness) are formulated as joint rewards. By contrasting rollouts within each group, the more efficient and correct answer is rewarded while less efficient or incorrect ones are penalized, thereby turning token saving into an end-to-end, inference-consistent optimization objective. Across thirteen image and video benchmarks, Sparsity Forcing raises token reduction ratio on Qwen2-VL/Qwen2.5-VL from 20\% to 75\% with minimal accuracy decline, significantly reducing long-context inference memory by up to 3$\times$ while speeding up decoding by up to 3.3$\times$.

Abstract: Advances in neural operators have introduced discretization invariant surrogate models for PDEs on general geometries, yet many approaches struggle to encode local geometric structure and variable domains efficiently. We introduce enf2enf, a neural field approach for predicting steady-state PDEs with geometric variability. Our method encodes geometries into latent features anchored at specific spatial locations, preserving locality throughout the network. These local representations are combined with global parameters and decoded to continuous physical fields, enabling effective modeling of complex shape variations. Experiments on aerodynamic and structural benchmarks demonstrate competitive or superior performance compared to graph-based, neural operator, and recent neural field methods, with real-time inference and efficient scaling to high-resolution meshes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance while also increasing computational demands. While federated and distributed setups address these issues, their structure is vulnerable to malicious influences. In this paper, we address a specific threat, Byzantine attacks, where compromised clients inject adversarial updates to derail global convergence. We combine the trust scores concept with trial function methodology to dynamically filter outliers. Our methods address the critical limitations of previous approaches, allowing functionality even when Byzantine nodes are in the majority. Moreover, our algorithms adapt to widely used scaled methods like Adam and RMSProp, as well as practical scenarios, including local training and partial participation. We validate the robustness of our methods by conducting extensive experiments on both synthetic and real ECG data collected from medical institutions. Furthermore, we provide a broad theoretical analysis of our algorithms and their extensions to aforementioned practical setups. The convergence guarantees of our methods are comparable to those of classical algorithms developed without Byzantine interference.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) as foundation models have significantly enhanced performance across a wide range of visual and textual tasks, without requiring large-scale training from scratch for downstream tasks. However, these deterministic VLMs fail to capture the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in natural language and visual data. Recent probabilistic post-hoc adaptation methods address this by mapping deterministic embeddings onto probability distributions; however, existing approaches do not account for the asymmetric uncertainty structure of the modalities, and the constraint that meaningful deterministic embeddings reside on a unit hypersphere, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we address the asymmetric uncertainty structure inherent in textual and visual data, and propose AsymVLM to build probabilistic embeddings from pre-trained VLMs on the unit hypersphere, enabling uncertainty quantification. We validate the effectiveness of the probabilistic embeddings on established benchmarks, and present comprehensive ablation studies demonstrating the inherent nature of asymmetry in the uncertainty structure of textual and visual data.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid growth of model parameters, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become essential for adapting large models to diverse downstream tasks under constrained computational resources. Within this paradigm, orthogonal fine-tuning and its variants preserve semantic representations of pre-trained models, but struggle to achieve both expressiveness and efficiency in terms of parameter counts, memory, and computation. To overcome this limitation, we propose efficient Orthogonal Fine-Tuning with Principal Subspace adaptation (PSOFT), which confines orthogonal transformations to the principal subspace of pre-trained weights. Specifically, PSOFT constructs this subspace via matrix decomposition to enable compatible transformations with higher effective rank, establishes a theoretical condition that strictly maintains the geometry of this subspace for essential semantic preservation, and introduces efficient tunable vectors that gradually relax orthogonality during training to enhance adaptability. Extensive experiments on 35 NLP and CV tasks across four representative models demonstrate that PSOFT offers a practical and scalable solution to simultaneously achieve semantic preservation, expressiveness, and multi-dimensional efficiency in PEFT. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/fei407/PSOFT.

<title>Quantization Meets Reasoning: Exploring and Mitigating Degradation of Low-Bit LLMs in Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) is a practical route to deploy reasoning-capable LLMs under tight memory and latency budgets, yet it can markedly impair mathematical reasoning (drops up to 69.81% in our harder settings). We address two deployment-critical questions with process-level precision: Where along a step-structured solution does degradation first arise? How to mitigate it while staying in the low-bit regime? Across widely used PTQ methods (AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant), open-source model families (Qwen, LLaMA; 0.5--7B), and math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, AIME), we perform format-aligned chain-of-thought with step-aligned attribution and uncover two robust regularities: (i) PTQ disproportionately elevates method and execution errors relative to high-level conceptual mistakes; and (ii) failures emerge early, with the first vulnerable step flipping and cascading to the final answer. These regularities suggest a general intervention principle: restore local token-level margins exactly at the earliest failure frontier. We instantiate this principle as a lightweight measure$\rightarrow$locate$\rightarrow$restore loop that operates directly on the quantized model: detect the first faulty step, construct our "Silver Bullet" datasets, and apply small-scale supervised/preference tuning. In our settings, as few as 332 curated examples and 3--5 minutes of compute on a single GPU recover 4-bit weight math reasoning toward the full-precision baseline while preserving PTQ efficiency. Our framework is quantizer- and architecture-agnostic within the evaluated regimes, and turns low-bit degradation from a global accuracy problem into a local, reproducible process intervention.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their output quality remains inconsistent across various application scenarios, making it difficult to identify trustworthy responses, especially in complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. In this paper, we propose a Token-level Uncertainty estimation framework for Reasoning (TokUR) that enables LLMs to self-assess and self-improve their responses in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we introduce low-rank random weight perturbation during LLM decoding to generate predictive distributions for token-level uncertainty estimation, and we aggregate these uncertainty quantities to capture the semantic uncertainty of generated responses. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets of varying difficulty demonstrate that TokUR exhibits a strong correlation with answer correctness and model robustness, and the uncertainty signals produced by TokUR can be leveraged to enhance the model's reasoning performance at test time. These results highlight the effectiveness of TokUR as a principled and scalable approach for improving the reliability and interpretability of LLMs in challenging reasoning tasks.

<title>Feature Hedging: Correlated Features Break Narrow Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: It is assumed that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic activations into interpretable linear directions, as long as the activations are composed of sparse linear combinations of underlying features. However, we find that if an SAE is more narrow than the number of underlying "true features" on which it is trained, and there is correlation between features, the SAE will merge components of correlated features together, thus destroying monosemanticity. In LLM SAEs, these two conditions are almost certainly true. This phenomenon, which we call feature hedging, is caused by SAE reconstruction loss, and is more severe the narrower the SAE. In this work, we introduce the problem of feature hedging and study it both theoretically in toy models and empirically in SAEs trained on LLMs. We suspect that feature hedging may be one of the core reasons that SAEs consistently underperform supervised baselines. Finally, we use our understanding of feature hedging to propose an improved variant of matryoshka SAEs. Importantly, our work shows that SAE width is not a neutral hyperparameter: narrower SAEs suffer more from hedging than wider SAEs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has advanced the capabilities and transparency of language models (LMs); however, reasoning chains can contain inaccurate statements that reduce performance and trustworthiness. To address this, we propose to augment each reasoning step in a CoT with a latent veracity (or correctness) variable. To efficiently explore this expanded space, we introduce Veracity Search (VS), a discrete search algorithm over veracity assignments. It performs otherwise intractable inference in the posterior distribution over latent veracity values by leveraging the LM's joint likelihood over veracity and the final answer as a proxy reward. This efficient inference-time verification method facilitates supervised fine-tuning of an Amortized Veracity Inference (AVI) machine by providing pseudo-labels for veracity. AVI generalizes VS, enabling accurate zero-shot veracity inference in novel contexts. Empirical results demonstrate that VS reliably identifies errors in logical (ProntoQA), mathematical (GSM8K), and commonsense (CommonsenseQA) reasoning benchmarks, with AVI achieving comparable zero-shot accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of latent veracity inference for providing feedback during self-correction and self-improvement.

Abstract: Invariant representations are core to representation learning, yet a central challenge remains: uncovering invariants that are stable and transferable without suppressing task-relevant signals. This raises fundamental questions, requiring further inquiry, about the appropriate level of abstraction at which such invariants should be defined and which aspects of a system they should characterize. Interpretation of the environment relies on abstract knowledge structures to make sense of the current state, which leads to interactions, essential drivers of learning and knowledge acquisition. Interpretation operates at the level of higher-order relational knowledge; hence, we propose that invariant structures must be where knowledge resides, specifically as partitions defined by the closure of relational paths within an abstract knowledge space. These partitions serve as the core invariant representations, forming the structural substrate where knowledge is stored and learning occurs. On the other hand, inter-partition connectors enable the deployment of these knowledge partitions encoding task-relevant transitions. Thus, invariant partitions provide the foundational primitives of structured representation. We formalize the computational foundations for structured relational representations of the invariant partitions based on closed semiring, a relational algebraic structure.

Abstract: Scaling laws in deep learning -- empirical power-law relationships linking model performance to resource growth -- have emerged as simple yet striking regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training. In this work, we describe a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics: we identify two novel \textit{dynamical} scaling laws that govern how performance evolves as function of different norm-based complexity measures. Combined, our new laws recover the well-known scaling for test error at convergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a single-layer perceptron trained with logistic loss, where we derive the new dynamical scaling laws, and we explain them through the implicit bias induced by gradient-based training.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in cross-modal tasks through large-scale contrastive pre-training. To adapt these large transformer-based models efficiently for downstream tasks, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like (Low-Rank Adaptation) LoRA have emerged as scalable alternatives to full fine-tuning, especially in few-shot scenarios. However, like traditional deep neural networks, VLMs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations can significantly degrade model performance. Adversarial training remains the most effective strategy for improving model robustness in PEFT. In this work, we propose AdvCLIP-LoRA, to our knowledge the first method designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of CLIP models fine-tuned with LoRA in few-shot settings. Our method formulates training as a minimax optimization over low-rank adapters and adversarial perturbations, enabling robust adaptation with a small trainable footprint. Across eight datasets and two backbones (ViT-B/16 and ViT-B/32), AdvCLIP-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot classification, adversarial base-to-new generalization, and cross-dataset transfer, delivering higher adversarial robustness than prompt tuning baselines without sacrificing much clean accuracy. These findings highlight AdvCLIP-LoRA as a practical approach for robust adaptation of VLMs in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent stochastic differential equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image restoration tasks. Its general applicability on image-conditioned generation is also demonstrated via qualitative results on image-to-image translation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Algolzw/FoD.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. Recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine within the Muon algorithm for training deep neural networks. However, the requirements of this application differ sharply from classical settings: deep learning demands GPU-friendly algorithms that prioritize high throughput over high precision. We introduce Polar Express, a new method for computing the polar decomposition. Like Newton-Schulz and other classical polynomial methods, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it very efficient on GPUs. Inspired by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem. We prove that this strategy minimizes error in a worst-case sense, allowing Polar Express to converge as rapidly as possible both in the early iterations and asymptotically. We also address finite-precision issues, making it practical to use in bfloat16. When integrated into the Muon training framework, our method leads to consistent improvements in validation loss when training a GPT-2 model on one billion tokens from the FineWeb dataset, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Abstract: We present SPAR, a framework for self-supervised placement-aware representation learning in distributed sensing. Distributed sensing spans applications where multiple spatially distributed and multimodal sensors jointly observe an environment, from vehicle monitoring to human activity recognition and earthquake localization. A central challenge shared by this wide spectrum of applications, is that observed signals are inseparably shaped by sensor placements, including their spatial locations and structural roles. However, existing pretraining methods remain largely placement-agnostic. SPAR addresses this gap through a unifying principle: the duality between signals and positions. Guided by this principle, SPAR introduces spatial and structural positional embeddings together with dual reconstruction objectives, explicitly modeling how observing positions and observed signals shape each other. Placement is thus treated not as auxiliary metadata but as intrinsic to representation learning. SPAR is theoretically supported by analyses from information theory and occlusion-invariant learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SPAR achieves superior robustness and generalization across various modalities, placements, and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Transformer LLMs have been shown to exhibit strong reasoning ability that scales with inference-time compute, most prominently through token-space "thinking" chains of thought. A growing line of work pushes extra computation into the model's latent space, which we term Auxiliary Latent-Space Computation (ALSC). Existing ALSC methods largely fall into three buckets: (i) token-mediated latent rollouts, (ii) residual/activation steering, and (iii) memory (KV) compression. An underexplored alternative is memory consolidation/reconsolidation, two processes in the brain that are responsible for stabilising newly formed memory traces, and, upon recall, transiently rendering established traces plastic such they can integrate new contextual information before restabilising. In Transformer LLMs, this can be seen as analogous to performing in-place rewrites of new KV segments, and rewrites of recalled past segments. In this work, we give a theoretical justification as to why memory (re)consolidation via KV cache rewrites is beneficial for improved reasoning. We do this through the lens of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation emerges from an optimal balance between input information compression and retention of predictive information in latent representations. We then introduce the Bottlenecked Transformer, which augments a backbone LLM with a Cache Processor, an auxiliary Transformer that performs periodic, non-causal, in-place KV rewrites at newline-delimited reasoning step boundaries. The Processor consolidates recently written KV entries and reconsolidates a small, top-k attention-selected set of prior entries. We evaluate our Bottlenecked Transformer architecture on math reasoning benchmarks. Our model sees consistent performance gains over vanilla Transformers and pause-token augmented baselines, with gains of up to +6.6pp for selected tasks/backbones.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group-Regularized Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical limitations due to their reliance on sparse outcome-based rewards and inadequate mechanisms for incentivizing exploration. These limitations result in inefficient guidance for reasoning. Specifically, sparse rewards fail to deliver sufficient feedback, particularly for challenging problems. Furthermore, such rewards induce systematic biases that prioritize exploitation of familiar trajectories over novel solution discovery. These shortcomings critically hinder performance in complex reasoning tasks, which inherently demand iterative refinement across intermediate steps. To address these challenges, we propose an Intrinsic Motivation guidEd exploratioN meThOd foR LLM Reasoning (i-MENTOR), a method designed to deliver dense rewards and amplify exploration in the RL-based paradigm. i-MENTOR introduces three innovations: trajectory-aware exploration rewards that mitigate bias in token-level strategies while maintaining computational efficiency; error-conditioned reward allocation to ensure efficient exploration on challenging samples while intrinsically stabilizing training; and advantage-preserving integration that maintains advantage distribution integrity while incorporating exploratory guidance. Experiments across 4 public datasets demonstrate i-MENTOR's effectiveness, achieving a 22.23\% improvement on AIME 2024.

<title>Can LLMs Alleviate Catastrophic Forgetting in Graph Continual Learning? A Systematic Study</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, real-world data, including graph-structure data, often arrives in a streaming manner, which means that learning systems need to continuously acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. Although substantial existing works attempt to address catastrophic forgetting in graph machine learning, they are all based on training from scratch with streaming data. With the rise of pretrained models, an increasing number of studies have leveraged their strong generalization ability for continual learning. Therefore, in this work, we attempt to answer whether large language models (LLMs) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in Graph Continual Learning (GCL). We first point out that current experimental setups for GCL have significant flaws, as the evaluation stage may lead to task ID leakage. Then, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in more realistic scenarios and find that even minor modifications can lead to outstanding results. Finally, based on extensive experiments, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, Simple Graph Continual Learning (SimGCL), that surpasses the previous state-of-the-art GNN-based baseline by around 20% under the rehearsal-free constraint. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use benchmark LLM4GCL for training and evaluating existing GCL methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/ZhixunLEE/LLM4GCL.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for large language models (LLMs), such as LoRA and PiSSA, constrain model updates to low-rank subspaces, limiting their expressiveness and leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks. To address this, we introduce High-rank Distributed PiSSA (HD-PiSSA), a distributed PEFT approach that initializes orthogonal adapters across different devices and aggregates their delta updates collectively on W for fine-tuning. Unlike Data Parallel LoRA or PiSSA, which maintain identical adapters across all devices, HD-PiSSA assigns different principal components of the pre-trained weights to each GPU, significantly expanding the range of update directions. This results in over 16x higher effective updated ranks than data-parallel LoRA or PiSSA when fine-tuning on 8 GPUs with the same per-device adapter rank. Empirically, we evaluate HD-PiSSA across various challenging downstream tasks, including mathematics, code generation, and multi-task learning. In the multi-task setting, HD-PiSSA achieves average gains of 10.0 absolute points (14.63%) over LoRA and 4.98 points (6.60%) over PiSSA across 12 benchmarks, demonstrating its benefits from the extra optimization flexibility.

Abstract: Post-hoc interpretability methods typically attribute a model's behavior to its components, data, or training trajectory in isolation. This leads to explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers broader insights, such approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all these perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to realistic settings like AdamW. We empirically validate that a CNN and a Transformer are accurately replicated by this reformulation. Second, we derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature maps. Their effectiveness for parameter pruning is comparable to existing methods, demonstrating their value for model component attribution. Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking. Our findings support previously proposed stages of Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded, unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.

<title>Beyond the Proxy: Trajectory-Distilled Guidance for Offline GFlowNet Training</title>

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective at sampling diverse, high-reward objects, but in many real-world settings where new reward queries are infeasible, they must be trained from offline datasets. The prevailing proxy-based training methods are susceptible to error propagation, while existing proxy-free approaches often use coarse constraints that limit exploration. To address these issues, we propose Trajectory-Distilled GFlowNet (TD-GFN), a novel proxy-free training framework. TD-GFN learns dense, transition-level edge rewards from offline trajectories via inverse reinforcement learning to provide rich structural guidance for efficient exploration. Crucially, to ensure robustness, these rewards are used indirectly to guide the policy through DAG pruning and prioritized backward sampling of training trajectories. This ensures that final gradient updates depend only on ground-truth terminal rewards from the dataset, thereby preventing the error propagation. Experiments show that TD-GFN significantly outperforms a broad range of existing baselines in both convergence speed and final sample quality, establishing a more robust and efficient paradigm for offline GFlowNet training.

Abstract: While the performance of machine learning systems has experienced significant improvement in recent years, relatively little attention has been paid to the fundamental question: to what extent can we improve our models? This paper provides a means of answering this question in the setting of binary classification, which is practical and theoretically supported. We extend a previous work that utilizes soft labels for estimating the Bayes error, the optimal error rate, in two important ways. First, we theoretically investigate the properties of the bias of the hard-label-based estimator discussed in the original work. We reveal that the decay rate of the bias is adaptive to how well the two class-conditional distributions are separated, and it can decay significantly faster than the previous result suggested as the number of hard labels per instance grows. Second, we tackle a more challenging problem setting: estimation with corrupted soft labels. One might be tempted to use calibrated soft labels instead of clean ones. However, we reveal that calibration guarantee is not enough, that is, even perfectly calibrated soft labels can result in a substantially inaccurate estimate. Then, we show that isotonic calibration can provide a statistically consistent estimator under an assumption weaker than that of the previous work. Our method is instance-free, i.e., we do not assume access to any input instances. This feature allows it to be adopted in practical scenarios where the instances are not available due to privacy issues. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show the validity of our methods and theory.

Abstract: This work proposes a framework LGKDE that learns kernel density estimation for graphs. The key challenge in graph density estimation lies in effectively capturing both structural patterns and semantic variations while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Combining graph kernels and kernel density estimation (KDE) is a standard approach to graph density estimation, but has unsatisfactory performance due to the handcrafted and fixed features of kernels. Our method LGKDE leverages graph neural networks to represent each graph as a discrete distribution and utilizes maximum mean discrepancy to learn the graph metric for multi-scale KDE, where all parameters are learned by maximizing the density of graphs relative to the density of their well-designed perturbed counterparts. The perturbations are conducted on both node features and graph spectra, which helps better characterize the boundary of normal density regions. Theoretically, we establish consistency and convergence guarantees for LGKDE, including bounds on the mean integrated squared error, robustness, and generalization. We validate LGKDE by demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the underlying density of synthetic graph distributions and applying it to graph anomaly detection across diverse benchmark datasets. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that LGKDE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on most benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics from limited data with unknown physics is challenging. Existing neural PDE solvers either require large datasets or rely on known physics (e.g., PDE residuals or handcrafted stencils), leading to limited applicability. To address these challenges, we propose Spectral-Inspired Neural Operator (SINO), which can model complex systems from just 2-5 trajectories, without requiring explicit PDE terms. Specifically, SINO automatically captures both local and global spatial derivatives from frequency indices, enabling a compact representation of the underlying differential operators in physics-agnostic regimes. To model nonlinear effects, it employs a Pi-block that performs multiplicative operations on spectral features, complemented by a low-pass filter to suppress aliasing. Extensive experiments on both 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks demonstrate that SINO achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of 1-2 orders of magnitude in accuracy. Particularly, with only 5 training trajectories, SINO outperforms data-driven methods trained on 1000 trajectories and remains predictive on challenging out-of-distribution cases where other methods fail.

Abstract: Preference learning has become a central technique for aligning generative models with human expectations. Recently, it has been extended to diffusion models through methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, existing approaches such as Diffusion-DPO suffer from two key challenges: timestep-dependent instability, caused by a mismatch between the reverse and forward diffusion processes and by high gradient variance in early noisy timesteps, and off-policy bias arising from the mismatch between optimization and data collection policies. We begin by analyzing the reverse diffusion trajectory and observe that instability primarily occurs at early timesteps with low importance weights. To address these issues, we first propose DPO-C\&amp;M, a practical strategy that improves stability by clipping and masking uninformative timesteps while partially mitigating off-policy bias. Building on this, we introduce SDPO (Importance-Sampled Direct Preference Optimization), a principled framework that incorporates importance sampling into the objective to fully correct for off-policy bias and emphasize informative updates during the diffusion process. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B, CogVideoX-5B, and Wan2.1-1.3B demonstrate that both methods outperform standard Diffusion-DPO, with SDPO achieving superior VBench scores, human preference alignment, and training robustness. These results highlight the importance of timestep-aware, distribution-corrected optimization in diffusion-based preference learning.

Abstract: The goal of quantization is to produce a compressed model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as possible. To do this tractably, most quantization algorithms minimize the immediate activation error of each layer as a proxy for the end-to-end error. However, this ignores the effect of future layers, making it a poor proxy. In this work, we introduce Yet Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that directly considers the error at the network's output. YAQA introduces a series of theoretical results that culminate in the first end-to-end error bounds for quantization algorithms. First, we characterize the convergence time of adaptive rounding algorithms via the structure of their Hessian approximations. We then show that the end-to-end error can be bounded by the approximation's cosine similarity to the true Hessian. This admits a natural Kronecker-factored approximation with corresponding near-optimal Hessian sketches. YAQA is provably better than GPTQ/LDLQ and empirically reduces the error by $\approx 30\%$ over these methods. YAQA even achieves a lower error than quantization aware training. This translates to state of the art performance on downstream tasks, all while adding no inference overhead.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms solve TN-SS as a purely numerical optimization problem and require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world applications. In addition, existing methods ignore the valuable domain information inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM, which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function, but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures. Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical performance guarantees.

Abstract: Long-term forecasting of chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge due to the intrinsic sensitivity to initial conditions and the complex geometry of strange attractors. Conventional approaches, such as reservoir computing, typically require training data that incorporates long-term continuous dynamical behavior to comprehensively capture system dynamics. While advanced deep sequence models can capture transient dynamics within the training data, they often struggle to maintain predictive stability and dynamical coherence over extended horizons. Here, we propose PhyxMamba, a framework that integrates a Mamba-based state-space model with physics-informed principles to forecast long-term behavior of chaotic systems given short-term historical observations on their state evolution. We first reconstruct the attractor manifold with time-delay embeddings to extract global dynamical features. After that, we introduce a generative training scheme that enables Mamba to replicate the physical process. It is further augmented by multi-patch prediction and attractor geometry regularization for physical constraints, enhancing predictive accuracy and preserving key statistical properties of systems. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world chaotic systems demonstrate that PhyxMamba delivers superior forecasting accuracy and faithfully captures essential statistics from short-term historical observations.

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately, existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieves strong efficacy, with 50% sensitivity in predicting first cancer risks at 99% specificity cutoff, and outperforming feature-based tree models and both general and medical LLMs by up to 20% AUPRC. Despite significant demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: GCN-based traveling salesman problem (TSP) solvers face two critical challenges: poor cross-scale generalization for TSPs and high training costs. To address these challenges, we propose a Subgraph-Based Rescaling Graph Convolutional Network (RsGCN). Focusing on the scale-dependent features (i.e., features varied with problem scales) related to nodes and edges, we design the subgraph-based rescaling to normalize edge lengths of subgraphs. Under a unified subgraph perspective, RsGCN can efficiently learn scale-generalizable representations from small-scale TSPs at low cost. To exploit and assess the heatmaps generated by RsGCN, we design a Reconstruction-Based Search (RBS), in which a reconstruction process based on adaptive weight is incorporated to help avoid local optima. Based on a combined architecture of RsGCN and RBS, our solver achieves remarkable generalization and low training cost: with only 3 epochs of training on a mixed-scale dataset containing instances with up to 100 nodes, it can be generalized successfully to 10K-node instances without any fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate our advanced performance across uniform-distribution instances of 9 different scales from 20 to 10K nodes and 78 real-world instances from TSPLIB, while requiring the fewest learnable parameters and training epochs among neural competitors.

Abstract: The widespread utilization of language models in modern applications is inconceivable without Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques, such as low-rank adaptation ($\texttt{LoRA}$), which adds trainable adapters to selected layers. Although $\texttt{LoRA}$ may obtain accurate solutions, it requires significant memory to train large models and intuition on which layers to add adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel method, $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$, which overcomes this issue by adaptive selection of the most critical $\texttt{LoRA}$ heads throughout the optimization process. As a result, we can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining the capability to obtain consistent or even superior metric values. We conduct experiments for a series of competitive benchmarks and DeBERTa, BART, and Llama models, comparing our method with different adaptive approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of $\texttt{WeightLoRA}$ and the superior performance of $\texttt{WeightLoRA+}$ in almost all cases.

Abstract: Quite recently, large language models have made a significant breakthrough across various disciplines. However, training them is an extremely resource-intensive task, even for major players with vast computing resources. One of the methods gaining popularity in light of these challenges is Sign-SGD. This method can be applied both as a memory-efficient approach in single-node training and as a gradient compression technique in the distributed learning. Nevertheless, it is impossible to automatically determine the effective stepsize from the theoretical standpoint. Indeed, it depends on the parameters of the dataset to which we do not have access in the real-world learning paradigm. To address this issue, we design several variants of single-node deterministic Sign-SGD. We extend our approaches to practical scenarios: stochastic single-node and multi-node learning, methods with incorporated momentum. We conduct extensive experiments on real machine learning problems that emphasize the practical applicability of our ideas.

Abstract: We study $\perp$Grad, a geometry-aware modification to gradient-based optimization that constrains descent directions to address overconfidence, a key limitation of standard optimizers in uncertainty-critical applications. By enforcing orthogonality between gradient updates and weight vectors, $\perp$Grad alters optimization trajectories without architectural changes. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy while achieving statistically significant improvements in test loss ($p=0.05$), predictive entropy ($p=0.001$), and confidence measures. These effects show consistent trends across corruption levels and architectures. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic, incurs minimal overhead, and remains compatible with post-hoc calibration techniques.
  Theoretically, we characterize convergence and stationary points for a simplified $\perp$Grad variant, revealing that orthogonalization constrains loss reduction pathways to avoid confidence inflation and encourage decision-boundary improvements. Our findings suggest that geometric interventions in optimization can improve predictive uncertainty estimates at low computational cost.

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet, these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC.

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs) dominate modern graph learning. Typical efforts enhance MPGNN's expressive power by enriching the adjacency-based aggregation. In contrast, we introduce an efficient aggregation over walk incidence-based matrices that are constructed to deliberately trade off some expressivity for stronger and more structured inductive bias. Our approach allows for seamless scaling between classical message-passing and simpler methods based on walks. We rigorously characterize the expressive power at each intermediate step using homomorphism counts over a hierarchy of generalized caterpillar graphs. Based on this foundation, we propose Caterpillar GNNs, whose robust graph-level aggregation successfully tackles a benchmark specifically designed to challenge MPGNNs. Moreover, we demonstrate that, on real-world datasets, Caterpillar GNNs achieve comparable predictive performance while significantly reducing the number of nodes in the hidden layers of the computational graph.

Abstract: Aircraft trajectory modeling plays a crucial role in air traffic management (ATM) and is important for various downstream tasks, including conflict detection and landing time prediction. Dataset augmentation by adding synthetically generated trajectory data is necessary to develop a more robust aircraft trajectory model and ensure that the trajectory dataset is sufficient and balanced. We propose a novel framework called ATRADA for aircraft trajectory dataset augmentation. In the proposed framework, a Transformer encoder learns the underlying patterns in the original trajectory dataset and converts each data point into a context vector in the learned latent space. The converted dataset is projected to reduced dimensions using principal component analysis (PCA), and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the probability distribution of the data points in the reduced-dimensional space. Finally, new samples are drawn from the fitted GMM, the dimension of the samples is reverted to the original dimension, and the samples are decoded with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Several experiments demonstrate that the framework effectively generates new, high-quality synthetic aircraft trajectory data, which were compared to the results of several baselines.

Abstract: Training large language models typically demands extensive GPU memory and substantial financial investment, which poses a barrier for many small- to medium-sized teams. In this paper, we propose a full-parameter pre-training and fine-tuning framework based on block coordinate descent (BCD), enhanced with engineering optimizations, to enable efficient training of large-scale models on cost-effective RTX 4090, A100 and A800 GPU clusters. Under identical hardware configurations, we reduce the training cost of a 7B model to 33% on A100/A800 and only 2.6% on RTX 4090, compared to standard full-parameter training. It also enables large models previously restricted to A100 clusters to be trained on RTX 4090 without degrading performance. BCD achieves comparable or better accuracy than full-parameter and fine-tuning methods at most cases, with lower GPU consumption and improved hardware utilization.

Abstract: Latent-space monitors aim to detect undesirable behaviours in Large Language Models by leveraging their internal representations rather than relying solely on black-box outputs. These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions. However, these monitors may themselves become training signals, for example, by using problematic samples found in deployment to retrain models. This raises an important question: can models learn to evade such monitors? To evaluate this capability, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to evade latent-space monitors while maintaining their blackbox behaviour. We apply RL-Obfuscation to Language Models ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate their Evasion Success Rate against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack while more holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, for these vulnerable monitors, models trained to evade a single static monitor can generalise to evade other unseen monitors. We also find that the models can be trained to conditionally bypass latent-space monitors on only certain inputs. Finally, we study how the models bypass these monitors and find that the model can learn to repurpose tokens to have different internal representations.

<title>SecP-Tuning: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Prompt Tuning for Large Language Models via MPC</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous fields, yet their adaptation to specialized tasks in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance remains constrained due to the scarcity of accessible training data caused by stringent privacy requirements. Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning provides theoretical guarantees for the privacy of model parameters and data. However, its application to LLMs has been predominantly limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant efficiency challenges, particularly in backward propagation, optimizer, and self-attention operations. To address these challenges, we propose SecP-Tuning, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving prompt tuning of LLMs. SecP-Tuning innovatively integrates Forward-only Tuning (FoT) through the ``data owner-server interaction" paradigm, effectively removing the need for privacy-preserving computations in backward propagation and optimization processes. Furthermore, it devises an efficient privacy-preserving Random Feature Attention (RFA), effectively mitigating the computational complexity of softmax-based self-attention and circumventing MPC-incompatible nonlinear operations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to full-Parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and gradient-based prompt tuning, SecP-Tuning achieves approximately 12 times and 16 times end-to-end acceleration, as well as 18 times and 20 times reductions in communication overhead, respectively. Moreover, in five few-shot tasks, it achieves an average performance score of 82.45, outperforming SFT's 79.90 and prompt tuning's 73.73. Additionally, the ``black-box/API-style" privacy-preserving tuning paradigm of SecP-Tuning effectively avoids memory leakage risks caused by gradient/parameter transmission.

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) use in-context learning (ICL) to solve a new task, they must infer latent concepts from demonstration examples. This raises the question of whether and how transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation. Our work experiments with several controlled tasks, studying this question using mechanistic interpretability. First, we show that in transitive reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model successfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept composition. This builds upon prior work that analyzes single-step reasoning. Then, we consider tasks parameterized by a latent numerical concept. We discover low-dimensional subspaces in the model's representation space, where the geometry cleanly reflects the underlying parameterization. Overall, we show that small and large models can indeed disentangle and utilize latent concepts that they learn in-context from a handful of abbreviated demonstrations.

Abstract: Online multi-agent control problems, where many agents pursue competing and time-varying objectives, are widespread in domains such as autonomous robotics, economics, and energy systems. In these settings, robustness to adversarial disturbances is critical. In this paper, we study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems subject to such disturbances. In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, which typically assumes noiseless or stochastically perturbed dynamics, we consider an online setting where disturbances can be adversarial, and where each agent seeks to minimize its own sequence of convex losses. Under two feedback models, we analyze online gradient-based controllers with local policy updates. We prove per-agent regret bounds that are sublinear and near-optimal in the time horizon and that highlight different scalings with the number of agents. When agents' objectives are aligned, we further show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying potential game for which we derive equilibrium tracking guarantees. Together, our results take a first step in bridging online control with online learning in games, establishing robust individual and collective performance guarantees in dynamic continuous-state environments.

<title>On the Necessity of Output Distribution Reweighting for Effective Class Unlearning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal a significant shortcoming in class unlearning evaluations: overlooking the underlying class geometry can cause privacy leakage. We further propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate this issue. We introduce a membership-inference attack via nearest neighbors (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities the model assigns to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples. Our experiments show that existing unlearning methods are vulnerable to MIA-NN across multiple datasets. We then propose a new fine-tuning objective that mitigates this privacy leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over the remaining classes that a retrained-from-scratch model would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting (TRW) distribution serves as the desired distribution during fine-tuning. We also show that across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior unlearning metrics. More specifically, on CIFAR-10, it reduces the gap with retrained models by 19% and 46% for U-LiRA and MIA-NN scores, accordingly, compared to the SOTA method for each category.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL), especially when clients differ not only in distribution but also in the reliability of their predictions across individual examples. While personalized FL (PFL) aims to address this, we observe that many PFL methods fail to outperform two necessary baselines, local training and centralized training. This suggests that meaningful personalization only emerges in a narrow regime, where global models are insufficient, but collaboration across clients still holds value. Our empirical findings point to two key ingredients for success in this regime: adaptivity in collaboration and fine-grained trust, at the level of individual examples. We show that these properties can be achieved within federated semi-supervised learning, where clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This enables each client to align with public consensus when it is helpful, and disregard it when it is not, without sharing model parameters or raw data. As a concrete realization of this idea, we develop FEDMOSAIC, a personalized co-training method where clients reweight their loss and their contribution to pseudo-labels based on per-example agreement and confidence. FEDMOSAIC outperforms strong FL and PFL baselines across a range of non-IID settings, and we prove convergence under standard smoothness, bounded-variance, and drift assumptions. In contrast to many of these baselines, it also outperforms local and centralized training. These results clarify when federated personalization can be effective, and how fine-grained, trust-aware collaboration enables it.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

<title>Lightweight MSA Design Advances Protein Folding From Evolutionary Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Protein structure prediction often hinges on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which underperform on low-homology and orphan proteins. We introduce PLAME, a lightweight MSA design framework that leverages evolutionary embeddings from pretrained protein language models to generate MSAs that better support downstream folding. PLAME couples these embeddings with a conservation--diversity loss that balances agreement on conserved positions with coverage of plausible sequence variation. Beyond generation, we develop (i) an MSA selection strategy to filter high-quality candidates and (ii) a sequence-quality metric that is complementary to depth-based measures and predictive of folding gains. On AlphaFold2 low-homology/orphan benchmarks, PLAME delivers state-of-the-art improvements in structure accuracy (e.g., lDDT/TM-score), with consistent gains when paired with AlphaFold3. Ablations isolate the benefits of the selection strategy, and case studies elucidate how MSA characteristics shape AlphaFold confidence and error modes. Finally, we show PLAME functions as a lightweight adapter, enabling ESMFold to approach AlphaFold2-level accuracy while retaining ESMFold-like inference speed. PLAME thus provides a practical path to high-quality folding for proteins lacking strong evolutionary neighbors.

Abstract: Score-function based methods for policy learning, such as REINFORCE and PPO, have delivered strong results in game-playing and robotics, yet their high variance often undermines training stability. Using pathwise policy gradients, i.e. computing a derivative by differentiating the objective function, alleviates the variance issues. However, they require an accurate action-conditioned value function, which is notoriously hard to learn without relying on replay buffers for reusing past off-policy data. We present an on-policy algorithm that trains Q-value models purely from on-policy trajectories, unlocking the possibility of using pathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to combine stochastic policies for exploration with constrained updates for stable training, and evaluate important architectural components that stabilize value function learning. The result, Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), is an efficient on-policy algorithm that combines the stability of pathwise policy gradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard on-policy learning. Compared to state-of-the-art on two standard GPU-parallelized benchmarks, REPPO provides strong empirical performance at superior sample efficiency, wall-clock time, memory footprint, and hyperparameter robustness.

<title>The Invisible Leash: Why RLVR May or May Not Escape Its Origin</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs highlight RLVR as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the current practice of RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or mainly amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents an empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of the common practice of RLVR. We examine how, under current training conditions, RLVR can operate as a support-constrained optimization mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions, remaining constrained by the base model's initial distribution. We also identify an entropy-reward trade-off: while the current RLVR recipe reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while the current RLVR recipe consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy - resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step - answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of the current RLVR recipe in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models (LLMs) but incurs substantial inference cost due to long autoregressive trajectories. Existing acceleration strategies either shorten traces via early stopping or compression, or adopt speculative decoding with a smaller model. However, speculative decoding provides limited gains when model agreement is low and rigidly enforces token-level consistency, overlooking the observation that some smaller models, when correct, produce significantly more concise reasoning traces that could reduce inference length. We introduce R-Stitch, a training-free hybrid decoding framework that leverages token-level entropy as an uncertainty proxy to delegate computation between a small language model (SLM) and an LLM. Our analysis shows that high-entropy tokens are more likely to induce errors, motivating an entropy-guided routing strategy that lets the SLM efficiently handle low-entropy tokens while delegating uncertain ones to the LLM, thereby avoiding full rollbacks and preserving answer quality. We further extend this design with R-Stitch$^{+}$, which learns an adaptive routing policy to adjust the token budget dynamically beyond fixed thresholds. By jointly reducing per-token decoding complexity and the number of generated tokens, our method achieves substantial acceleration with negligible accuracy loss. Concretely, it attains peak speedups of 3.00$\times$ on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, 3.85$\times$ on 14B, and 4.10$\times$ on QWQ-32B while maintaining accuracy comparable to full LLM decoding. Moreover, it naturally enables adaptive efficiency--accuracy trade-offs that can be tailored to diverse computational budgets without retraining.

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd dynamics constitutes an important open challenge for systematic numerical analysis, optimization and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms for learning surrogate models of high-dim. multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dim. space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dim. space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. With this "embed->learn in latent space->lift back to ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use SFM to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus allowing for fast and accurate modelling of crowd dynamics from agent-based simulations. Notably, linear MVAR models surpass nonlinear LSTMs in predictive accuracy, while also offering significantly lower complexity and greater interpretability.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has recently emerged as a promising approach for learning discrete representations of graph-structured data. However, a fundamental challenge, i.e., codebook collapse, remains underexplored in the graph domain, significantly limiting the expressiveness and generalization of graph tokens.In this paper, we present the first empirical study showing that codebook collapse consistently occurs when applying VQ to graph data, even with mitigation strategies proposed in vision or language domains. To understand why graph VQ is particularly vulnerable to collapse, we provide a theoretical analysis and identify two key factors: early assignment imbalances caused by redundancy in graph features and structural patterns, and self-reinforcing optimization loops in deterministic VQ. To address these issues, we propose RGVQ, a novel framework that integrates graph topology and feature similarity as explicit regularization signals to enhance codebook utilization and promote token diversity. RGVQ introduces soft assignments via Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, ensuring that all codewords receive gradient updates. In addition, RGVQ incorporates a structure-aware contrastive regularization to penalize the token co-assignments among dissimilar node pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RGVQ substantially improves codebook utilization and consistently boosts the performance of state-of-the-art graph VQ backbones across multiple downstream tasks, enabling more expressive and transferable graph token representations.

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this, current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (ERIS) framework to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial generalization mechanism enhances robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that ERIS achieves a statistically significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, consistently securing the top performance rank.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy sources such as solar panels and battery storage poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The energy injected from the BTM sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decrease in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification. Using a Transformer-based architecture that integrates sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies, DualNILM effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. Extensive evaluation on self-collected and synthesized datasets demonstrates that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods. Our work underscores the framework's potential for robust energy disaggregation in modern energy systems with renewable penetration. Synthetic photovoltaic augmented datasets with realistic injection simulation methodology will be open-sourced after review.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual inspection of EEG characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error. Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively developed, they continue to face challenges arising from the non-stationarity and variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals across diverse clinical configurations, often resulting in poor generalization. In this work, we propose SleepDIFFormer, a multi-channel differential transformer framework for heterogeneous EEG-EOG representation learning. SleepDIFFormer is trained across multiple sleep staging datasets, each treated as a source domain, with the goal of generalizing to unseen target domains. Specifically, it employs a Multi-channel Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) designed to process raw EEG and EOG signals while incorporating cross-domain alignment. Our approach mitigates spatial and temporal attention noise and learns a domain-invariant EEG-EOG representation through feature distribution alignment across datasets, thereby enhancing generalization to new domains. Empirically, we evaluated SleepDIFFormer on five diverse sleep staging datasets under domain generalization settings and benchmarked it against existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We further conducted a comprehensive ablation study and interpreted the differential attention weights, demonstrating their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns. These findings advance the development of automated sleep stage classification and highlight its potential in quantifying sleep architecture and detecting abnormalities that disrupt restorative rest. Our source code and checkpoint are made publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to interpretable concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many SAE features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value aside from its effect on reconstruction. In this work we study the effect of L0 on SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set correctly, the SAE fails to disentangle the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we present a proxy metric that can help guide the search for the correct L0 for an SAE on a given training distribution. We show that our method finds the correct L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLM SAEs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that L0 must be set correctly to train SAEs with correct features.

<title>In-Context Algorithm Emulation in Fixed-Weight Transformers</title>

Abstract: We prove that a minimal Transformer with frozen weights emulates a broad class of algorithms by in-context prompting. We formalize two modes of in-context algorithm emulation. In the task-specific mode, for any continuous function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, we show the existence of a single-head softmax attention layer whose forward pass reproduces functions of the form $f(w^\top x - y)$ to arbitrary precision. This general template subsumes many popular machine learning algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, linear regression, ridge regression). In the prompt-programmable mode, we prove universality: a single fixed-weight two-layer softmax attention module emulates all algorithms from the task-specific class (i.e., each implementable by a single softmax attention) via only prompting. Our key idea is to construct prompts that encode an algorithm's parameters into token representations, creating sharp dot-product gaps that force the softmax attention to follow the intended computation. This construction requires no feed-forward layers and no parameter updates. All adaptation happens through the prompt alone. Numerical results corroborate our theory. These findings forge a direct link between in-context learning and algorithmic emulation, and offer a simple mechanism for large Transformers to serve as prompt-programmable libraries of algorithms. They illuminate how GPT-style foundation models may swap algorithms via prompts alone, and establish a form of algorithmic universality in modern Transformer models.

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to enable effective decision-making over long timescales. Existing approaches, while promising, have yet to realize the benefits of large-scale training. In this work, we identify and solve several key challenges in scaling online hierarchical RL to high-throughput environments. We propose Scalable Option Learning (SOL), a highly scalable hierarchical RL algorithm which achieves a ~35x higher throughput compared to existing hierarchical methods. To demonstrate SOL's performance and scalability, we train hierarchical agents using 30 billion frames of experience on the complex game of NetHack, significantly surpassing flat agents and demonstrating positive scaling trends. We also validate SOL on MiniHack and Mujoco environments, showcasing its general applicability. Our code is open sourced at: github.com/facebookresearch/sol.

<title>Challenges in Non-Polymeric Crystal Structure Prediction: Why a Geometric, Permutation-Invariant Loss is Needed</title>

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction is an essential prerequisite for designing materials with targeted properties. Yet, it is still an open challenge in materials design and drug discovery. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting three-dimensional non-polymeric crystal structures remains elusive. In this work, we focus on the molecular assembly problem, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Such a simplified formulation provides a useful approximation to the actual problem. However, while recent state-of-the-art methods have increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques, the underlying learning objective remains ill-posed. We propose a better formulation that introduces a loss function capturing key geometric molecular properties while ensuring permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. Remarkably, we demonstrate that within this framework, a simple regression model already outperforms prior approaches, including flow matching techniques, on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated non-polymeric subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions) Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant, we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for technical progress.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing through a ``train once, deploy anywhere'' paradigm, where a single pre-trained model adapts to countless downstream tasks without retraining. Access to a Physics Foundation Model (PFM) would be transformative -- democratizing access to high-fidelity simulations, accelerating scientific discovery, and eliminating the need for specialized solver development. Yet current physics-aware machine learning approaches remain fundamentally limited to single, narrow domains and require retraining for each new system. We present the General Physics Transformer (GPhyT), trained on 1.8 TB of diverse simulation data, that demonstrates foundation model capabilities are achievable for physics. Our key insight is that transformers can learn to infer governing dynamics from context, enabling a single model to simulate fluid-solid interactions, shock waves, thermal convection, and multi-phase dynamics without being told the underlying equations. GPhyT achieves three critical breakthroughs: (1) superior performance across multiple physics domains, outperforming specialized architectures by up to 29x, (2) zero-shot generalization to entirely unseen physical systems through in-context learning, and (3) stable long-term predictions through 50-timestep rollouts. By establishing that a single model can learn generalizable physical principles from data alone, this work opens the path toward a universal PFM that could transform computational science and engineering.

<title>A Variational Framework for Residual-Based Adaptivity in Neural PDE Solvers and Operator Learning</title>

Abstract: Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error, while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning, we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled discretization and training strategies.

Abstract: Large deep learning models such as BERT and ResNet achieve state-of-the-art performance but are costly to deploy at the edge due to their size and compute demands. We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size. Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption. These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems, supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud, vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from -40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally, heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase. These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors, high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically, ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based on real-time GPU temperature.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in Optimization, Game Theory, and the training of Generative Adversarial Networks, the convergence properties of first order methods in min-max problems have received extensive study. It has been recognized that they may cycle, and there is no good understanding of their limit points when they do not. When they converge, do they converge to local min-max solutions? We characterize the limit points of two basic first order methods, namely Gradient Descent/Ascent (GDA) and Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (OGDA). We show that both dynamics avoid unstable critical points for almost all initializations. Moreover, for small step sizes and under mild assumptions, the set of \{OGDA\}-stable critical points is a superset of \{GDA\}-stable critical points, which is a superset of local min-max solutions (strict in some cases). The connecting thread is that the behavior of these dynamics can be studied from a dynamical systems perspective.

Abstract: Radiologists interpret mammography exams by jointly analyzing all four views, as correlations among them are crucial for accurate diagnosis. Recent methods employ dedicated fusion blocks to capture such dependencies, but these are often hindered by view dominance, training instability, and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce multi-view hypercomplex learning, a novel learning paradigm for multi-view breast cancer classification based on parameterized hypercomplex neural networks (PHNNs). Thanks to hypercomplex algebra, our models intrinsically capture both intra- and inter-view relations. We propose PHResNets for two-view exams and two complementary four-view architectures: PHYBOnet, optimized for efficiency, and PHYSEnet, optimized for accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view models, while also generalizing across radiographic modalities and tasks such as disease classification from chest X-rays and multimodal brain tumor segmentation. Full code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ispamm/PHBreast.

Abstract: Binary code analysis and comprehension is critical to applications in reverse engineering and computer security tasks where source code is not available. Unfortunately, unlike source code, binary code lacks semantics and is more difficult for human engineers to understand and analyze. In this paper, we present ContraBin, a contrastive learning technique that integrates source code and comment information along with binaries to create an embedding capable of aiding binary analysis and comprehension tasks. Specifically, we present three components in ContraBin: (1) a primary contrastive learning method for initial pre-training, (2) a simplex interpolation method to integrate source code, comments, and binary code, and (3) an intermediate representation learning algorithm to train a binary code embedding. We further analyze the impact of human-written and synthetic comments on binary code comprehension tasks, revealing a significant performance disparity. While synthetic comments provide substantial benefits, human-written comments are found to introduce noise, even resulting in performance drops compared to using no comments. These findings reshape the narrative around the role of comment types in binary code analysis. We evaluate the effectiveness of ContraBin through four indicative downstream tasks related to binary code: algorithmic functionality classification, function name recovery, code summarization, and reverse engineering. The results show that ContraBin considerably improves performance on all four tasks, measured by accuracy, mean of average precision, and BLEU scores as appropriate. ContraBin is the first language representation model to incorporate source code, binary code, and comments into contrastive code representation learning and is intended to contribute to the field of binary code analysis. The dataset used in this study is available for further research.

Abstract: Focusing on stochastic programming (SP) with covariate information, this paper proposes an empirical risk minimization (ERM) method embedded within a nonconvex piecewise affine decision rule (PADR), which aims to learn the direct mapping from features to optimal decisions. We establish the nonasymptotic consistency result of our PADR-based ERM model for unconstrained problems and asymptotic consistency result for constrained ones. To solve the nonconvex and nondifferentiable ERM problem, we develop an enhanced stochastic majorization-minimization algorithm and establish the asymptotic convergence to (composite strong) directional stationarity along with complexity analysis. We show that the proposed PADR-based ERM method applies to a broad class of nonconvex SP problems with theoretical consistency guarantees and computational tractability. Our numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of PADR-based ERM methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches under various settings, with significantly lower costs, less computation time, and robustness to feature dimensions and nonlinearity of the underlying dependency.

Abstract: In the realm of mobile edge computing (MEC), efficient computation task offloading plays a pivotal role in ensuring a seamless quality of experience (QoE) for users. Maintaining a high QoE is paramount in today's interconnected world, where users demand reliable services. This challenge stands as one of the most primary key factors contributing to handling dynamic and uncertain mobile environments. In this study, we delve into computation offloading in MEC systems, where strict task processing deadlines and energy constraints can adversely affect the system performance. We formulate the computation task offloading problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) to maximize the long-term QoE of each user individually. We propose a distributed QoE-oriented computation offloading (QECO) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that empowers mobile devices to make their offloading decisions without requiring knowledge of decisions made by other devices. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the performance of QECO. Simulation results reveal that compared to the state-of-the-art existing works, QECO increases the number of completed tasks by up to 14.4%, while simultaneously reducing task delay and energy consumption by 9.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Together, these improvements result in a significant average QoE enhancement of 37.1%. This substantial improvement is achieved by accurately accounting for user dynamics and edge server workloads when making intelligent offloading decisions. This highlights QECO's effectiveness in enhancing users' experience in MEC systems.

arXiv:2312.04692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models, while achieving remarkable performances, are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Although various defenses have been proposed, there is still substantial room for improvement in the privacy-utility trade-off. In this work, we introduce a novel defense framework against MIAs by leveraging generative models. The key intuition of our defense is to remove the differences between member and non-member inputs, which is exploited by MIAs, by re-generating input samples before feeding them to the target model. Therefore, our defense, called DIFFENCE, works pre inference, which is unlike prior defenses that are either training-time or post-inference time.
  A unique feature of DIFFENCE is that it works on input samples only, without modifying the training or inference phase of the target model. Therefore, it can be cascaded with other defense mechanisms as we demonstrate through experiments. DIFFENCE is designed to preserve the model's prediction labels for each sample, thereby not affecting accuracy. Furthermore, we have empirically demonstrated it does not reduce the usefulness of confidence vectors. Through extensive experimentation, we show that DIFFENCE can serve as a robust plug-n-play defense mechanism, enhancing membership privacy without compromising model utility. For instance, DIFFENCE reduces MIA accuracy against an undefended model by 15.8\% and attack AUC by 14.0\% on average across three datasets, all without impacting model utility. By integrating DIFFENCE with prior defenses, we can achieve new state-of-the-art performances in the privacy-utility trade-off. For example, when combined with the state-of-the-art SELENA defense it reduces attack accuracy by 9.3\%, and attack AUC by 10.0\%. DIFFENCE achieves this by imposing a negligible computation overhead, adding only 57ms to the inference time per sample processed on average.

Abstract: With the emergence of new storage and communication methods, the insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) channel has attracted considerable attention. However, many topics on the IDS channel and the associated Levenshtein distance remain open, making the invention of a novel IDS-correcting code a hard task. Furthermore, current studies on single-IDS-correcting code misalign with the requirements of applications which necessitates the correcting of multiple errors. Compromise solutions have involved shortening codewords to reduce the chance of multiple errors. However, the code rates of existing codes are poor at short lengths, diminishing the overall storage density. In this study, a novel method is introduced for designing high-code-rate single-IDS-correcting codewords through deep Levenshtein distance embedding. A deep learning model is utilized to project the sequences into embedding vectors that preserve the Levenshtein distances between the original sequences. This embedding space serves as a proxy for the complex Levenshtein domain, within which algorithms for codeword search and segment correcting is developed. While the concept underpinning this approach is straightforward, it bypasses the mathematical challenges typically encountered in code design. The proposed method results in a code rate that outperforms existing combinatorial solutions, particularly for designing short-length codewords.

Abstract: We consider the problem of online resource allocation with average budget constraints. At each time point the decision maker makes an irrevocable decision of whether to accept or reject a request before the next request arrives with the goal to maximize the cumulative rewards. In contrast to existing literature requiring the total resource consumption is below a certain level, we require the average resource consumption per accepted request does not exceed a given threshold. This problem can be casted as an online knapsack problem with exogenous random budget replenishment, and can find applications in various fields such as online anomaly detection, sequential advertising, and per-capita public service providers. We start with general arrival distributions and show that a simple policy achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such a regret growing rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over accept arrivals, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget safety buffers. It turns out that a little more safety can greatly enhance efficiency -- small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. From a practical perspective, we extend the policy to the scenario with continuous arrival distributions, time-dependent information structures, as well as unknown $T$. We conduct both synthetic experiments and empirical applications on a time series data of New York City taxi passengers to validate the performance of our proposed policies.

Abstract: Operator learning is a variant of machine learning that is designed to approximate maps between function spaces from data. The Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is one of the main model architectures used for operator learning. The FNO combines linear and nonlinear operations in physical space with linear operations in Fourier space, leading to a parameterized map acting between function spaces. Although in definition, FNOs are objects in continuous space and perform convolutions on a continuum, their implementation is a discretized object performing computations on a grid, allowing efficient implementation via the FFT. Thus, there is a discretization error between the continuum FNO definition and the discretized object used in practice that is separate from other previously analyzed sources of model error. We examine this discretization error here and obtain algebraic rates of convergence in terms of the grid resolution as a function of the input regularity. Numerical experiments that validate the theory and describe model stability are performed. In addition, an algorithm is presented that leverages the discretization error and model error decomposition to optimize computational training time.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Different from conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Therefore, simplistic binary AD classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class heterogeneity and instance-level imbalance. In this work, we found using a sample score estimator can generate sample-specific soft scores aligning with cognitive scores. We subsequently propose two simple yet effective methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Based on the ADReSS and CU-MARVEL corpora, we demonstrated and analyzed the advantages of the proposed approaches in detection performance. These findings provide insights for developing robust and reliable AD detection models.

<title>Leveraging Model Guidance to Extract Training Data from Personalized Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have become powerful image generation tools, especially for few-shot fine-tuning where a pretrained DM is fine-tuned on a small image set to capture specific styles or objects. Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases. The code is available https://github.com/Nicholas0228/FineXtract.

<title>A Survey on LLM-based Code Generation for Low-Resource and Domain-Specific Programming Languages</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in code generation for popular programming languages. However, their performance on Low-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) remains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million users in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs encounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized syntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets.
  Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development efficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science. While several surveys discuss LLMs in software engineering, none focus specifically on the challenges and opportunities associated with LRPLs and DSLs. Our survey fills this gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We filtered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs. We report the LLMs used, benchmarks, and metrics for evaluation, strategies for enhancing performance, and methods for dataset collection and curation.
  We identified four main evaluation techniques and several metrics for assessing code generation in LRPLs and DSLs. Our analysis categorizes improvement methods into six groups and summarizes novel architectures proposed by researchers. Despite various techniques and metrics, a standard approach and benchmark dataset for evaluating code generation in LRPLs and DSLs are lacking. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of LLMs, software engineering, and specialized programming languages, laying the groundwork for future advancements in code generation for LRPLs and DSLs.

<title>Stuffed Mamba: Oversized States Lead to the Inability to Forget</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07145</link>

Abstract: Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have showcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.

Abstract: Testing and validating Autonomous Vehicle (AV) performance in safety-critical and diverse scenarios is crucial before real-world deployment. However, manually creating such scenarios in simulation remains a significant and time-consuming challenge. This work introduces a novel method that generates dynamic temporal scene graphs corresponding to diverse traffic scenarios, on-demand, tailored to user-defined preferences, such as AV actions, sets of dynamic agents, and criticality levels. A temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) model learns to predict relationships between ego-vehicle, agents, and static structures, guided by real-world spatiotemporal interaction patterns and constrained by an ontology that restricts predictions to semantically valid links. Our model consistently outperforms the baselines in accurately generating links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We render the predicted scenarios in simulation to further demonstrate their effectiveness as testing environments for AV agents.

<title>$100K or 100 Days: Trade-offs when Pre-Training with Academic Resources</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23261</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2410.23261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-training is notoriously compute-intensive and academic researchers are notoriously under-resourced. It is, therefore, commonly assumed that academics can't pre-train models. In this paper, we seek to clarify this assumption. We first survey academic researchers to learn about their available compute and then empirically measure the time to replicate models on such resources. We introduce a benchmark to measure the time to pre-train models on given GPUs and also identify ideal settings for maximizing training speed. We run our benchmark on a range of models and academic GPUs, spending 2,000 GPU-hours on our experiments. Our results reveal a brighter picture for academic pre-training: for example, although Pythia-1B was originally trained on 64 GPUs for 3 days, we find it is also possible to replicate this model (with the same hyper-parameters) in 3x fewer GPU-days: i.e. on 4 GPUs in 18 days. We conclude with a cost-benefit analysis to help clarify the trade-offs between price and pre-training time. We believe our benchmark will help academic researchers conduct experiments that require training larger models on more data. We fully release our codebase at: https://github.com/apoorvkh/academic-pretraining.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of new chemical compounds is essential for advancing global health and developing treatments. While generative models show promise in creating novel molecules, challenges remain in ensuring the real-world applicability of these molecules and finding such molecules efficiently. To address this challenge, we introduce Conditional Latent Space Molecular Scaffold Optimization (CLaSMO), which integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) with Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (LSBO) to strategically modify molecules while preserving similarity to the original input, effectively framing the task as constrained optimization. Our LSBO setting improves the sample-efficiency of the molecular optimization, and our modification approach helps us to obtain molecules with higher chances of real-world applicability. CLaSMO explores substructures of molecules in a sample-efficient manner by performing BO in the latent space of a CVAE conditioned on the atomic environment of the molecule to be optimized. Our extensive evaluations across diverse optimization tasks, including rediscovery, docking score, and multi-property optimization, show that CLaSMO efficiently enhances target properties, delivers remarkable sample-efficiency crucial for resource-limited applications while considering molecular similarity constraints, achieves state of the art performance, and maintains practical synthetic accessibility. We also provide an open-source web application that enables chemical experts to apply CLaSMO in a Human-in-the-Loop setting.

arXiv:2411.07102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address unconstrained finite-sum optimization problems, with particular focus on instances originating in large scale deep learning scenarios. Our main interest lies in the exploration of the relationship between recent line search approaches for stochastic optimization in the overparametrized regime and momentum directions. First, we point out that combining these two elements with computational benefits is not straightforward. To this aim, we propose a solution based on mini-batch persistency. We then introduce an algorithmic framework that exploits a mix of data persistency, conjugate-gradient type rules for the definition of the momentum parameter and stochastic line searches. The resulting algorithm provably possesses convergence properties under suitable assumptions and is empirically shown to outperform other popular methods from the literature, obtaining state-of-the-art results in both convex and nonconvex large scale training problems.

Abstract: Estimating the uncertainty of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge. While recent Bayesian methods have demonstrated effectiveness in quantifying uncertainty through low-rank weight updates, they typically require complex fine-tuning or post-training procedures. In this paper, we propose Training-Free Bayesianization (TFB), a simple yet theoretically grounded framework that efficiently transforms trained low-rank adapters into Bayesian ones without additional training. TFB systematically searches for the maximally acceptable level of variance in the weight posterior, constrained within a family of low-rank isotropic Gaussian distributions. Our theoretical analysis shows that under mild conditions, this search process is equivalent to KL-regularized variational optimization, a generalized form of variational inference. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that TFB achieves superior uncertainty estimation and generalization compared to existing methods while eliminating the need for complex Bayesianization training procedures. Code will be available at https://github.com/Wang-ML-Lab/bayesian-peft.

Abstract: Domain-adaptive post-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach for specialized domains such as medicine and finance. However, significant challenges remain in identifying optimal adaptation criteria and training strategies across varying data and model configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce FINDAP, a systematic and fine-grained investigation into domain-adaptive post-training of LLMs for the finance domain. Our approach consists of four key components: FinCap, which defines the core capabilities required for the target domain; FinRec, an effective training recipe that jointly optimizes continual pre-training and instruction-following, along with a novel preference data distillation method leveraging process signals from a generative reward model; FinTrain, a curated set of training datasets supporting FinRec; and FinEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with FinCap. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks. Our analysis also highlights how each post-training stage contributes to distinct capabilities, uncovering specific challenges and effective solutions, providing valuable insights for domain adaptation of LLMs

<title>IP$^{2}$-RSNN: Bi-level Intrinsic Plasticity Enables Learning-to-learn in Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2501.14539v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-to-learn (L2L), defined as progressively faster learning across similar tasks, is fundamental to both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, its neural basis remains elusive, as most studies emphasize neural population dynamics induced by synaptic plasticity while overlooking adaptations driven by intrinsic neuronal plasticity, which point-neuron models cannot capture. To address the above issue, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network with bi-level intrinsic plasticity (IP$^{2}$-RSNN). First, based on task demands, a slow meta-intrinsic plasticity determines which intrinsic neuronal properties are learnable, which is preserved throughout subsequent task learning once configured. Second, a fast intrinsic plasticity fine-tunes those learnable properties within each task. Our results indicate that the proposed bi-level intrinsic plasticity plays a critical role in enabling L2L in RSNNs and show that IP$^{2}$-RSNNs outperform point-neuron recurrent neural networks and self-attention models. Furthermore, our analysis of multi-scale neural dynamics reveals that the bi-level intrinsic plasticity is essential to task-type-specific adaptations at both the neuronal and network levels during L2L, while such adaptations cannot be captured by point-neuron models. Our results suggest that intrinsic plasticity provides significant computational advantages in L2L, shedding light on the design of brain-inspired deep learning models and algorithms.

Abstract: Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of the large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown. Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development in quality and transfer value of professional football players. The predictive accuracy is studied by training the models to predict the quality and value of players one year ahead. This is carried out by training them on two data sets containing data-driven indicators describing the player quality and player value in historical settings. In general, the random forest model is found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, this research shows that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. The resulting models can help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.

Abstract: Controllable image-to-video (I2V) generation transforms a reference image into a coherent video guided by user-specified control signals. In content creation workflows, precise and simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction enhances both accuracy and flexibility. However, existing approaches typically treat these control signals separately, largely due to the scarcity of datasets with high-quality joint annotations and mismatched control spaces across modalities. We present VidCRAFT3, a unified and flexible I2V framework that supports both independent and joint control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction by integrating three core components. Image2Cloud reconstructs a 3D point cloud from the reference image to enable precise camera motion control. ObjMotionNet encodes sparse object trajectories into multi-scale optical flow features to guide object motion. The Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer integrates lighting direction embeddings via parallel cross-attention. To address the scarcity of jointly annotated data, we curate the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset of synthetic static-scene video clips with per-frame lighting-direction labels, and adopt a three-stage training strategy that enables robust learning without fully joint annotations. Extensive experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms existing methods in control precision and visual coherence. Code and data will be released.

Abstract: Language model evaluations often fail to characterize consequential failure modes, forcing experts to inspect outputs and build new benchmarks. We introduce task elicitation, a method that automatically builds new evaluations to profile model behavior. Task elicitation finds hundreds of natural-language tasks -- an order of magnitude more than prior work -- where frontier models exhibit systematic failures, in domains ranging from forecasting to online harassment. For example, we find that Sonnet 3.5 over-associates quantum computing and AGI and that o3-mini is prone to hallucination when fabrications are repeated in-context.

Abstract: Realistic and interactive surgical simulation has the potential to facilitate crucial applications, such as medical professional training and autonomous surgical agent training. In the natural visual domain, world models have enabled action-controlled data generation, demonstrating the potential to train autonomous agents in interactive simulated environments when large-scale real data acquisition is infeasible. However, such works in the surgical domain have been limited to simplified computer simulations, and lack realism. Furthermore, existing literature in world models has predominantly dealt with action-labeled data, limiting their applicability to real-world surgical data, where obtaining action annotation is prohibitively expensive. Inspired by the recent success of Genie in leveraging unlabeled video game data to infer latent actions and enable action-controlled data generation, we propose the first surgical vision world model. The proposed model can generate action-controllable surgical data and the architecture design is verified with extensive experiments on the unlabeled SurgToolLoc-2022 dataset.

Abstract: Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) is a widely adopted strategy for reducing the computational cost of attention layers in large language models (LLMs). However, current GQA configurations are often suboptimal because they overlook how context length influences inference cost. Since inference cost grows with context length, the most cost-efficient GQA configuration should also vary accordingly. In this work, we analyze the relationship among context length, model size, GQA configuration, and model loss, and introduce two innovations: (1) we decouple the total head size from the hidden size, enabling more flexible control over attention FLOPs; and (2) we jointly optimize the model size and the GQA configuration to arrive at a better allocation of inference resources between attention layers and other components. Our analysis reveals that commonly used GQA configurations are highly suboptimal for long-context scenarios. More importantly, we propose a recipe for deriving cost-optimal GQA configurations. Our results show that for long-context scenarios, one should use fewer attention heads while scaling up model size. Configurations selected by our recipe can reduce both memory usage and FLOPs by more than 50% compared to Llama-3's GQA, with *no degradation in model capabilities*. Our findings offer valuable insights for designing efficient long-context LLMs. The code is available at https://www.github.com/THUNLP/cost-optimal-gqa .

Abstract: Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of personalized driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving styles. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.

Abstract: In real-world applications, it is highly challenging to detect anomalous samples with extremely sparse anomalies, as they are highly similar to and thus easily confused with normal samples. Moreover, the number of anomalous samples is inherently scarce. This results in a dual imbalance Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) problem, manifesting at both the macro and micro levels. To address this "needle-in-a-haystack problem", we find that MIL problem can be reformulated as a fine-grained PU learning problem. This allows us to address the imbalance issue in an unbiased manner using micro-level balancing mechanisms. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU)-based on rigorous theoretical foundations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BFGPU.

Abstract: As large language models increasingly rely on external data sources, compensating data contributors has become a central concern. But how should these payments be devised? We revisit data valuations from a $\textit{market-design perspective}$ where payments serve to compensate data owners for the $\textit{private}$ heterogeneous costs they incur for collecting and sharing data. We show that popular valuation methods-such as Leave-One-Out and Data Shapley-make for poor payments. They fail to ensure truthful reporting of the costs, leading to $\textit{inefficient market}$ outcomes. To address this, we adapt well-established payment rules from mechanism design, namely Myerson and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG), to the data market setting. We show that Myerson payment is the minimal truthful mechanism, optimal from the buyer's perspective. Additionally, we identify a condition under which both data buyers and sellers are utility-satisfied, and the market achieves efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating incentive compatibility into data valuation design, paving the way for more robust and efficient data markets. Our data market framework is readily applicable to real-world scenarios. We illustrate this with simulations of contributor compensation in an LLM based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) marketplace tasked with challenging medical question answering.

Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to the future of humanity, and its impacts are being intensified by excess man-made greenhouse gas emissions. One method governments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with emission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess emissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing and capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be submitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they can be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent Nash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an NP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique Nash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate not only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to climate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings emitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through numerical experiments.

<title>Can Code Language Models Learn Clarification-Seeking Behaviors?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, a gap remains between their output and the problem-solving strategies of human developers. Unlike humans, who spend substantial time disambiguating requirements through iterative dialogue, LLMs often generate code despite ambiguities in natural language requirements, leading to unreliable solutions. Different from prior work, we study whether a Code LLM can be fine-tuned to learn clarification-seeking behavior. While recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code generation, we argue that the ability to recognize and query ambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves, especially in agentic AI where models and humans collaborate. We present ClarifyCoder, a framework with synthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that fine-tunes an LLM to identify ambiguities and request clarification before code generation. Our approach has two components: (1) a data synthesis technique that augments programming datasets with scenarios requiring clarification to generate clarification-aware training data, and (2) a fine-tuning strategy that teaches models to prioritize seeking clarification over immediate code generation when faced with incomplete or ambiguous requirements. We also provide an empirical analysis of integrating ClarifyCoder with standard fine-tuning for joint optimization of clarification-awareness and coding ability. Experimental results show that ClarifyCoder achieves a 63% communication rate (40% absolute increase) and a 52% good question rate (30% absolute increase) on ambiguous tasks, significantly improving LLMs' communication capabilities while maintaining code generation performance.

<title>CARL: Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning for Spectral Image Analysis</title>

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce CARL, a model for Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic representation, we introduce a novel spectral encoder, featuring a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism, to distill salient spectral information into learned spectral representations. Spatio-spectral pre-training is achieved with a novel feature-based self-supervision strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

Abstract: Solving non-convex resource allocation problems poses significant challenges in wireless communication systems, often beyond the capability of traditional optimization techniques. To address this issue, we propose LLM-OptiRA, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and transform non-convex components into solvable forms, enabling fully automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless communication systems. LLM-OptiRA not only simplifies problem-solving by reducing reliance on expert knowledge, but also integrates error correction and feasibility validation mechanisms to ensure robustness. Experimental results show that LLM-OptiRA achieves an execution rate of 96% and a success rate of 80% on GPT-4, significantly outperforming baseline approaches in complex optimization tasks across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Language is a powerful communicative and cognitive tool. It enables humans to express thoughts, share intentions, and reason about complex phenomena. Despite our fluency in using and understanding language, the question of how it arises and evolves over time remains unsolved. A leading hypothesis in linguistics and anthropology posits that language evolved to meet the ecological and social demands of early human cooperation. Language did not arise in isolation, but through shared survival goals. Inspired by this view, we investigate the emergence of language in multi-agent Foraging Games. These environments are designed to reflect the cognitive and ecological constraints believed to have influenced the evolution of communication. Agents operate in a shared grid world with only partial knowledge about other agents and the environment, and must coordinate to complete games like picking up high-value targets or executing temporally ordered actions. Using end-to-end deep reinforcement learning, agents learn both actions and communication strategies from scratch. We find that agents develop communication protocols with hallmark features of natural language: arbitrariness, interchangeability, displacement, cultural transmission, and compositionality. We quantify each property and analyze how different factors, such as population size, social dynamics, and temporal dependencies, shape specific aspects of the emergent language. Our framework serves as a platform for studying how language can evolve from partial observability, temporal reasoning, and cooperative goals in embodied multi-agent settings. We will release all data, code, and models publicly.

<title>UltraEdit: Training-, Subject-, and Memory-Free Lifelong Editing in Language Models</title>

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose UltraEdit, a training-, subject-, and memory-free approach that is well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing. UltraEdit fundamentally differs from traditional paradigms by computing parameter shifts in one step using only a hidden state and its gradient, making the approach simple yet efficient. To improve scalability in lifelong settings, UltraEdit employs a lifelong normalization strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. UltraEdit achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art method, which was also the fastest known approach, while using less than 1/4 the VRAM. This makes it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a 24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct UltraEditBench, the largest dataset in the field to date with over 2M editing pairs, and demonstrate that our method supports up to 2M edits while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets and six models show that UltraEdit consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing scenarios, taking a further step towards safe and scalable lifelong learning.

<title>Octic Vision Transformers: Quicker ViTs Through Equivariance</title>

Abstract: Why are state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) not designed to exploit natural geometric symmetries such as 90-degree rotations and reflections? In this paper, we argue that there is no fundamental reason, and what has been missing is an efficient implementation. To this end, we introduce Octic Vision Transformers (octic ViTs) which rely on octic group equivariance to capture these symmetries. In contrast to prior equivariant models that increase computational cost, our octic linear layers achieve 5.33x reductions in FLOPs and up to 8x reductions in memory compared to ordinary linear layers. In full octic ViT blocks the computational reductions approach the reductions in the linear layers with increased embedding dimension. We study two new families of ViTs, built from octic blocks, that are either fully octic equivariant or break equivariance in the last part of the network. Training octic ViTs supervised (DeiT-III) and unsupervised (DINOv2) on ImageNet-1K, we find that they match baseline accuracy while at the same time providing substantial efficiency gains.

<title>Beyond Early-Token Bias: Model-Specific and Language-Specific Position Effects in Multilingual LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit position bias - a systematic tendency to neglect information at specific context positions. However, the patterns of position bias behavior, depending on the language or model, remain unexplored. We present a multilingual study across five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi, and Vietnamese) and five model architectures, examining how position bias interacts with prompt strategies and affects output entropy. Our key findings are: (1) Position bias is primarily model-driven, yet exhibits language-specific variations. For instance, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and DeepSeek 7B Chat consistently favors late positions, challenging established assumptions of a universal early-token bias in LLMs. (2) Explicitly instructing the model that "the context is relevant to the query" unexpectedly reduces accuracy across languages, undermining common prompt-engineering practices. (3) While the largest accuracy drop occurs when relevant information is placed in the middle of the context, this is not explicitly reflected by a corresponding peak in output entropy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs) combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning, gradient-calculation or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models and how they affect RAG behaviours. Our code is available at https://github.com/ruizheliUOA/ARC_JSD.

<title>Unlearning Isn't Deletion: Investigating Reversibility of Machine Unlearning in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16831</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.16831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) aims to remove specified data, but its efficacy is typically assessed with task-level metrics like accuracy and perplexity. We demonstrate that these metrics are often misleading, as models can appear to forget while their original behavior is easily restored through minimal fine-tuning. This phenomenon of \emph{reversibility} suggests that information is merely suppressed, not genuinely erased. To address this critical evaluation gap, we introduce a \emph{representation-level analysis framework}. Our toolkit comprises PCA-based similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment (CKA), and Fisher information, complemented by a summary metric, the mean PCA distance, to measure representational drift. Applying this framework across six unlearning methods, three data domains, and two LLMs, we identify four distinct forgetting regimes based on their \emph{reversibility} and \emph{catastrophicity}. Our analysis reveals that achieving the ideal state--irreversible, non-catastrophic forgetting--is exceptionally challenging. By probing the limits of unlearning, we identify a case of seemingly irreversible, targeted forgetting, offering new insights for designing more robust erasure algorithms. Our findings expose a fundamental gap in current evaluation practices and establish a representation-level foundation for trustworthy unlearning.

arXiv:2505.16965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence, capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

<title>Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment Protocol for Semantic Communication in AI Agent Networks</title>

arXiv:2505.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future networks are envisioned to connect massive artificial intelligence (AI) agents, enabling their extensive collaboration on diverse tasks. Compared to traditional entities, these agents naturally suit the semantic communication (SC), which can significantly enhance the bandwidth efficiency. Nevertheless, SC requires the knowledge among agents to be aligned, while agents have distinct expert knowledge for their individual tasks in practice. In this paper, we propose a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment protocol (DeKAP), which distills the expert knowledge of each agent into parameter-efficient low-rank matrices, allocates them across the network, and allows agents to simultaneously maintain aligned knowledge for multiple tasks. We formulate the joint minimization of alignment loss, communication overhead, and storage cost as a large-scale integer linear programming problem and develop a highly efficient greedy algorithm. From computer simulation, the DeKAP establishes knowledge alignment with the lowest communication and computation resources compared to conventional approaches.

arXiv:2505.20321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomedical researchers increasingly rely on large-scale structured databases for complex analytical tasks. However, current text-to-SQL systems often struggle to map qualitative scientific questions into executable SQL, particularly when implicit domain reasoning is required. We introduce BiomedSQL, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scientific reasoning in text-to-SQL generation over a real-world biomedical knowledge base. BiomedSQL comprises 68,000 question/SQL query/answer triples grounded in a harmonized BigQuery knowledge base that integrates gene-disease associations, causal inference from omics data, and drug approval records. Each question requires models to infer domain-specific criteria, such as genome-wide significance thresholds, effect directionality, or trial phase filtering, rather than rely on syntactic translation alone. We evaluate a range of open- and closed-source LLMs across prompting strategies and interaction paradigms. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap: GPT-o3-mini achieves 59.0% execution accuracy, while our custom multi-step agent, BMSQL, reaches 62.6%, both well below the expert baseline of 90.0%. BiomedSQL provides a new foundation for advancing text-to-SQL systems capable of supporting scientific discovery through robust reasoning over structured biomedical knowledge bases. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NIH-CARD/BiomedSQL, and our code is open-source at https://github.com/NIH-CARD/biomedsql.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. We propose a novel approach for policy mobilization that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. To understand policy mobilization in more depth, we also introduce the Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, and (3) visualization tools for analysis. In both our developed simulation task suite and the real world, we show that our approach outperforms baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.

<title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>

arXiv:2505.24333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While previous work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, an asymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialise transformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layer normalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithm to compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the key challenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We also analyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradients vanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantee smooth training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose \textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of surveillance cameras has increased the demand for automated violence detection. While CNNs and Transformers have shown success in extracting spatio-temporal features, they struggle with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. We propose Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated Class Token Fusion (GCTF), an efficient architecture combining a dual-branch design and a state-space model (SSM) backbone where one branch captures spatial features, while the other focuses on temporal dynamics. The model performs continuous fusion via a gating mechanism between the branches to enhance the model's ability to detect violent activities even in challenging surveillance scenarios. We also present a new benchmark by merging RWF-2000, RLVS, SURV and VioPeru datasets in video violence detection, ensuring strict separation between training and testing sets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark and also on DVD dataset which is another novel dataset on video violence detection, offering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of SSMs for scalable, near real-time surveillance violence detection.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M FLOPs) at IoT device.

This paper analyzes security degradation in AI-generated code through a controlled experiment with 400 code samples across 40 rounds of "improvements" using four distinct prompting strategies. Our findings show a 37.6% increase in critical vulnerabilities after just five iterations, with distinct vulnerability patterns emerging across different prompting approaches. This evidence challenges the assumption that iterative LLM refinement improves code security and highlights the essential role of human expertise in the loop. We propose practical guidelines for developers to mitigate these risks, emphasizing the need for robust human validation between LLM iterations to prevent the paradoxical introduction of new security issues during supposedly beneficial code "improvements".

Abstract: Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics have become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and gene expression at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial-omics data, we have the promise of characterizing cells within their tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and intra-cellular transcriptional or protein counts. Proteomics offers a complementary view by directly measuring proteins, which are the primary effectors of cellular function and key therapeutic targets. However, existing models either ignore the spatial information or the complex genetic and proteomic programs within cells. Thus they cannot infer how cell internal regulation adapts to microenvironmental cues. Furthermore, these models often utilize fixed gene vocabularies, hindering their generalizability unseen genes. In this paper, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. HEIST models tissues as hierarchical graphs. The higher level graph is a spatial cell graph, and each cell in turn, is represented by its lower level gene co-expression network graph. HEIST achieves this by performing both intra-level and cross-level message passing to utilize the hierarchy in its embeddings and can thus generalize to novel datatypes including spatial proteomics without retraining. HEIST is pretrained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive and masked autoencoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST embeddings reveals spatially informed subpopulations missed by prior models. Downstream evaluations demonstrate generalizability to proteomics data and state-of-the-art performance in clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, and gene imputation across multiple technologies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances across numerous vision-language tasks. MLLMs have shown promising capability in aligning visual and textual modalities, allowing them to process image-text pairs with clear and explicit meanings. However, resolving the inherent ambiguities present in real-world language and visual contexts remains a challenge. Existing multimodal benchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly on unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual clarification potential between modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MUCAR, a novel and challenging benchmark designed explicitly for evaluating multimodal ambiguity resolution across multilingual and cross-modal scenarios. MUCAR includes first a multilingual dataset where ambiguous textual expressions are uniquely resolved by corresponding visual contexts, and second a dual-ambiguity dataset that systematically pairs ambiguous images with ambiguous textual contexts, with each combination carefully constructed to yield a single, clear interpretation through mutual disambiguation. Extensive evaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both open-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more sophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the boundaries of multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our optimization strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared component is exchanged during communication rounds. Through extensive experiments across eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like mathematics, factual question answering, and code generation, yet their ability to reason on these tasks in different languages remains underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. We propose M2A, a novel method that combines multi-scale multilingual alignment with language-consistency rewards on machine-translated questions, training models to reason directly and accurately in the target language. Furthermore, existing multilingual benchmarks only evaluate on final answers, overlooking whether reasoning occurs in the intended language. To close this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark together with reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. Our results show that M2A significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity in both mathematical and factual reasoning tasks, highlighting that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization. https://jd730.github.io/projects/M2A_GeoFact-X

<title>A Unified Empirical Risk Minimization Framework for Flexible N-Tuples Weak Supervision</title>

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper, we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it. Source code is available at https://github.com/mr-ravin/aptx_neuron.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and mitigation techniques. Instruction tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and RAG frameworks for external knowledge access are also reviewed. The key findings demonstrate the limitations of current metrics, the importance of validated external evidence, and the improvement of factual consistency through domain-specific customization. The review underscores the importance of building more accurate, understandable, and context-aware fact-checking. These insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy models.

Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning research has expanded rapidly due to potential computational advantages over classical methods. Angle encoding has emerged as a popular choice as feature map (FM) for embedding classical data into quantum models due to its simplicity and natural generation of truncated Fourier series, providing universal function approximation capabilities. Efficient FMs within quantum circuits can exploit exponential scaling of Fourier frequencies, with multi-dimensional inputs introducing additional exponential growth through mixed-frequency terms. Despite this promising expressive capability, practical implementation faces significant challenges. Through controlled experiments with white-box target functions, we demonstrate that training failures can occur even when all relevant frequencies are theoretically accessible. We illustrate how two primary known causes lead to unsuccessful optimization: insufficient trainable parameters relative to the model's frequency content, and limitations imposed by the ansatz's dynamic lie algebra dimension, but also uncover an additional parameter burden: the necessity of controlling non-unique frequencies within the model. To address this, we propose near-zero weight initialization to suppress unnecessary duplicate frequencies. For target functions with a priori frequency knowledge, we introduce frequency selection as a practical solution that reduces parameter requirements and mitigates the exponential growth that would otherwise render problems intractable due to parameter insufficiency. Our frequency selection approach achieved near-optimal performance (median $R^2 \approx 0.95$) with 78\% of the parameters needed by the best standard approach in 10 randomly chosen target functions.

Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training. Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their \textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric notion of difficulty is adopted.

Abstract: Causal inference in settings involving complex spatio-temporal dependencies, such as environmental epidemiology, is challenging due to the presence of unmeasured confounding. However, a significant gap persists in existing methods: current diffusion-based causal models rely on restrictive assumptions of causal sufficiency or static confounding. To address this limitation, we introduce the Partially Functional Dynamic Backdoor Diffusion-based Causal Model (PFD-BDCM), a generative framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach uniquely incorporates valid backdoor adjustments into the diffusion sampling mechanism to mitigate bias from unmeasured confounders. Specifically, it captures their intricate dynamics through region-specific structural equations and conditional autoregressive processes, and accommodates multi-resolution variables via functional data techniques. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees by establishing error bounds for counterfactual estimates. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and a real-world air pollution case study confirm that PFD-BDCM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al., 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted consensus judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify subjective traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Hence, to validate our method, we collect human judgments on the same ensemble of models and show that EigenBench's judgments align closely with those of human evaluators. We further demonstrate that EigenBench can recover model rankings on the GPQA benchmark without access to objective labels, supporting its viability as a framework for evaluating subjective values for which no ground truths exist.

Abstract: This paper studies decentralized optimization problem $f(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(\mathbf{x})$, where each local function has the form of $f_i(\mathbf{x}) = {\mathbb E}\left[F(\mathbf{x};{\boldsymbol \xi}_i)\right]$ which is $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth but possibly nonconvex and the random variable ${\boldsymbol \xi}_i$ follows distribution ${\mathcal D}_i$. We propose a novel algorithm called decentralized normalized stochastic gradient descent (DNSGD), which can achieve an $\epsilon$-stationary point at each local agent. We present a new framework for analyzing decentralized first-order methods in the relaxed smooth setting, based on the Lyapunov function related to the product of the gradient norm and the consensus error. We show the upper bounds on the sample complexity of ${\mathcal O}(m^{-1}(L_f\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-4} + \sigma^2\epsilon^{-2} + L_f^{-2}L_1^3\sigma^2\Delta_f\epsilon^{-1} + L_f^{-2}L_1^2\sigma^2))$ per agent and the communication complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}((L_f\epsilon^{-2} + L_1\epsilon^{-1})\gamma^{-1/2}\Delta_f)$, where $L_f=L_0 +L_1\zeta$, $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the stochastic gradient, $\Delta_f$ is the initial optimal function value gap, $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the network, and $\zeta$ is the degree of the gradient dissimilarity. In the special case of $L_1=0$, the above results (nearly) match the lower bounds of decentralized stochastic nonconvex optimization under the standard smoothness. We also conduct numerical experiments to show the empirical superiority of our method.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.

Abstract: Logic reasoning in natural language has been recognized as an important measure of human intelligence for Large Language Models (LLMs). Popular benchmarks may entangle multiple reasoning skills and thus provide unfaithful evaluations on the logic reasoning skill. Meanwhile, existing logic reasoning benchmarks are limited in language diversity and their distributions are deviated from the distribution of an ideal logic reasoning benchmark, which may lead to biased evaluation results. This paper thereby proposes a new classical logic benchmark DivLogicEval, consisting of natural sentences composed of diverse statements in a counterintuitive way. To ensure a more reliable evaluation, we also introduce a new evaluation metric that mitigates the influence of bias and randomness inherent in LLMs. Through experiments, we demonstrate the extent to which logical reasoning is required to answer the questions in DivLogicEval and compare the performance of different popular LLMs in conducting logical reasoning.

Abstract: Audio super-resolution (SR), i.e., upsampling the low-resolution (LR) waveform to the high-resolution (HR) version, has recently been explored with diffusion and bridge models, while previous methods often suffer from sub-optimal upsampling quality due to their uninformative generation prior. Towards high-quality audio super-resolution, we present a new system with latent bridge models (LBMs), where we compress the audio waveform into a continuous latent space and design an LBM to enable a latent-to-latent generation process that naturally matches the LR-toHR upsampling process, thereby fully exploiting the instructive prior information contained in the LR waveform. To further enhance the training results despite the limited availability of HR samples, we introduce frequency-aware LBMs, where the prior and target frequency are taken as model input, enabling LBMs to explicitly learn an any-to-any upsampling process at the training stage. Furthermore, we design cascaded LBMs and present two prior augmentation strategies, where we make the first attempt to unlock the audio upsampling beyond 48 kHz and empower a seamless cascaded SR process, providing higher flexibility for audio post-production. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated on the VCTK, ESC-50, Song-Describer benchmark datasets and two internal testsets demonstrate that we achieve state-of-the-art objective and perceptual quality for any-to-48kHz SR across speech, audio, and music signals, as well as setting the first record for any-to-192kHz audio SR.

Abstract: In computational physics, a longstanding challenge lies in finding numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, research attention has increasingly focused on Neural Operator methods, which are notable for their ability to approximate operators-mappings between functions. Although neural operators benefit from a universal approximation theorem, achieving reliable error bounds often necessitates large model architectures, such as deep stacks of Fourier layers. This raises a natural question: Can we design lightweight models without sacrificing generalization? To address this, we introduce DimINO (Dimension-Informed Neural Operators), a framework inspired by dimensional analysis. DimINO incorporates two key components, DimNorm and a redimensionalization operation, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing neural operator architectures. These components enhance the model's ability to generalize across datasets with varying physical parameters. Theoretically, we establish a universal approximation theorem for DimINO and prove that it satisfies a critical property we term Similar Transformation Invariance (STI). Empirically, DimINO achieves up to 76.3% performance gain on PDE datasets while exhibiting clear evidence of the STI property.

Summary:<br />
The article focuses on offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies in the presence of uncertain disturbances. It examines scenarios where disturbances can be estimated in a controlled environment and when they are unknown in a stochastic setting. The approach combines adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to develop algorithms and sample-based approximations inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) principles. For scenarios involving non-measurable disturbances, stability and convergence guarantees for learned control gains are established under sample-based approximations. The methodology aims for simplicity while providing robust guarantees.

Abstract: We analyze offline designs of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategies with uncertain disturbances. First, we consider the scenario where the exogenous variable can be estimated in a controlled environment, and subsequently, consider a more practical and challenging scenario where it is unknown in a stochastic setting. Our approach builds on the fundamental learning-based framework of adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), combined with a Lyapunov-based analytical methodology to design the algorithms and derive sample-based approximations motivated from the Markov decision process (MDP)-based approaches. For the scenario involving non-measurable disturbances, we further establish stability and convergence guarantees for the learned control gains under sample-based approximations. The overall methodology emphasizes simplicity while providing rigorous guarantees. Finally, numerical experiments focus on the intricacies and validations for the design of offline continuous-time LQR with exogenous disturbances.

Summary:
DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model, is introduced to tackle the challenge of synthesizing crystalline materials like zeolites. The model is trained on a vast dataset of synthesis recipes and can generate probable synthesis routes based on a desired zeolite structure and organic template. DiffSyn's performance is top-notch as it can capture the complex structure-synthesis relationships. This model is utilized to distinguish between competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. In a successful demonstration, DiffSyn is used to synthesize a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ ratio of 19.0, which surpasses previous records and is expected to enhance thermal stability. The rationalization of the synthesis routes via density functional theory binding energies adds a layer of credibility to the process. <div>

Abstract: The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose DiffSyn, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000 synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. DiffSyn generates probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an organic template. DiffSyn achieves state-of-the-art performance by capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply DiffSyn to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using DiffSyn-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously recorded.

<div> Distribution Compression, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, Bilateral Distribution Compression, Decoded MMD, Low-Dimensional Projection

Summary:
Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC) is proposed as a two-stage framework for compressing large datasets while preserving the underlying distribution. BDC operates with linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. The Decoded MMD (DMMD) is introduced to quantify the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC utilizes the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD) to learn a low-dimensional projection and the Encoded MMD (EMMD) to optimize a latent compressed set. By minimizing the DMMD, BDC ensures that the compressed set accurately represents the original distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at a significantly lower cost. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.17543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.

Summary: In this paper, the researchers address the issue of redundancy in decision trees within the Rashomon set and its implications on feature importance and accuracy. They introduce the MBDSR approach, utilizing the Quine-McCluskey method to determine predictive equivalence among decision trees. However, they find that the QM method can exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space for certain decision trees. They demonstrate that the MBDSR approach may produce incorrect results in some cases and propose algorithms that can solve related problems in polynomial time. Through experiments, they show that their algorithms are significantly faster than previous methods for decision trees triggering worst-case scenarios with the QM method. This research highlights the importance of efficient methods for decision tree analysis and provides solutions for improving accuracy and computational efficiency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.17774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs, i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work, McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach, which this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space. This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the paper shows that, depending on the QM method implementation, the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the problem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of the problems to which the smallest DNF representation has been applied to can be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the worst-case of the QM method is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Generative flow networks are extended to multi-agent settings with the introduction of MA-GFlowNets, allowing collaborative object generation through joint actions. A theoretical framework for MA-GFlowNets is presented, along with four algorithms: centralized, independent, joint, and updated conditional flow networks. The joint flow network employs a local-global principle for training multiple local networks as a single global network, ensuring efficient training and theoretical guarantees on sample generation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework over traditional reinforcement learning and MCMC methods. <div>
arXiv:2509.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of (local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement learning and MCMC-based methods.

Summary:
FastEagle is introduced as a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that can generate an entire draft in a single forward pass, compared to state-of-the-art drafters like EAGLE that require sequential passes. By using a layer cascade and training with layer-wise supervision, FastEagle minimizes error accumulation. It utilizes a constrained draft tree to maintain lossless verification cost. FastEagle outperforms EAGLE-3 in terms of speedup under both greedy and stochastic decoding, while maintaining competitive acceptance lengths. Testing on various large language models (LLMs) and tasks shows that FastEagle consistently delivers faster inference times without sacrificing quality, indicating that eliminating sequential dependencies in drafting can significantly accelerate LLM generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation. Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior. Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM, Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths. These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

Summary: 
- The study introduces a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to model daily ozone variability and trends in climate models lacking interactive ozone representation due to high computational costs.
- mloz exhibits high fidelity on decadal timescales and can be used online in both UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and German ICON model, producing stable ozone predictions 31 times faster than traditional chemistry schemes.
- Using only atmospheric temperature data as input, mloz accounts for less than 4 percent of total climate model runtimes.
- The parameterization is transferable between different climate models, demonstrating potential adoption in CMIP-level models that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments.
- Particularly beneficial for climate sensitivity simulations, mloz can capture ozone trends and variability that significantly influence atmospheric feedback processes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes. Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31 times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4 percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments, particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback processes.

The article discusses the privacy concerns related to Electroencephalography (EEG) data and the potential risks of re-identification and leakage of personal information. To address these challenges, a transformer-based autoencoder is proposed to anonymize EEG data while maintaining its utility for machine learning tasks. The study focuses on automatic sleep staging as an application and evaluates the effectiveness of the anonymization technique in reducing the re-identifiability of EEG signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the risk of re-identification while still preserving the data's utility for machine learning applications. This finding highlights the importance of safeguarding sensitive EEG data from potential privacy breaches while also enabling its use in beneficial applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications. To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced while preserving its utility for machine learning.

In this study, the researchers investigate the vulnerability of memorization-based influence estimators to adversarial attacks. They demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating memorization scores by proposing a practical attack method involving the calculation of the pseudoinverse of the input data. The attack, which only requires black-box access to model outputs, is shown to be effective across various image classification tasks. The researchers also analyze the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, highlighting the fragility of influence estimates in certain conditions. These findings underscore the significance of addressing vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and emphasize the importance of implementing robust defenses in machine learning systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack (calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MemAttack-5413/

<div> contrastive representations, temporal distances, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, successor representations, quasimetric distance

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) that combines contrastive representations and temporal distances. By utilizing a quasimetric representation space with additional constraints, the proposed method can learn optimal goal-reaching policies even in suboptimal data and stochastic environments. This approach bridges the gap between the stability of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods and the flexibility of quasimetric network parameterizations. Empirical results show that the new representation learning objective enhances performance on stitching tasks where contrastive learning methods struggle, as well as in noisy, high-dimensional environments where quasimetric network methods encounter challenges. Overall, the unified framework offers improved capabilities for solving goal-reaching tasks with a combination of stability and adaptability. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn "successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric) distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a **quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments. This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on quasimetric networks struggle.

A gating network filters out noisy channels to enhance data reliability. A novel loss function combines supervised and contrastive learning for improved generalization.

arXiv:2509.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species, autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization through innovative architectural and loss design.

<div> Keywords: clustering, rule-guided, multimodal, domain-specific constraints, variational autoencoder

Summary: 
The Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE) introduces a rule-guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain-specific constraints into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data-driven features into a unified latent space, enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. By treating rules as first-class learning signals and integrating them into the clustering process, DARTVAE produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets show that rule-guided clustering improves traditional clustering metrics and yields more meaningful clusters, such as isolating UAVs or separating SUVs from sedans. However, challenges include rule hallucinations, overfitting, and scalability issues. DARTVAE demonstrates the utility of constraint-guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge-intensive domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models, highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for complex, knowledge intensive settings.

<div> Keywords: Attention layers, sequence-to-sequence mapping, sparsity, recurrent dependence, tree-structured matrices 

Summary: 
Attention layers in sequence-to-sequence mapping depend on pairwise interactions, leading to quadratic scaling of memory and compute with sequence length. To address this, sparsity or recurrent dependence is introduced, both with drawbacks. A novel algorithm proposed combines advantages of both by efficiently inverting tree-structured matrices. This innovation aims to improve computational efficiency and overcome the limitations of existing methods, offering a promising solution for handling large-scale sequence processing tasks. <div>

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Summary: 
This paper presents a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent full-field damage in concrete using an auto-regressive U-Net model combined with a convolutional neural network. The model predicts the evolution of the damage field in a unit cell based on microstructural geometry and shrinkage profile. By using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent predictions, the model allows for continuous assessment of damage progression. Additionally, a CNN forecasts key mechanical properties, such as observed shrinkage and residual stiffness, based on the damage estimations. The dual-network architecture shows high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on synthesized datasets. This approach reduces the computational burden of full-field damage evaluations and offers insights into the relationship between aggregate properties and effective shrinkage and stiffness reduction. Overall, this method can aid in optimizing concrete mix designs for improved durability and reduced internal damage.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape, size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness. Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved durability and reduced internal damage.

<div> keywords: Policy gradient methods, entropy maximization, complexity bonus, Proximal Policy Optimization, CDPO

Summary: 
Policy gradient methods often use entropy maximization to balance exploration and exploitation. However, this approach can result in inefficient exploration strategies as it pushes policies towards a uniform random distribution. In response, this work proposes using a complexity bonus instead of entropy. The complexity bonus is a combination of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, encouraging policies that strike a balance between stochasticity and structure. This new approach, named Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), is shown to be more robust to changes in the complexity coefficient compared to traditional methods using entropy coefficients. CDPO promotes the discovery of structured yet adaptable strategies, making it especially effective in environments that require significant exploration. <div>
arXiv:2509.20509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity (high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially in environments requiring greater exploration.

Summary: 
This article presents a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms used in recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements in inverse problems. The algorithms are interpreted as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections, particularly effective when the data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set. By assuming a restricted isometry property of the sensing matrix over the model set, the study establishes quantitative convergence rates that depend on the noise schedule. The framework is applied to uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets, and low-rank Gaussian mixture models, demonstrating global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set. <div>

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors, but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set, we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions: uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy, model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs, respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise. MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Summary: 
Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs) are a novel concept bottleneck model that combines an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic reasoning circuit to produce interpretable predictions. However, NPCs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate attribute predictions. This paper analyzes the adversarial robustness of NPCs and introduces RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit that improves adversarial robustness by integrating outputs from both modules in a class-wise manner. The theoretical analysis shows that RNPC is more resilient to attacks compared to NPCs. Empirical results on image classification tasks demonstrate that RNPC achieves superior robustness against adversarial inputs while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy on benign inputs.

Summary: 
The study compares two hybrid classifiers, XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR), for diabetes risk stratification. XGB-RF outperformed SVM-LR in both internal and external cohorts, achieving higher AUROC and AUPRC values. The performance of XGB-RF remained strong on the external PIMA cohort, with acceptable calibration. Thresholded metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 showed XGB-RF had higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score compared to SVM-LR. The results support the use of XGBoost-based hybridization as a robust and transferable approach for diabetes risk prediction. Prospective multi-site validation and deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs are recommended for further research.

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and (ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe, standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC ~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990; AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941; Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall 0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach for physics-informed generation by framing it as a sparse reward optimization problem. The authors propose Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF) to address issues with prior methods that rely on diffusion posterior sampling. PIRF calculates trajectory-level rewards and directly backpropagates their gradients to ensure adherence to physical constraints. To enhance efficiency, PIRF utilizes a layer-wise truncated backpropagation method tailored to physics-based rewards and a weight-based regularization scheme for improved data fidelity. Results across five PDE benchmarks demonstrate that PIRF consistently outperforms existing methods in enforcing physical constraints while maintaining efficient sampling. This study showcases the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific generative modeling. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.20570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However, a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes, highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific generative modeling.

Summary:
Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) aim to provide predictive uncertainty in scientific applications, helping to identify when a model may be extrapolating or when more data is needed. However, accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) with BNNs can be challenging due to the complexity of hyperparameter choices and the approximations used in model training. A global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under various hyperparameter settings revealed that hyperparameters interact to impact both predictive accuracy and UQ. To enhance the practical use of BNNs, it is recommended to use global sensitivity analysis or Bayesian optimization to reduce dimensionality and select hyperparameters effectively. By improving hyperparameter selection, researchers can ensure accurate UQ in Bayesian Neural Networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective representations.

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel class of stable and near-reversible Runge-Kutta schemes for neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes offer memory-efficient training without sacrificing stability, allowing for accurate gradient computations in a scalable manner. Previous approaches to backpropagation through neural SDE solvers have been hindered by either high memory costs or slow evaluation speeds, but the EES schemes aim to overcome these limitations by combining the benefits of reversible solvers with improved stability. By demonstrating superior performance in numerical experiments, the EES schemes prove to be a practical foundation for effectively training neural SDEs, enabling efficient and accurate gradient computations even in complex models with large step sizes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs. These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Summary:
Function encoders, a novel technique, learn neural network basis functions to create adaptive representations of function Hilbert spaces. They establish a connection to feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through the learned feature map's inner product. This kernel perspective explains their ability to scale independently of dataset size while conforming to data structure, enabling kernel-style analysis of neural models. Two training algorithms are developed: a progressive approach that incrementally builds bases and a train-then-prune method post-training. Both use PCA principles to reveal the learned space's intrinsic dimension. Generalization bounds are derived using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques, ensuring inference time guarantees. Experimental validation on polynomial and nonlinear dynamical systems illustrates achieving comparable accuracy with fewer basis functions. This research paves the way for neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, delivering adaptable, efficient, and principled models at scale.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and principled at scale.

Summary: 
Mutual information (MI) is a challenging quantity to estimate for complex systems, but denoising diffusion models have shown promise in improving this estimation. By utilizing the information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, this study demonstrates a straightforward approach to estimating MI. The MI is calculated as half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. This method not only passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. Additionally, adaptive importance sampling is leveraged to achieve scalable MI estimation, maintaining strong performance even at high MI values. Overall, the use of denoising diffusion models offers a promising avenue for improving mutual information estimation in complex systems.

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI. In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong performance even when the MI is high.

Summary: <br />
Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is a process where an agent improves its skills over time through experience. However, evolving skills may not be compatible with existing policies, limiting their reusability. The SIL-C framework addresses this issue by ensuring compatibility between evolving skills and policies without the need for re-training. It uses a mapping technique to align subtask space with skill space, allowing each subtask to be executed efficiently by selecting the right skill. SIL-C was tested in various scenarios and proved to maintain compatibility while enhancing performance. <div>

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies, limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C, a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring efficiency throughout the learning process.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing, modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion, model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and (iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable, theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenges in training Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex multi-turn task planning. By transforming the multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems and utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense reward from expert trajectories, the proposed method achieves efficient policy optimization. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning leads to higher success probability in multi-turn tasks under minimal turns and generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental results show that a 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO outperforms larger baseline models up to 14B parameters in complex task planning, achieving success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. The strong cross-task generalizability is validated, showing that models trained on complex tasks can successfully complete all simpler subtasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler subtasks.

Summary:
Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL) is a novel federated learning framework that addresses data privacy constraints in multi-site functional MRI studies. It enables collaborative modeling without sharing raw data by performing independent dictionary learning at each site. PFedDL decomposes site-specific dictionaries into shared global components and personalized local components. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to ensure cross-site consistency, while the local atoms capture site-specific variability. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset show that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets. This innovative approach allows for more efficient and effective analysis of neuroimaging data while respecting data privacy constraints.

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site, decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID datasets.

Summary: 
The paper explores the use of Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) in music conversation and investigates if these models truly listen to audio or rely on textual reasoning. They implement the MM-SHAP framework to quantify the contribution of each modality to the model's output on the MuChoMusic benchmark. The study reveals that models with higher accuracy tend to rely more on text for answering questions. However, even when the overall audio contribution is low, models can still effectively identify key sound events, indicating that audio is not completely disregarded. This research is the first to apply MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs, paving the way for future studies in explainable AI and audio analysis.

arXiv:2509.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low, models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in explainable AI and audio.

<div> Keywords: multi-agent reinforcement learning, artificial curiosity, exploration, intrinsic motivation, decentralized settings

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework called CERMIC that aims to improve exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios with sparse rewards. Existing artificial curiosity mechanisms often fail to distinguish between true novelty and stochastic environmental variability, leading to suboptimal exploration. CERMIC addresses this issue by dynamically adjusting agents' intrinsic curiosity based on multi-agent context, allowing them to filter out irrelevant surprises. This framework generates intrinsic rewards that incentivize agents to explore state transitions that provide significant information gain. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that exploration with CERMIC outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in sparse-reward environments, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing multi-agent exploration in communication-free decentralized settings. <div>
arXiv:2509.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked, resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in sparse-reward environments.

Summary: <br />
The study focuses on using machine learning to predict the resources needed for massively parallel chemistry computations, specifically coupled-cluster methods, to assist users in planning experiments on supercomputers. The research addresses two main questions: finding the optimal parameter configurations for shortest execution time and minimizing resource usage. By evaluating various ML models and strategies using data from CCSD application runs on DOE's Frontier and Aurora supercomputers, the study achieves a high level of accuracy in predicting execution times. A Gradient Boosting model performs well in predicting CCSD iteration times on both supercomputers, with minimal errors. Additionally, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using active learning to reduce the number of experiments needed to collect data points, producing accurate predictions with a limited number of data samples. <div>
arXiv:2509.20667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE) Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from Aurora and Frontier.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a non-asymptotic lower bound linking the minimal number of demonstrations required for stable in-context learning (ICL) to prompt length sensitivity. It establishes explicit sufficient conditions based on the spectral properties of covariance, offering a practical criterion for implementation. The proposed two-stage observable estimator, with one-shot calibration, provides prompt-length estimates without distributional priors. Experimental results demonstrate the close alignment between predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with the theory acting as a reliable upper bound. Furthermore, the calibrated variant tightens this gap, enhancing the interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in finite-sample regimes. This research connects spectral coverage to stable ICL, bridging theory with deployment, and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of large-scale prompt-based learning systems.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance, providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points, with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic finite-sample regimes.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning, graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class or content.

<br />
Summary: In the study, the authors explore the use of federated learning (FL) for collaborative fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) while preserving privacy. Despite the belief that FL protects privacy by aggregating generalized knowledge in a global model, the findings reveal that attackers can still extract training data from the model. This privacy leakage increases with the model size and can be exacerbated by an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL. To address these privacy risks, the study evaluates various techniques including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates, and safety alignment in LLMs. These results offer valuable insights and practical guidelines for organizations looking to mitigate privacy risks when fine-tuning LLMs using federated learning. <div>
arXiv:2509.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains. Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers can still extract training data from the global model, even using straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL, including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Summary: 
FIRM-DTI is a new framework for accurately predicting drug-target binding affinity using deep learning. It combines molecular and protein embeddings using a feature-wise linear modulation layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss, resulting in smooth and interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its small size, FIRM-DTI outperforms existing models on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark. An extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation demonstrate its effectiveness. This framework highlights the importance of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction. <div>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening. While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark, as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation. Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust drug-target affinity prediction.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

Summary:
SynGA is a genetic algorithm specifically designed to operate directly on synthesis routes in molecular design. It features custom crossover and mutation operators that ensure synthesizability of the generated molecules, making it effective for various design tasks like synthesizable analog search and property optimization in both 2D and 3D dimensions. By modifying the fitness function and coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter for building blocks, the algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. SynGBO, a variant of SynGA, combines it with block filtering in Bayesian optimization for efficient property optimization. Due to its lightweight nature and inherent focus on synthesizability, SynGA can serve as a strong standalone baseline and be seamlessly integrated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future. <div>

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

<div> Keywords: scaling laws, deep learning, redundancy laws, data covariance spectrum, model performance<br />
Summary:<br />
The study explores the mathematical underpinnings of scaling laws in deep learning, uncovering a connection to redundancy laws. By employing kernel regression, the researchers demonstrate that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum leads to an excess risk power law with a specific exponent. This exponent is determined by the spectral tail parameter beta, reflecting the level of redundancy in the data. The slope of the learning curve is shown to depend on data redundancy, with steeper spectra resulting in accelerated returns to scale. The universality of these findings is validated across various transformations, mixtures, approximations, and architectures, including Transformer models. This work provides a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations, and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations with theoretical foundations.

<div> Keywords: audio watermarking, anti-spoofing systems, domain shift, Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning, benchmark

Summary:
This paper introduces a study on the impact of audio watermarking on anti-spoofing systems. By creating the Watermark-Spoofing dataset with various watermarking techniques, the researchers found that watermarking consistently decreases the performance of anti-spoofing systems, with higher watermark density leading to higher error rates. To address this issue, they propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, allowing models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while maintaining their original spoofing detection capability. These results highlight audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and provide a benchmark for developing anti-spoofing systems resilient to watermarks. The related protocols can be accessed at https://github.com/Alphawarheads/Watermark_Spoofing.git.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets, named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL) framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

Summary:
The study compares Transformer-based models GReaT and REaLTabFormer for synthetic tabular data generation. It evaluates the impact of hyperparameters on runtime, machine learning utility, and similarity to real data distributions across different model setups. Results show that runtime increases with the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT outperforms REaLTabFormer in runtime efficiency, but REaLTabFormer maintains high utility and similarity on larger datasets. REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs strikes the best balance between data quality and computational requirements. Despite efficiency gains, there is a limit to reducing runtime. The study suggests that lightweight LLMs can enhance efficiency without compromising data quality for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware. This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless, its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

<div> machine learning, learned indexes, dynamic updates, retraining cost, Sig2Model

Summary: 
Sig2Model is a novel approach to efficient and adaptive learned indexing that addresses the challenges of dynamic updates. By utilizing a sigmoid boosting approximation technique, the index model can be dynamically adjusted to account for shifts in data distribution without the need for full retraining, reducing retraining costs. Proactive update training using Gaussian mixture models allows for strategic placeholder allocation in high-update-probability regions, further speeding up updates. A neural joint optimization framework continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters, improving overall performance. In evaluations against existing approaches, Sig2Model demonstrated a reduction in retraining cost by up to 20x, achieved up to 3x higher queries-per-second (QPS), and used significantly less memory, making it a promising solution for real-world workloads with frequent updates. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS) metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively, rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS, and uses up to 1000x less memory.

Summary:
- The article introduces a novel approach that combines multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to improve multivariate time-series forecasting.
- MLP models are effective in capturing long-term dependencies but struggle with diverse distributions and local variations in data.
- CNNs are better at incorporating these variations, so the proposed model combines MLP for overall trend modeling and CNN for capturing fine-grained local patterns.
- The proposed architecture, IConv, processes temporal dependency channels independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers, allowing for efficient modeling of diverse local temporal patterns.

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions, resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

Summary:
This article discusses the challenge of data efficiency in large-scale models due to the finite nature of high-quality data. It introduces a framework to improve data efficiency by formalizing the inductive bias of linear time-invariant State Space Models (SSMs) through an SSM-induced kernel. The method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI) is proposed, specifically power spectrum matching, to align the model's bias with the task's spectral characteristics before training. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TDI significantly enhances generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data scenarios. This work presents a theoretical and practical approach to developing more data-efficient models, contributing to the sustainable scaling of machine learning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge. One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

Summary:
Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer robustness from teacher to student without accessing training data. However, existing methods overlook robust fairness issues, causing significant variation in robustness across different categories. Two key problems were identified: variations in student behavior across categories with equal class proportions and instability of student robustness across different attack targets. To address these issues, Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework was introduced. FERD adjusts the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples by implementing robustness-guided class reweighting and generating Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) and Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs). Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under various adversarial attacks, improving robustness and fairness simultaneously.<br /><br />Summary: Data-Free Robustness Distillation transfers robustness but neglects fairness, leading to disparities. FERD addresses this by adjusting proportions and distributions of adversarial examples, improving worst-class robustness and fairness simultaneously. <div>

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues, leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and (2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack (e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by 15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Summary: 
The article introduces T2I-Diff, a framework for generating fMRI data that addresses the limitations of existing generative models. By leveraging time-frequency representation and classifier-free denoising diffusion, T2I-Diff captures complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. The framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms using a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. A classifier-free diffusion model is then trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are converted back to BOLD signals. The efficacy of the approach is validated through improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.<br />

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform, capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution. Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning. CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&amp;A tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies, and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style. Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation models.

<br />Summary: 
This work aims to explain late-phase phenomena in deep neural networks, such as grokking and the information bottleneck principle. The authors propose a unified explanation based on the concept of neural collapse, which involves the contraction of population within-class variance in learned representations. They show that this measure is key to understanding both grokking and the information bottleneck effect. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, the authors demonstrate that the differences in time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse can account for the behavior of late-phase phenomena. The theoretical findings are validated on various datasets and neural network architectures. <div>
arXiv:2509.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

<div> Keywords: multi-modal fusion, effective competitive strength, mutual information, FastPID, asynchronous training

Summary:
In the study, a two-stage training framework is proposed to address modality competition in multi-modal fusion. The concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) is introduced to quantify a modality's dominance during training. The framework utilizes mutual information (MI) as a proxy for ECS and develops the FastPID solver for partial information decomposition. An asynchronous training controller dynamically balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and synergy. By shaping the initial states through unimodal training, the method achieves a tighter error bound and better performance in multi-modal fusion tasks. The approach proves to be effective in mitigating modality competition and enhancing synergy among different modalities. The experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method in multi-modal fusion tasks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of pre-fusion model initialization in optimizing multi-modal fusion. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state, most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples, including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them. Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches, and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions.

<div> Keywords: Time series generation, conditional models, causal perspective, CaTSG, interventions, counterfactuals

Summary: 
This article introduces the concept of causal time series generation (CaTSG), which goes beyond traditional conditional models by considering unobserved confounding and incorporating interventions and counterfactual scenarios. The CaTSG framework utilizes Pearl's causal ladder to guide the generation process, allowing for the creation of realistic time series sequences under different causal conditions. By incorporating backdoor adjustment and causal score functions, CaTSG can generate sequences that accurately reflect the effects of interventions and individual counterfactuals. Experimental results demonstrate that CaTSG outperforms existing baselines in terms of fidelity and support for interventional and counterfactual generation. The proposed causal TSG family and the CaTSG framework represent a novel approach to time series synthesis, offering promising possibilities for more reliable simulation in various causal scenarios.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings. To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and counterfactual generation.

<div> Keywords: newborns, artificial intelligence, fetal heart rate monitoring, missing data, autoencoder<br />
Summary:<br />
Approximately 10% of newborns require breathing assistance at birth, and 5% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is crucial for assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care and detecting abnormal patterns. AI methods can analyze large FHR datasets to predict the risk of interventions. Wearable FHR monitors allow continuous monitoring but face signal dropouts due to sensor displacement. The proposed masked transformer-based autoencoder can reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing spatial and frequency components, preserving spectral characteristics. This approach is robust for varying durations of missing data, enabling signal inpainting and forecasting. It can be applied to research datasets for developing AI-based risk algorithms and potentially integrated into wearable FHR monitors for early risk detection. <br /><br />Summary: 
- Newborns often need breathing assistance at birth, with FHR monitoring being critical for fetal well-being assessment.
- AI analysis of FHR data can predict the need for interventions based on diverse outcomes.
- Wearable FHR monitors face signal dropouts, which the proposed autoencoder can reconstruct robustly.
- This approach preserves signal characteristics and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting.
- Integration into wearable devices could enhance early risk detection. <div>

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated (AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more robust risk detection.

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines, especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts. However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles, including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought (AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale. Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

<title>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Random Observation Delays</title>

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

<title>Distribution-Controlled Client Selection to Improve Federated Learning Strategies</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution. Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance, alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for global imbalance.

<title>Improving Early Sepsis Onset Prediction Through Federated Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20885</link>

arXiv:2509.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated, attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction, trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons, enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model. During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance (with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and organizational overhead.

arXiv:2509.20896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

<title>Deep Learning for Crime Forecasting: The Role of Mobility at Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Scales</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20913</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to 2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq. miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression, random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance, especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision, and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes, while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency, with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve (PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve. The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment, therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid, implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

<title>Why Attention Fails: The Degeneration of Transformers into MLPs in Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments, progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon, demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

<title>Decoupled-Value Attention for Prior-Data Fitted Networks: GP Inference for Physical Equations</title>

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values. Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture, showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

<title>Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy</title>

arXiv:2509.20952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich, complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via 'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing individualized treatments for patients.

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance. Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12 real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

<title>Toward Robust and Efficient ML-Based GPU Caching for Modern Inference</title>

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.

<title>Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S \subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto \exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$ that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for $k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without [Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA '24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC '19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the truncated Ising model.

<title>Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor.

<title>Feature Augmentation of GNNs for ILPs: Local Uniqueness Suffices</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21000</link>

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme, we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired with a state-of-the-art method.

<title>Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation</title>

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows. However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

<title>ExMolRL: Phenotype-Target Joint Generation of De Novo Molecules via Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21010</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss, prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse, and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective solution for de novo drug discovery.

<title>Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.

<title>Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities, which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge, showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over 100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

<title>DELTA-Code: How Does RL Unlock and Transfer New Programming Algorithms in LLMs?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21016</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability -- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability, we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory, compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer. Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

<title>Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks, which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse, multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL.

<title>FORCE: Transferable Visual Jailbreaking Attacks via Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities. In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability, failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against closed-source MLLMs.

<title>Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning Enhances Activation Intensity and Diversity in the Internal Circuitry of LLMs</title>

arXiv:2509.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training: (i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based approaches.

Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning $\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the stationary trajectories.

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving. Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization, SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

<title>ScaleDiff: Scaling Difficult Problems for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model, which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between "Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a 65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500, outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code: https://github.com/QizhiPei/ScaleDiff.

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both. TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph, transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure. Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at https://graphuniverse.streamlit.app.

<title>Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as \textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs) to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence. The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

<title>EvoMail: Self-Evolving Cognitive Agents for Adaptive Spam and Phishing Email Defense</title>

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters. Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers, senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam, SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing threats.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting. Our code is available at https://github.com/killian31/SPCARobustness.

<title>LAVA: Explainability for Unsupervised Latent Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However, without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities (neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly distant regions of the latent spaces.

<title>CAD-Tokenizer: Towards Text-based CAD Prototyping via Modality-Specific Tokenization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline. However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

<title>GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on training time and cost.

<title>DATS: Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling for Calibrated Class-Incremental Learning</title>

arXiv:2509.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective, relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS), which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>Mixture of Thoughts: Learning to Aggregate What Experts Think, Not Just What They Say</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain (e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i) route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii) aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii) fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity. We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further, MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jacobfa/mot.

<title>A Unified Framework for Diffusion Model Unlearning with f-Divergence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model. While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities, existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences, that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

<title>Closed-form $\ell_r$ norm scaling with data for overparameterized linear regression and diagonal linear networks under $\ell_p$ bias</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21181</link>

arXiv:2509.21181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective $p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p} \rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

<title>Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy</title>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows. This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture, enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD} significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics: local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper, we propose the {\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral {\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection, anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation, and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions, simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making. Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain generalization techniques ...

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art. Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization. This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT, which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance comparable to the centralized baseline.

Abstract: There has been a considerable interest in constrained training of deep neural networks (DNNs) recently for applications such as fairness and safety. Several toolkits have been proposed for this task, yet there is still no industry standard. We present humancompatible.train (https://github.com/humancompatible/train), an easily-extendable PyTorch-based Python package for training DNNs with stochastic constraints. We implement multiple previously unimplemented algorithms for stochastically constrained stochastic optimization. We demonstrate the toolkit use by comparing two algorithms on a deep learning task with fairness constraints.

<title>A Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Model for Multi-Region and Multi-Pollutant Air Quality Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health, environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

<title>SuperOffload: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale LLM Training on Superchips</title>

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package, which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently. SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems, enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of 13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while achieving 55% MFU.

<title>It's Not You, It's Clipping: A Soft Trust-Region via Probability Smoothing for LLM RL</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21282</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

<title>Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293</link>

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment, invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models), most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm. However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

<title>No Prior, No Leakage: Revisiting Reconstruction Attacks in Trained Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions, portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set, rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance. Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks. Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact, less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need for strong generalization in this setting.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting, and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates, and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for healthcare.

Abstract: By combining AI and fluid physics, we discover a closed-form closure for 2D turbulence from small direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. Large-eddy simulation (LES) with this closure is accurate and stable, reproducing DNS statistics including those of extremes. We also show that the new closure could be derived from a 4th-order truncated Taylor expansion. Prior analytical and AI-based work only found the 2nd-order expansion, which led to unstable LES. The additional terms emerge only when inter-scale energy transfer is considered alongside standard reconstruction criterion in the sparse-equation discovery.

Abstract: Philosophy-informed machine learning (PhIML) directly infuses core ideas from analytic philosophy into ML model architectures, objectives, and evaluation protocols. Therefore, PhIML promises new capabilities through models that respect philosophical concepts and values by design. From this lens, this paper reviews conceptual foundations to demonstrate philosophical gains and alignment. In addition, we present case studies on how ML users/designers can adopt PhIML as an agnostic post-hoc tool or intrinsically build it into ML model architectures. Finally, this paper sheds light on open technical barriers alongside philosophical, practical, and governance challenges and outlines a research roadmap toward safe, philosophy-aware, and ethically responsible PhIML.

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages. Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin) corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion representation.

<title>Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Abstract: ECG biometrics offer a unique, secure authentication method, yet their deployment on wearable devices faces real-time processing, privacy, and spoofing vulnerability challenges. This paper proposes a lightweight deep learning model (MobileNetV1+GRU) for ECG-based authentication, injection of 20dB Gaussian noise & custom preprocessing. We simulate wearable conditions and edge deployment using the ECGID, MIT-BIH, CYBHi, and PTB datasets, achieving accuracies of 99.34%, 99.31%, 91.74%, and 98.49%, F1-scores of 0.9869, 0.9923, 0.9125, and 0.9771, Precision of 0.9866, 0.9924, 0.9180 and 0.9845, Recall of 0.9878, 0.9923, 0.9129, and 0.9756, equal error rates (EER) of 0.0009, 0.00013, 0.0091, and 0.0009, and ROC-AUC values of 0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9985, and 0.9998, while under FGSM adversarial attacks, accuracy drops from 96.82% to as low as 0.80%.

<title>A Comparative Analysis of Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Approaches with Explainable AI for Multi-Class Intrusion Detection in Drone Networks</title>

Abstract: The growing integration of drones into civilian, commercial, and defense sectors introduces significant cybersecurity concerns, particularly with the increased risk of network-based intrusions targeting drone communication protocols. Detecting and classifying these intrusions is inherently challenging due to the dynamic nature of drone traffic and the presence of multiple sophisticated attack vectors such as spoofing, injection, replay, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This research aims to develop a robust and interpretable intrusion detection framework tailored for drone networks, with a focus on handling multi-class classification and model explainability. We present a comparative analysis of ensemble-based machine learning models, namely Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost, trained on a labeled dataset comprising benign traffic and nine distinct intrusion types. Comprehensive data preprocessing was performed, including missing value imputation, scaling, and categorical encoding, followed by model training and extensive evaluation using metrics such as macro F1-score, ROC AUC, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Log Loss. Random Forest achieved the highest performance with a macro F1-score of 0.9998 and ROC AUC of 1.0000. To validate the superiority of the models, statistical tests, including Friedmans test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Holm correction, and bootstrapped confidence intervals, were applied. Furthermore, explainable AI methods, SHAP and LIME, were integrated to interpret both global and local feature importance, enhancing model transparency and decision trustworthiness. The proposed approach not only delivers near-perfect accuracy but also ensures interpretability, making it highly suitable for real-time and safety-critical drone operations.

Abstract: We investigate strategic deception in large language models using two complementary testbeds: Secret Agenda (across 38 models) and Insider Trading compliance (via SAE architectures). Secret Agenda reliably induced lying when deception advantaged goal achievement across all model families. Analysis revealed that autolabeled SAE features for "deception" rarely activated during strategic dishonesty, and feature steering experiments across 100+ deception-related features failed to prevent lying. Conversely, insider trading analysis using unlabeled SAE activations separated deceptive versus compliant responses through discriminative patterns in heatmaps and t-SNE visualizations. These findings suggest autolabel-driven interpretability approaches fail to detect or control behavioral deception, while aggregate unlabeled activations provide population-level structure for risk assessment. Results span Llama 8B/70B SAE implementations and GemmaScope under resource constraints, representing preliminary findings that motivate larger studies on feature discovery, labeling methodology, and causal interventions in realistic deception contexts.

<title>Structuring Collective Action with LLM-Guided Evolution: From Ill-Structured Problems to Executable Heuristics</title>

Abstract: Collective action problems, which require aligning individual incentives with collective goals, are classic examples of Ill-Structured Problems (ISPs). For an individual agent, the causal links between local actions and global outcomes are unclear, stakeholder objectives often conflict, and no single, clear algorithm can bridge micro-level choices with macro-level welfare. We present ECHO-MIMIC, a computational framework that converts this global complexity into a tractable, Well-Structured Problem (WSP) for each agent by discovering compact, executable heuristics and persuasive rationales. The framework operates in two stages: ECHO (Evolutionary Crafting of Heuristics from Outcomes) evolves snippets of Python code that encode candidate behavioral policies, while MIMIC (Mechanism Inference & Messaging for Individual-to-Collective Alignment) evolves companion natural language messages that motivate agents to adopt those policies. Both phases employ a large-language-model-driven evolutionary search: the LLM proposes diverse and context-aware code or text variants, while population-level selection retains those that maximize collective performance in a simulated environment. We demonstrate this framework on a canonical ISP in agricultural landscape management, where local farming decisions impact global ecological connectivity. Results show that ECHO-MIMIC discovers high-performing heuristics compared to baselines and crafts tailored messages that successfully align simulated farmer behavior with landscape-level ecological goals. By coupling algorithmic rule discovery with tailored communication, ECHO-MIMIC transforms the cognitive burden of collective action into a simple set of agent-level instructions, making previously ill-structured problems solvable in practice and opening a new path toward scalable, adaptive policy design.

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose 3D environment generation.

Abstract: Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to traditional numerical simulations in the future.

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work, we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set, and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization, paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical applications.

<title>Objective Evaluation of Prosody and Intelligibility in Speech Synthesis via Conditional Prediction of Discrete Tokens</title>

Abstract: Objective evaluation of synthesized speech is critical for advancing speech generation systems, yet existing metrics for intelligibility and prosody remain limited in scope and weakly correlated with human perception. Word Error Rate (WER) provides only a coarse text-based measure of intelligibility, while F0-RMSE and related pitch-based metrics offer a narrow, reference-dependent view of prosody. To address these limitations, we propose TTScore, a targeted and reference-free evaluation framework based on conditional prediction of discrete speech tokens. TTScore employs two sequence-to-sequence predictors conditioned on input text: TTScore-int, which measures intelligibility through content tokens, and TTScore-pro, which evaluates prosody through prosody tokens. For each synthesized utterance, the predictors compute the likelihood of the corresponding token sequences, yielding interpretable scores that capture alignment with intended linguistic content and prosodic structure. Experiments on the SOMOS, VoiceMOS, and TTSArena benchmarks demonstrate that TTScore-int and TTScore-pro provide reliable, aspect-specific evaluation and achieve stronger correlations with human judgments of overall quality than existing intelligibility and prosody-focused metrics.

<title>Fast Estimation of Wasserstein Distances via Regression on Sliced Wasserstein Distances</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently computing Wasserstein distances for multiple pairs of distributions drawn from a meta-distribution. To this end, we propose a fast estimation method based on regressing Wasserstein distance on sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances. Specifically, we leverage both standard SW distances, which provide lower bounds, and lifted SW distances, which provide upper bounds, as predictors of the true Wasserstein distance. To ensure parsimony, we introduce two linear models: an unconstrained model with a closed-form least-squares solution, and a constrained model that uses only half as many parameters. We show that accurate models can be learned from a small number of distribution pairs. Once estimated, the model can predict the Wasserstein distance for any pair of distributions via a linear combination of SW distances, making it highly efficient. Empirically, we validate our approach on diverse tasks, including Gaussian mixtures, point-cloud classification, and Wasserstein-space visualizations for 3D point clouds. Across various datasets such as MNIST point clouds, ShapeNetV2, MERFISH Cell Niches, and scRNA-seq, our method consistently provides a better approximation of Wasserstein distance than the state-of-the-art Wasserstein embedding model, Wasserstein Wormhole, particularly in low-data regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that our estimator can also accelerate Wormhole training, yielding \textit{RG-Wormhole}.

<title>Adaptive Approach to Enhance Machine Learning Scheduling Algorithms During Runtime Using Reinforcement Learning in Metascheduling Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20520</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands, thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical environments.

<title>A Compound Classification System Based on Fuzzy Relations Applied to the Noise-Tolerant Control of a Bionic Hand via EMG Signal Recognition</title>

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme. Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the literature.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of 96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72 sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent, underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy. When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2% and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual benchmark.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

<title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with an Unobservable Source Subpopulation</title>

arXiv:2509.20587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model. Our open-source code and data is released at https://github.com/chipermaria/every-character-counts.

Abstract: Traditional approaches to network management have been accessible only to a handful of highly-trained network operators with significant expert knowledge. This creates barriers for lay users to easily manage their networks without resorting to experts. With recent development of powerful large language models (LLMs) for language comprehension, we design a system to make network management accessible to a broader audience of non-experts by allowing users to converse with networks in natural language. To effectively leverage advancements in LLMs, we propose an agentic framework that uses an intermediate representation to streamline configuration across diverse vendor equipment, retrieves the network state from memory in real-time, and provides an interface for external feedback. We also conduct pilot studies to collect real user data of natural language utterances for network control, and present a visualization interface to facilitate dialogue-driven user interaction and enable large-scale data collection for future development. Preliminary experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed system components with LLM integration on both synthetic and real user utterances. Through our data collection and visualization efforts, we pave the way for more effective use of LLMs and democratize network control for everyday users.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications are built from specialized components -- inference servers, object storage, vector and graph databases, and user interfaces -- interconnected via web-based APIs. While these components are often containerized and deployed in cloud environments, such capabilities are still emerging at High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers. In this paper, we share our experience deploying GenAI workloads within an established HPC center, discussing the integration of HPC and cloud computing environments. We describe our converged computing architecture that integrates HPC and Kubernetes platforms running containerized GenAI workloads, helping with reproducibility. A case study illustrates the deployment of the Llama Large Language Model (LLM) using a containerized inference server (vLLM) across both Kubernetes and HPC platforms using multiple container runtimes. Our experience highlights practical considerations and opportunities for the HPC container community, guiding future research and tool development.

Moreover, we show that the gapped dimensions lead to lower bounds on offset Rademacher averages, thereby strengthening existing approaches for proving lower bounds on rates of convergence in statistical and online learning.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality. The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together, these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and corresponding latency/throughput gains.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75 in code-topic highlight. Our findings contribute empirical insights and a reusable pipeline for researchers and practitioners interested in code analysis and data-driven software engineering.

Abstract: The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) or imaging mass cytometry (IMC), is challenging because of a competitive sampling process which convolves signals from molecules in a single pixel. To address this, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework that leverages natural sparsity in spatial signal patterns to recover relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS, and has superior posterior coverage than mean-field variational inference techniques. Results on real IMS data demonstrate that our approach better recovers the true anatomical structure of known tissue, removes artifacts, and detects active regions missed by the standard analysis approach.

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck: build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics. Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying, whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting, forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and smarter experiment prioritization.

Abstract: The immense computational cost of simulating turbulence has motivated the use of machine learning approaches for super-resolving turbulent flows. A central challenge is ensuring that learned models respect physical symmetries, such as rotational equivariance. We show that standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can partially acquire this symmetry without explicit augmentation or specialized architectures, as turbulence itself provides implicit rotational augmentation in both time and space. Using 3D channel-flow subdomains with differing anisotropy, we find that models trained on more isotropic mid-plane data achieve lower equivariance error than those trained on boundary layer data, and that greater temporal or spatial sampling further reduces this error. We show a distinct scale-dependence of equivariance error that occurs regardless of dataset anisotropy that is consistent with Kolmogorov's local isotropy hypothesis. These results clarify when rotational symmetry must be explicitly incorporated into learning algorithms and when it can be obtained directly from turbulence, enabling more efficient and symmetry-aware super-resolution.

Abstract: In this paper we show that cryptographic backdoors in a neural network (NN) can be highly effective in two directions, namely mounting the attacks as well as in presenting the defenses as well. On the attack side, a carefully planted cryptographic backdoor enables powerful and invisible attack on the NN. Considering the defense, we present applications: first, a provably robust NN watermarking scheme; second, a protocol for guaranteeing user authentication; and third, a protocol for tracking unauthorized sharing of the NN intellectual property (IP). From a broader theoretical perspective, borrowing the ideas from Goldwasser et. al. [FOCS 2022], our main contribution is to show that all these instantiated practical protocol implementations are provably robust. The protocols for watermarking, authentication and IP tracking resist an adversary with black-box access to the NN, whereas the backdoor-enabled adversarial attack is impossible to prevent under the standard assumptions. While the theoretical tools used for our attack is mostly in line with the Goldwasser et. al. ideas, the proofs related to the defense need further studies. Finally, all these protocols are implemented on state-of-the-art NN architectures with empirical results corroborating the theoretical claims. Further, one can utilize post-quantum primitives for implementing the cryptographic backdoors, laying out foundations for quantum-era applications in machine learning (ML).

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their potential for practical applications.

Abstract: We present a live demonstration for RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system designed to run entirely on a CPU. In single-channel, audio-only settings, speech enhancement is traditionally approached as the task of extracting clean speech from environmental noise. More recent work has explored the use of visual cues, such as lip movements, to improve robustness, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. However, to our knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated an interactive system for real-time audio-visual speech enhancement operating on CPU hardware. RAVEN fills this gap by using pretrained visual embeddings from an audio-visual speech recognition model to encode lip movement information. The system generalizes across environmental noise, interfering speakers, transient sounds, and even singing voices. In this demonstration, attendees will be able to experience live audio-visual target speech enhancement using a microphone and webcam setup, with clean speech playback through headphones.

Abstract: Biopharmaceutical manufacturing is vital to public health but lacks the agility for rapid, on-demand production of biotherapeutics due to the complexity and variability of bioprocesses. To overcome this, we introduce RApid PosTeriOR GENerator (RAPTOR-GEN), a mechanism-informed Bayesian learning framework designed to accelerate intelligent digital twin development from sparse and heterogeneous experimental data. This framework is built on a multi-scale probabilistic knowledge graph (pKG), formulated as a stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based foundational model that captures the nonlinear dynamics of bioprocesses. RAPTOR-GEN consists of two ingredients: (i) an interpretable metamodel integrating linear noise approximation (LNA) that exploits the structural information of bioprocessing mechanisms and a sequential learning strategy to fuse heterogeneous and sparse data, enabling inference of latent state variables and explicit approximation of the intractable likelihood function; and (ii) an efficient Bayesian posterior sampling method that utilizes Langevin diffusion (LD) to accelerate posterior exploration by exploiting the gradients of the derived likelihood. It generalizes the LNA approach to circumvent the challenge of step size selection, facilitating robust learning of mechanistic parameters with provable finite-sample performance guarantees. We develop a fast and robust RAPTOR-GEN algorithm with controllable error. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying regulatory mechanisms of biomanufacturing processes.

<title>Identifying Group Anchors in Real-World Group Interactions Under Label Scarcity</title>

Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&amp;A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&amp;A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight. MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage, even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality of MTRL in robotics applications.

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short, small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to 16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition (FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy. Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

<title>ImaginationPolicy: Towards Generalizable, Precise and Reliable End-to-End Policy for Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks, multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<title>Actively Learning Halfspaces without Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace $f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal $\widetilde{O}(d \log n)$ query algorithm is known due to Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in fact without this power there is an $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).
  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound, we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size $D$, and show tight bounds of $\Theta(D + \log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain an optimal $O(d + \log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$. In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$ provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.
  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\min(D + \log(1/\varepsilon), 1/\varepsilon) \cdot \log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error $\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a $c\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This bound is optimal up to a $\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting.

<title>Single Answer is Not Enough: On Generating Ranked Lists with Medical Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models (MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats: choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation (KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video restoration.

Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance. Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models (CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow). Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance, capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.

Cartesian reverse differential categories axiomatize reverse differentiation in a categorical framework, where one of the primary axioms is the reverse chain rule, which is the formula that expresses the reverse derivative of a composition. Here, we present the reverse differential analogue of Faa di Bruno's Formula, which gives a higher-order reverse chain rule in a Cartesian reverse differential category. To properly do so, we also define partial reverse derivatives and higher-order reverse derivatives in a Cartesian reverse differential category.

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining, clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image clustering methods.

Abstract: The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations. Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time, spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite. Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact, quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

<title>RollPacker: Mitigating Long-Tail Rollouts for Fast, Synchronous RL Post-Training</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a pivotal post-training technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5 family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.

<title>Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?</title>

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models, marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort, outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly central to many applications, raising concerns about bias, fairness, and regulatory compliance. This paper reviews risks of biased outputs and their societal impact, focusing on frameworks like the EU's AI Act and the Digital Services Act. We argue that beyond constant regulation, stronger attention to competition and design governance is needed to ensure fair, trustworthy AI. This is a preprint of the Communications of the ACM article of the same title.

<title>Are Modern Speech Enhancement Systems Vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks?</title>

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.

<title>Best-of-$\infty$ -- Asymptotic Performance of Test-Time Compute</title>

Abstract: We study best-of-$N$ for large language models (LLMs) where the selection is based on majority voting. In particular, we analyze the limit $N \to \infty$, which we denote as Best-of-$\infty$. While this approach achieves impressive performance in the limit, it requires an infinite test-time budget. To address this, we propose an adaptive generation scheme that selects $N$ based on answer agreement, thereby efficiently allocating inference-time computation. Beyond adaptivity, we extend the framework to weighted ensembles of multiple LLMs, showing that such mixtures can outperform any individual model. The optimal ensemble weighting is formulated and efficiently computed as a mixed-integer linear program. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing. 3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order, 3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations. The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess timing degradation from electrode resistance.

<title>The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection</title>

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) facilitates collaborative model training while keeping raw data decentralized, making it a conduit for leveraging the power of IoT devices while maintaining privacy of the locally collected data. However, existing privacy- preserving techniques present notable hurdles. Methods such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential Privacy (DP) often incur high compu- tational costs and suffer from limited scalability. This survey examines emerging approaches that hold promise for enhancing both privacy and efficiency in FL, including Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Quantum Computing (QC), Chaos-Based Encryption (CBE), Neuromorphic Computing (NC), and Swarm Intelligence (SI). For each paradigm, we assess its relevance to the FL pipeline, outlining its strengths, limitations, and practical considerations. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and prospective research avenues, offering a detailed roadmap for advancing secure and scalable FL systems.

<title>WISER: Segmenting watermarked region - an epidemic change-point perspective</title>

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of large language models, concerns over content authenticity have led to the development of myriad watermarking schemes. These schemes can be used to detect a machine-generated text via an appropriate key, while being imperceptible to readers with no such keys. The corresponding detection mechanisms usually take the form of statistical hypothesis testing for the existence of watermarks, spurring extensive research in this direction. However, the finer-grained problem of identifying which segments of a mixed-source text are actually watermarked, is much less explored; the existing approaches either lack scalability or theoretical guarantees robust to paraphrase and post-editing. In this work, we introduce a unique perspective to such watermark segmentation problems through the lens of epidemic change-points. By highlighting the similarities as well as differences of these two problems, we motivate and propose WISER: a novel, computationally efficient, watermark segmentation algorithm. We theoretically validate our algorithm by deriving finite sample error-bounds, and establishing its consistency in detecting multiple watermarked segments in a single text. Complementing these theoretical results, our extensive numerical experiments show that WISER outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods, both in terms of computational speed as well as accuracy, on various benchmark datasets embedded with diverse watermarking schemes. Our theoretical and empirical findings establish WISER as an effective tool for watermark localization in most settings. It also shows how insights from a classical statistical problem can lead to a theoretically valid and computationally efficient solution of a modern and pertinent problem.

<title>Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy</title>

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

<title>Breaking the curse of dimensionality for linear rules: optimal predictors over the ellipsoid</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: In this work, we address the following question: What minimal structural assumptions are needed to prevent the degradation of statistical learning bounds with increasing dimensionality? We investigate this question in the classical statistical setting of signal estimation from $n$ independent linear observations $Y_i = X_i^{\top}\theta + \epsilon_i$. Our focus is on the generalization properties of a broad family of predictors that can be expressed as linear combinations of the training labels, $f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} l_{i}(X) Y_i$. This class -- commonly referred to as linear prediction rules -- encompasses a wide range of popular parametric and non-parametric estimators, including ridge regression, gradient descent, and kernel methods. Our contributions are twofold. First, we derive non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the generalization error for this class under the assumption that the Bayes predictor $\theta$ lies in an ellipsoid. Second, we establish a lower bound for the subclass of rotationally invariant linear prediction rules when the Bayes predictor is fixed. Our analysis highlights two fundamental contributions to the risk: (a) a variance-like term that captures the intrinsic dimensionality of the data; (b) the noiseless error, a term that arises specifically in the high-dimensional regime. These findings shed light on the role of structural assumptions in mitigating the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&amp;R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&amp;R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&amp;R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for calibrating Windkessel (WK) parameters in a dimensionally reduced 1D-0D coupled blood flow model. To this end, we design a data-driven neural network (NN)trained on simulated blood pressures in the left brachial artery. Once trained, the NN emulates the pressure pulse waves across the entire simulated domain, i.e., over time, space and varying WK parameters, with negligible error and computational effort. To calibrate the WK parameters on a measured pulse wave, the NN is extended by dummy neurons and retrained only on these. The main objective of this work is to assess the effectiveness of the method in various scenarios -- particularly, when the exact measurement location is unknown or the data are affected by noise.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions. The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions. Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Abstract: This note responds to "Promises and Pitfalls of Deep Kernel Learning" (Ober et al., 2021). The marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process can be compartmentalized into a data fit term and a complexity penalty. Ober et al. (2021) shows that if a kernel can be multiplied by a signal variance coefficient, then reparametrizing and substituting in the maximized value of this parameter sets a reparametrized data fit term to a fixed value. They use this finding to argue that the complexity penalty, a log determinant of the kernel matrix, then dominates in determining the other values of kernel hyperparameters, which can lead to data overcorrelation. By contrast, we show that the reparametrization in fact introduces another data-fit term which influences all other kernel hyperparameters. Thus, a balance between data fit and complexity still plays a significant role in determining kernel hyperparameters.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction, anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches. Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research domains.

<title>Does FLUX Already Know How to Perform Physically Plausible Image Composition?</title>

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural information about how movements relate to one another, this information is frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.

We also show that maxout polytopes are cubical for generic networks without bottlenecks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Abstract: First-price auctions have very recently swept the online advertising industry, replacing second-price auctions as the predominant auction mechanism on many platforms. This shift has brought forth important challenges for a bidder: how should one bid in a first-price auction, where unlike in second-price auctions, it is no longer optimal to bid one's private value truthfully and hard to know the others' bidding behaviors? In this paper, we take an online learning angle and address the fundamental problem of learning to bid in repeated first-price auctions, where both the bidder's private valuations and other bidders' bids can be arbitrary. We develop the first minimax optimal online bidding algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when competing with the set of all Lipschitz bidding policies, a strong oracle that contains a rich set of bidding strategies. This novel algorithm is built on the insight that the presence of a good expert can be leveraged to improve performance, as well as an original hierarchical expert-chaining structure, both of which could be of independent interest in online learning. Further, by exploiting the product structure that exists in the problem, we modify this algorithm--in its vanilla form statistically optimal but computationally infeasible--to a computationally efficient and space efficient algorithm that also retains the same $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ minimax optimal regret guarantee. Additionally, through an impossibility result, we highlight that one is unlikely to compete this favorably with a stronger oracle (than the considered Lipschitz bidding policies). Finally, we test our algorithm on three real-world first-price auction datasets obtained from Verizon Media and demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to several existing bidding algorithms.

Abstract: We consider a contextual bandit problem with a combinatorial action set and time-varying base arm availability. At the beginning of each round, the agent observes the set of available base arms and their contexts and then selects an action that is a feasible subset of the set of available base arms to maximize its cumulative reward in the long run. We assume that the mean outcomes of base arms are samples from a Gaussian Process (GP) indexed by the context set ${\cal X}$, and the expected reward is Lipschitz continuous in expected base arm outcomes. For this setup, we propose an algorithm called Optimistic Combinatorial Learning and Optimization with Kernel Upper Confidence Bounds (O'CLOK-UCB) and prove that it incurs $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\lambda^*(K)KT\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)} )$ regret with high probability, where $\gamma_{KT}(\cup_{t\leq T}\mathcal{X}_t)$ is the maximum information gain associated with the sets of base arm contexts $\mathcal{X}_t$ that appeared in the first $T$ rounds, $K$ is the maximum cardinality of any feasible action over all rounds, and $\lambda^*(K)$ is the maximum eigenvalue of all covariance matrices of selected actions up to time $T$, which is a function of $K$. To dramatically speed up the algorithm, we also propose a variant of O'CLOK-UCB that uses sparse GPs. Finally, we experimentally show that both algorithms exploit inter-base arm outcome correlation and vastly outperform the previous state-of-the-art UCB-based algorithms in realistic setups.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through interaction with their environment and has been increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, including autonomous driving. Despite its promise, RL is susceptible to attacks designed either to compromise policy learning or to induce erroneous decisions by trained agents. Although the literature on RL security has grown rapidly and several surveys exist, existing categorizations often fall short in guiding the selection of appropriate defenses for specific systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of 86 recent studies on RL security, addressing these limitations by systematically categorizing attacks and defenses according to defined threat models and single- versus multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we examine the relevance and applicability of state-of-the-art attacks and defense mechanisms within the context of autonomous driving, providing insights to inform the design of robust RL systems.

<title>Towards the Identifiability in Noisy Label Learning: A Multinomial Mixture Modelling Approach</title>

Abstract: Learning from noisy labels (LNL) is crucial in deep learning, in which one of the approaches is to identify clean-label samples from poorly-annotated datasets. Such an identification is challenging because the conventional LNL problem, which assumes only one noisy label per instance, is non-identifiable, i.e., clean labels cannot be estimated theoretically without additional heuristics. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach that addresses this issue without requiring any heuristics about clean samples. We discover that the LNL problem becomes identifiable if there are at least $2C - 1$ i.i.d. noisy labels per instance, where $C$ is the number of classes. Our finding relies on the assumption of i.i.d. noisy labels and multinomial mixture modelling, making it easier to interpret than previous studies that require full-rank noisy-label transition matrices. To fulfil this condition without additional manual annotations, we propose a method that automatically generates additional i.i.d. noisy labels through nearest neighbours. These noisy labels are then used in the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to infer clean labels. Our method demonstrably estimates clean labels accurately across various label noise benchmarks, including synthetic, web-controlled, and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the model trained with our method performs competitively with many state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: To raise awareness of the environmental impact of deep learning (DL), many studies estimate the energy use of DL systems. However, energy estimates during DL training often rely on unverified assumptions. This work addresses that gap by investigating how model architecture and training environment affect energy consumption. We train a variety of computer vision models and collect energy consumption and accuracy metrics to analyze their trade-offs across configurations. Our results show that selecting the right model-training environment combination can reduce training energy consumption by up to 80.68% with less than 2% loss in $F_1$ score. We find a significant interaction effect between model and training environment: energy efficiency improves when GPU computational power scales with model complexity. Moreover, we demonstrate that common estimation practices, such as using FLOPs or GPU TDP, fail to capture these dynamics and can lead to substantial errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Stable Training Epoch Projection (STEP) and the Pre-training Regression-based Estimation (PRE) methods. Across evaluations, our methods outperform existing tools by a factor of two or more in estimation accuracy.

Abstract: Sampling from Boltzmann distributions, particularly those tied to high dimensional and complex energy functions, poses a significant challenge in many fields. In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator (EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and diffusion models. EDG uses a decoder to generate Boltzmann-distributed samples from simple latent variables, and a diffusion-based encoder to estimate the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution. Notably, EDG is simulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints such as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG across a variety of sampling tasks with complex target distributions, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We show that several major algorithms of reinforcement learning (RL) fit into the framework of categorical cybernetics, that is to say, parametrised bidirectional processes. We build on our previous work in which we show that value iteration can be represented by precomposition with a certain optic. The outline of the main construction in this paper is: (1) We extend the Bellman operators to parametrised optics that apply to action-value functions and depend on a sample. (2) We apply a representable contravariant functor, obtaining a parametrised function that applies the Bellman iteration. (3) This parametrised function becomes the backward pass of another parametrised optic that represents the model, which interacts with an environment via an agent. Thus, parametrised optics appear in two different ways in our construction, with one becoming part of the other. As we show, many of the major classes of algorithms in RL can be seen as different extremal cases of this general setup: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal difference learning, and deep RL. We see this as strong evidence that this approach is a natural one and believe that it will be a fruitful way to think about RL in the future.

Abstract: This paper introduces Least Volume (LV)--a simple yet effective regularization method inspired by geometric intuition--that reduces the number of latent dimensions required by an autoencoder without prior knowledge of the dataset's intrinsic dimensionality. We show that its effectiveness depends on the Lipschitz continuity of the decoder, prove that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear special case, and demonstrate that LV induces a PCA-like importance ordering in nonlinear models. We extend LV to non-Euclidean settings as Generalized Least Volume (GLV), enabling the integration of label information into the latent representation. To support implementation, we also develop an accompanying Dynamic Pruning algorithm. We evaluate LV on several benchmark problems, demonstrating its effectiveness in dimension reduction. Leveraging this, we reveal the role of low-dimensional latent spaces in data sampling and disentangled representation, and use them to probe the varying topological complexity of various datasets. GLV is further applied to labeled datasets, where it induces a contrastive learning effect in representations of discrete labels. On a continuous-label airfoil dataset, it produces representations that lead to smooth changes in aerodynamic performance, thereby stabilizing downstream optimization.

Abstract: Desirable random graph models (RGMs) should (i) reproduce common patterns in real-world graphs (e.g., power-law degrees, small diameters, and high clustering), (ii) generate variable (i.e., not overly similar) graphs, and (iii) remain tractable to compute and control graph statistics. A common class of RGMs (e.g., Erdos-Renyi and stochastic Kronecker) outputs edge probabilities, so we need to realize (i.e., sample from) the output edge probabilities to generate graphs. Typically, the existence of each edge is assumed to be determined independently, for simplicity and tractability. However, with edge independency, RGMs provably cannot produce high subgraph densities and high output variability simultaneously. In this work, we explore RGMs beyond edge independence that can better reproduce common patterns while maintaining high tractability and variability. Theoretically, we propose an edge-dependent realization (i.e., sampling) framework called binding that provably preserves output variability, and derive closed-form tractability results on subgraph (e.g., triangle) densities. Practically, we propose algorithms for graph generation with binding and parameter fitting of binding. Our empirical results demonstrate that RGMs with binding exhibit high tractability and well reproduce common patterns, significantly improving upon edge-independent RGMs.

Abstract: Adaptive inference schemes reduce the cost of machine learning inference by assigning smaller models to easier examples, attempting to avoid invocation of larger models when possible. In this work we explore a simple, effective adaptive inference technique we term Agreement-Based Cascading (ABC). ABC builds a cascade of models of increasing size/complexity, and uses agreement between ensembles of models at each level of the cascade as a basis for data-dependent routing. Although ensemble execution introduces additional expense, we show that these costs can be easily offset in practice due to large expected differences in model sizes, parallel inference execution capabilities, and accuracy benefits of ensembling. We examine ABC theoretically and empirically in terms of these parameters, showing that the approach can reliably act as a drop-in replacement for existing models and surpass the best single model it aims to replace in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we explore the performance of ABC relative to existing cascading methods in three common scenarios: (1) edge-to-cloud inference, where ABC reduces communication costs by up to 14x; (2) cloud-based model serving, where it achieves a 3x reduction in rental costs; and (3) inference via model API services, where ABC achieves a 2-25x reduction in average price per token/request relative to state-of-the-art LLM cascades.

Abstract: Scientific discovery catalyzes human intellectual advances, driven by the cycle of hypothesis generation, experimental design, evaluation, and assumption refinement. Central to this process is causal inference, uncovering the mechanisms behind observed phenomena. While randomized experiments provide strong inferences, they are often infeasible due to ethical or practical constraints. However, observational studies are prone to confounding or mediating biases. While crucial, identifying such backdoor paths is expensive and heavily depends on scientists' domain knowledge to generate hypotheses. We introduce a novel benchmark where the objective is to complete a partial causal graph. We design a benchmark with varying difficulty levels with over 4000 queries. We show the strong ability of LLMs to hypothesize the backdoor variables between a cause and its effect. Unlike simple knowledge memorization of fixed associations, our task requires the LLM to reason according to the context of the entire graph.

Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) has a vast literature as it finds numerous real-world applications. Being an unsupervised task, model selection is a key bottleneck for OD without label supervision. Despite a long list of available OD algorithms with tunable hyperparameters, the lack of systematic approaches for unsupervised algorithm and hyperparameter selection limits their effective use in practice. In this paper, we present FoMo-0D, a pre-trained Foundation Model for zero/0-shot OD on tabular data, which bypasses the hurdle of model selection altogether. Having been pre-trained on synthetic data, FoMo-0D can directly predict the (outlier/inlier) label of test samples without parameter fine-tuning -- requiring no labeled data, and no additional training or hyperparameter tuning when given a new task. Extensive experiments on 57 real-world datasets against 26 baselines show that FoMo-0D is highly competitive; outperforming the majority of the baselines with no statistically significant difference from the 2nd best method. Further, FoMo-0D is efficient in inference time requiring only 7.7 ms per sample on average, with at least 7x speed-up compared to previous methods. To facilitate future research, our implementations for data synthesis and pre-training as well as model checkpoints are openly available at https://github.com/A-Chicharito-S/FoMo-0D.

Abstract: Neural network certification methods heavily rely on convex relaxations to provide robustness guarantees. However, these relaxations are often imprecise: even the most accurate single-neuron relaxation is incomplete for general ReLU networks, a limitation known as the \emph{single-neuron convex barrier}. While multi-neuron relaxations have been heuristically applied to address this issue, two central questions arise: (i) whether they overcome the convex barrier, and if not, (ii) whether they offer theoretical capabilities beyond those of single-neuron relaxations. In this work, we present the first rigorous analysis of the expressiveness of multi-neuron relaxations. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that they are inherently incomplete, even when allocated sufficient resources to capture finitely many neurons and layers optimally. This result extends the single-neuron barrier to a \textit{universal convex barrier} for neural network certification. On the positive side, we show that completeness can be achieved by either (i) augmenting the network with a polynomial number of carefully designed ReLU neurons or (ii) partitioning the input domain into convex sub-polytopes, thereby distinguishing multi-neuron relaxations from single-neuron ones which are unable to realize the former and have worse partition complexity for the latter. Our findings establish a foundation for multi-neuron relaxations and point to new directions for certified robustness, including training methods tailored to multi-neuron relaxations and verification methods with multi-neuron relaxations as the main subroutine.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reproduce social biases, yet prevailing evaluations score models in isolation, obscuring how biases persist across families and releases. We introduce Bias Similarity Measurement (BSM), which treats fairness as a relational property between models, unifying scalar, distributional, behavioral, and representational signals into a single similarity space. Evaluating 30 LLMs on 1M+ prompts, we find that instruction tuning primarily enforces abstention rather than altering internal representations; small models gain little accuracy and can become less fair under forced choice; and open-weight models can match or exceed proprietary systems. Family signatures diverge: Gemma favors refusal, LLaMA 3.1 approaches neutrality with fewer refusals, and converges toward abstention-heavy behavior overall. Counterintuitively, Gemma 3 Instruct matches GPT-4-level fairness at far lower cost, whereas Gemini's heavy abstention suppresses utility. Beyond these findings, BSM offers an auditing workflow for procurement, regression testing, and lineage screening, and extends naturally to code and multilingual settings. Our results reframe fairness not as isolated scores but as comparative bias similarity, enabling systematic auditing of LLM ecosystems. Code available at https://github.com/HyejunJeong/bias_llm.

Abstract: Traditional theories of optimization cannot describe the dynamics of optimization in deep learning, even in the simple setting of deterministic training. The challenge is that optimizers typically operate in a complex, oscillatory regime called the "edge of stability." In this paper, we develop theory that can describe the dynamics of optimization in this regime. Our key insight is that while the *exact* trajectory of an oscillatory optimizer may be challenging to analyze, the *time-averaged* (i.e. smoothed) trajectory is often much more tractable. To analyze an optimizer, we derive a differential equation called a "central flow" that characterizes this time-averaged trajectory. We empirically show that these central flows can predict long-term optimization trajectories for generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy. By interpreting these central flows, we are able to understand how gradient descent makes progress even as the loss sometimes goes up; how adaptive optimizers "adapt" to the local loss landscape; and how adaptive optimizers implicitly navigate towards regions where they can take larger steps. Our results suggest that central flows can be a valuable theoretical tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning.

Abstract: Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations. An ablation study highlights the critical role of monotonicity in enhancing performance.

Abstract: We propose the first method to show theoretical limitations for one-layer softmax transformers with arbitrarily many precision bits (even infinite). We establish those limitations for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match 3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all possible token triplets in an input sequence. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: function composition (Peng et al., 2024) and binary relations composition, respectively. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that, equipped with this mechanism, a one-layer transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. Importantly, we show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023), and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.

Abstract: Human language encompasses a wide range of intricate and diverse implicit features, which attackers can exploit to launch adversarial or backdoor attacks, compromising DNN models for NLP tasks. Existing model-oriented defenses often require substantial computational resources as model size increases, whereas sample-oriented defenses typically focus on specific attack vectors or schemes, rendering them vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We observe that the root cause of both adversarial and backdoor attacks lies in the encoding process of DNN models, where subtle textual features, negligible for human comprehension, are erroneously assigned significant weight by less robust or trojaned models. Based on it we propose a unified and adaptive defense framework that is effective against both adversarial and backdoor attacks. Our approach leverages reformulation modules to address potential malicious features in textual inputs while preserving the original semantic integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing sample-oriented defense baselines across a diverse range of malicious textual features.

Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain of the network into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which a network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define an equivalence class $\sim_\Phi$ on top of an input dataset, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the \textit{overlap decomposition} $\mathcal{O}_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and an input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to quotient homology groups $H_k(\Phi(\mathcal{M})) \simeq H_k(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{O}_\Phi)$. This lets us intrinsically calculate the Betti numbers of neural representations without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our overlap homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on several classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.

Abstract: Multi-source transfer learning provides an effective solution to data scarcity in real- world supervised learning scenarios by leveraging multiple source tasks. In this field, existing works typically use all available samples from sources in training, which constrains their training efficiency and may lead to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that answers the question: what is the optimal quantity of source samples needed from each source task to jointly train the target model? Specifically, we introduce a generalization error measure based on K-L divergence, and minimize it based on high-dimensional statistical analysis to determine the optimal transfer quantity for each source task. Additionally, we develop an architecture-agnostic and data-efficient algorithm OTQMS to implement our theoretical results for target model training in multi- source transfer learning. Experimental studies on diverse architectures and two real-world benchmark datasets show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and data efficiency.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that structured machine learning models such as tree ensembles are vulnerable to privacy attacks targeting their training data. To mitigate these risks, differential privacy (DP) has become a widely adopted countermeasure, as it offers rigorous privacy protection. In this paper, we introduce a reconstruction attack targeting state-of-the-art $\epsilon$-DP random forests. By leveraging a constraint programming model that incorporates knowledge of the forest's structure and DP mechanism characteristics, our approach formally reconstructs the most likely dataset that could have produced a given forest. Through extensive computational experiments, we examine the interplay between model utility, privacy guarantees and reconstruction accuracy across various configurations. Our results reveal that random forests trained with meaningful DP guarantees can still leak portions of their training data. Specifically, while DP reduces the success of reconstruction attacks, the only forests fully robust to our attack exhibit predictive performance no better than a constant classifier. Building on these insights, we also provide practical recommendations for the construction of DP random forests that are more resilient to reconstruction attacks while maintaining a non-trivial predictive performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models are one of the key architectures of generative AI. Their main drawback, however, is the computational costs. This study indicates that the concept of sparsity, well known especially in statistics, can provide a pathway to more efficient diffusion pipelines. Our mathematical guarantees prove that sparsity can reduce the input dimension's influence on the computational complexity to that of a much smaller intrinsic dimension of the data. Our empirical findings confirm that inducing sparsity can indeed lead to better samples at a lower cost.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity, stemming from local non-IID data and global long-tailed distributions, is a major challenge in federated learning (FL), leading to significant performance gaps compared to centralized learning. Previous research found that poor representations and biased classifiers are the main problems and proposed neural-collapse-inspired synthetic simplex ETF to help representations be closer to neural collapse optima. However, we find that the neural-collapse-inspired methods are not strong enough to reach neural collapse and still have huge gaps to centralized training. In this paper, we rethink this issue from a self-bootstrap perspective and propose FedYoYo (You Are Your Own Best Teacher), introducing Augmented Self-bootstrap Distillation (ASD) to improve representation learning by distilling knowledge between weakly and strongly augmented local samples, without needing extra datasets or models. We further introduce Distribution-aware Logit Adjustment (DLA) to balance the self-bootstrap process and correct biased feature representations. FedYoYo nearly eliminates the performance gap, achieving centralized-level performance even under mixed heterogeneity. It enhances local representation learning, reducing model drift and improving convergence, with feature prototypes closer to neural collapse optimality. Extensive experiments show FedYoYo achieves state-of-the-art results, even surpassing centralized logit adjustment methods by 5.4\% under global long-tailed settings.

Abstract: The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. However, while this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient~optimization.

Abstract: Accurate crop-type classification from satellite time series is essential for agricultural monitoring. While various machine learning algorithms have been developed to enhance performance on data-scarce tasks, their evaluation often lacks real-world scenarios. Consequently, their efficacy in challenging practical applications has not yet been profoundly assessed. To facilitate future research in this domain, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating supervised and SSL methods for crop-type classification under real-world conditions. This benchmark study relies on the EuroCropsML time-series dataset, which combines farmer-reported crop data with Sentinel-2 satellite observations from Estonia, Latvia, and Portugal. Our findings indicate that MAML-based meta-learning algorithms achieve slightly higher accuracy compared to supervised transfer learning and SSL methods. However, compared to simpler transfer learning, the improvement of meta-learning comes at the cost of increased computational demands and training time. Moreover, supervised methods benefit most when pre-trained and fine-tuned on geographically close regions. In addition, while SSL generally lags behind meta-learning, it demonstrates advantages over training from scratch, particularly in capturing fine-grained features essential for real-world crop-type classification, and also surpasses standard transfer learning. This highlights its practical value when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce. Our insights underscore the trade-offs between accuracy and computational demand in selecting supervised machine learning methods for real-world crop-type classification tasks and highlight the difficulties of knowledge transfer across diverse geographic regions. Furthermore, they demonstrate the practical value of SSL approaches when labeled pre-training crop data is scarce.

Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training. Our code, data, and models are released at https://github.com/mukhal/thinkprm.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit. In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave among the functionalities of language models.

Abstract: Gas turbine engines are complex and highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging because it requires performance characteristics that are not always available, often leading to many simplifying assumptions. This paper discusses the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models, and addresses these issues by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics are estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics is mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. This process involves eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model is validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator are then designed within the eigenfunction space and compared to traditional and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure enables targeting individual modes during optimization, leading to improved performance tuning. Results demonstrate that the Koopman-based controller surpasses other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have made great progress in the field of text-to-speech (TTS), but they still face major challenges in synthesizing fine-grained emotional speech in an interpretable manner. Traditional methods rely on discrete emotion labels to control emotion categories and intensities, which cannot capture the complexity and continuity of human emotional perception and expression. The lack of large-scale emotional speech datasets with balanced emotion distributions and fine-grained emotional annotations often causes overfitting in synthesis models and impedes effective emotion control. To address these issues, we propose UDDETTS, a universal LLM framework unifying discrete and dimensional emotions for controllable emotional TTS. This model introduces the interpretable Arousal-Dominance-Valence (ADV) space for dimensional emotion description and supports emotion control driven by either discrete emotion labels or nonlinearly quantified ADV values. Furthermore, a semi-supervised training strategy is designed to comprehensively utilize diverse speech datasets with different types of emotional annotations to train the UDDETTS. Experiments show that UDDETTS achieves linear emotion control along three interpretable dimensions, and exhibits superior end-to-end emotional speech synthesis capabilities. Code and demos are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/UDDETTS.

Abstract: While Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has attracted considerable attention in the field of graph self-supervised learning, its performance heavily relies on data augmentations that are expected to generate semantically consistent positive pairs. Existing strategies typically resort to random perturbations or local structure preservation, yet lack explicit control over global structural consistency between augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose Fractal Graph Contrastive Learning (FractalGCL), a theory-driven framework introducing two key innovations: a renormalisation-based augmentation that generates structurally aligned positive views via box coverings; and a fractal-dimension-aware contrastive loss that aligns graph embeddings according to their fractal dimensions, equipping the method with a fallback mechanism guaranteeing a performance lower bound even on non-fractal graphs. While combining the two innovations markedly boosts graph-representation quality, it also adds non-trivial computational overhead. To mitigate the computational overhead of fractal dimension estimation, we derive a one-shot estimator by proving that the dimension discrepancy between original and renormalised graphs converges weakly to a centred Gaussian distribution. This theoretical insight enables a reduction in dimension computation cost by an order of magnitude, cutting overall training time by approximately 61\%. The experiments show that FractalGCL not only delivers state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks but also outperforms traditional and latest baselines on traffic networks by an average margin of about remarkably 4\%. Codes are available at (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FractalGCL-0511/).

Abstract: Time series forecasting faces two important but often overlooked challenges. Firstly, the inherent random noise in the time series labels sets a theoretical lower bound for the forecasting error, which is positively correlated with the entropy of the labels. Secondly, neural networks exhibit a frequency bias when modeling the state-space of time series, that is, the model performs well in learning certain frequency bands but poorly in others, thus restricting the overall forecasting performance. To address the first challenge, we prove a theorem that there exists a unitary transformation that can reduce the marginal entropy of multiple correlated Gaussian processes, thereby providing guidance for reducing the lower bound of forecasting error. Furthermore, experiments confirm that Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) can reduce the entropy in the majority of scenarios. Correspondingly, to alleviate the frequency bias, we jointly introduce supervision in the frequency domain along the temporal dimension through DFT and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). This supervision-side strategy is highly general and can be seamlessly integrated into any supervised learning method. Moreover, we propose a novel loss function named OLMA, which utilizes the frequency domain transformation across both channel and temporal dimensions to enhance forecasting. Finally, the experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OLMA in addressing the above two challenges and the resulting improvement in forecasting accuracy. The results also indicate that the perspectives of entropy and frequency bias provide a new and feasible research direction for time series forecasting. The code is available at: https://github.com/Yuyun1011/OLMA-One-Loss-for-More-Accurate-Time-Series-Forecasting.

Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although many advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3\dots$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks researchers' view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on the Schr\"odingerisation method in quantum simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution mechanism in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement a Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, the $d+1$ dimensional evolving designs in our SKNO consistently outperform other baselines across ten benchmarks of increasing difficulty, ranging from the simple 1D heat equation to the highly nonlinear 3D Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We also validate the resolution-invariance of SKNO on mixing-resolution training and zero-shot super-resolution tasks. In addition, we show the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) on graphs generates node and graph representations (i.e., embeddings) that can be used for downstream tasks such as node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. Graph SSL is particularly useful in scenarios with limited or no labeled data. Existing SSL methods predominantly follow contrastive or generative paradigms, each excelling in different tasks: contrastive methods typically perform well on classification tasks, while generative methods often excel in link prediction. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for graph SSL that integrates the strengths of both approaches. Our framework introduces community-aware node-level contrastive learning, providing more robust and effective positive and negative node pairs generation, alongside graph-level contrastive learning to capture global semantic information. Additionally, we employ a comprehensive augmentation strategy that combines feature masking, node perturbation, and edge perturbation, enabling robust and diverse representation learning. By incorporating these enhancements, our model achieves superior performance across multiple tasks, including node classification, clustering, and link prediction. Evaluations on open benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance lift of 0.23%-2.01% depending on the task and dataset.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is essential for long-term decision-making, particularly when the environment may differ from its specification. However, a significant gap exists in understanding the finite-sample complexity of these methods, as most existing work provides only asymptotic guarantees. This limitation hinders their principled understanding and practical deployment, especially in data-limited scenarios. We close this gap by proposing \textbf{Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI)}, a new algorithm designed for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with transition uncertainty characterized by $\ell_p$-norm and contamination models. Our approach offers three key advantages over previous methods: (1). Weaker Structural Assumptions: RHI only requires the underlying robust MDP to be communicating, a less restrictive condition than the commonly assumed ergodicity or irreducibility; (2). No Prior Knowledge: Our algorithm operates without requiring any prior knowledge of the robust MDP; (3). State-of-the-Art Sample Complexity: To learn an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy, RHI achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias span. This result represents the tightest known bound. Our work hence provides essential theoretical understanding of sample efficiency of robust average reward RL.

Abstract: Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of quantisation formats is large and formats are often chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using variable-length codes. We frame the problem as minimising the KL divergence between original and quantised model outputs under a model size constraint, which can be approximated by minimising the squared quantisation error, a well-studied problem where entropy-constrained quantisers with variable-length codes are optimal. We develop non-linear quantisation curves for block-scaled data across multiple distribution families and observe that these formats, along with sparse outlier formats, consistently outperform fixed-length formats, indicating that they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when applied to large language models.

Abstract: Traditional saliency map methods, popularized in computer vision, highlight individual points (pixels) of the input that contribute the most to the model's output. However, in time-series they offer limited insights as semantically meaningful features are often found in other domains. We introduce Cross-domain Integrated Gradients, a generalization of Integrated Gradients. Our method enables feature attributions on any domain that can be formulated as an invertible, differentiable transformation of the time domain. Crucially, our derivation extends the original Integrated Gradients into the complex domain, enabling frequency-based attributions. We provide the necessary theoretical guarantees, namely, path independence and completeness. Our approach reveals interpretable, problem-specific attributions that time-domain methods cannot capture, on three real-world tasks: wearable sensor heart rate extraction, electroencephalography-based seizure detection, and zero-shot time-series forecasting. We release an open-source Tensorflow/PyTorch library to enable plug-and-play cross-domain explainability for time-series models. These results demonstrate the ability of cross-domain integrated gradients to provide semantically meaningful insights in time-series models that are impossible with traditional time-domain saliency.

Abstract: Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast>1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions. However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored. We introduce Cohort-based Active Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark acquisition strategies. Experiments on multimodal datasets with up to 15 modalities demonstrate that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the acquisition of additional modalities for selected samples compared with methods relying solely on unimodal information, entropy-based guidance, or random selection. We showcase the real-world relevance and scalability of our method by demonstrating its ability to effectively guide the costly acquisition of proteomics data for disease prediction in a large prospective cohort, the UK Biobank (UKBB). Our work provides an effective approach for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level, enabling more effective use of resources in constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding and generation, but their enormous computational and memory requirements hinder deployment. Compression offers a potential solution to mitigate these constraints. However, most existing methods rely on fixed heuristics and thus fail to adapt to runtime memory variations or heterogeneous KV-cache demands arising from diverse user requests. To address these limitations, we propose RAP, an elastic pruning framework driven by reinforcement learning (RL) that dynamically adjusts compression strategies in a runtime-aware manner. Specifically, RAP dynamically tracks the evolving ratio between model parameters and KV-cache across practical execution. Recognizing that FFNs house most parameters, whereas parameter -light attention layers dominate KV-cache formation, the RL agent retains only those components that maximize utility within the current memory budget, conditioned on instantaneous workload and device state. Extensive experiments results demonstrate that RAP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, marking the first time to jointly consider model weights and KV-cache on the fly.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a powerful self-supervised learning framework that performs data augmentation through graph perturbations, with growing applications in the analysis of biological networks such as Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). The artificial perturbations commonly used in GCL, such as node dropping, induce structural changes that can diverge from biological reality. This concern has contributed to a broader trend in graph representation learning toward augmentation-free methods, which view such structural changes as problematic and to be avoided. However, this trend overlooks the fundamental insight that structural changes from biologically meaningful perturbations are not a problem to be avoided but a rich source of information, thereby ignoring the valuable opportunity to leverage data from real biological experiments. Motivated by this insight, we propose SupGCL (Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning), a new GCL method for GRNs that directly incorporates biological perturbations from gene knockdown experiments as supervision. SupGCL is a probabilistic formulation that continuously generalizes conventional GCL, linking artificial augmentations with real perturbations measured in knockdown experiments and using the latter as explicit supervisory signals. To assess effectiveness, we train GRN representations with SupGCL and evaluate their performance on downstream tasks. The evaluation includes both node-level tasks, such as gene function classification, and graph-level tasks on patient-specific GRNs, such as patient survival hazard prediction. Across 13 tasks built from GRN datasets derived from patients with three cancer types, SupGCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>FFT-based Dynamic Subspace Selection for Low-Rank Adaptive Optimization of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Low-rank optimization has emerged as a promising direction in training large language models (LLMs) to improve running time and reduce the memory usage of adaptive optimizers by constraining learning to a lower-dimensional space. Prior work typically projects gradients of linear layers using approaches based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR-decomposition. Applying these techniques individually to each layer in large models is computationally expensive and incurs additional memory costs due to storing the projection matrices. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient and conceptually simple, two-step procedure to approximate SVD/QR-based gradient projections into lower-dimensional spaces by using a predefined orthogonal matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We dynamically select columns from the DCT matrix based on their alignment with the gradient of each layer. The effective projection matrices are obtained via a simple matmul with the DCT matrix in $O(n^3)$ time, followed by a lightweight sorting step to identify the most relevant basis vectors. For large layers, DCT can be computed via Makhoul's $N$-point algorithm based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in $O(n^2 \log(n))$ time. Due to the predefined nature of the orthogonal bases, they are computed once at the start of training. Our numerical experiments on both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual strategy in approximating optimal low-rank projections, obtaining an approach with rank-independent running time that matches the performance of costly SVD/QR-based methods while achieving faster runtime and reduced memory usage by up to $25\%$ across different model sizes.

Abstract: Open-weight large language model (LLM) zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of $2\times$ cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.

Abstract: Trees and the associated shortest-path tree metrics provide a powerful framework for representing hierarchical and combinatorial structures in data. Given an arbitrary metric space, its deviation from a tree metric can be quantified by Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity. Nonetheless, designing algorithms that bridge an arbitrary metric to its closest tree metric is still a vivid subject of interest, as most common approaches are either heuristical and lack guarantees, or perform moderately well. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable optimization framework, coined DeltaZero, that solves this problem. Our method leverages a smooth surrogate for Gromov's $\delta$-hyperbolicity which enables a gradient-based optimization, with a tractable complexity. The corresponding optimization procedure is derived from a problem with better worst case guarantees than existing bounds, and is justified statistically. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art distortion.

Abstract: Competing risks are crucial considerations in survival modelling, particularly in healthcare domains where patients may experience multiple distinct event types. We propose CRISP-NAM (Competing Risks Interpretable Survival Prediction with Neural Additive Models), an interpretable neural additive model for competing risks survival analysis which extends the neural additive architecture to model cause-specific hazards while preserving feature-level interpretability. Each feature contributes independently to risk estimation through dedicated neural networks, allowing for visualization of complex non-linear relationships between covariates and each competing risk. We demonstrate competitive performance on multiple datasets compared to existing approaches.

<title>On the Dynamic Regret of Following the Regularized Leader: Optimism with History Pruning</title>

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However, building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not the "lazy" projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates, allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two when necessary.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings, offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL systems for open-world settings.

Abstract: Transformers excel across a large variety of tasks but remain susceptible to corrupted inputs, since standard self-attention treats all query-key interactions uniformly. Inspired by lateral inhibition in biological neural circuits and building on the recent use by the Differential Transformer's use of two parallel softmax subtraction for noise cancellation, we propose Multihead Differential Gated Self-Attention (M-DGSA) that learns per-head input-dependent gating to dynamically suppress attention noise. Each head splits into excitatory and inhibitory branches whose dual softmax maps are fused by a sigmoid gate predicted from the token embedding, yielding a context-aware contrast enhancement. M-DGSA integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer stacks with minimal computational overhead. We evaluate on both vision and language benchmarks, demonstrating consistent robustness gains over vanilla Transformer, Vision Transformer, and Differential Transformer baselines. Our contributions are (i) a novel input-dependent gating mechanism for self-attention grounded in lateral inhibition, (ii) a principled synthesis of biological contrast-enhancement and self-attention theory, and (iii) comprehensive experiments demonstrating noise resilience and cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: We investigate the finite-time convergence properties of Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation, a cornerstone algorithm in the field of reinforcement learning.
  We are interested in the so-called ``robust'' setting, where the convergence guarantee does not depend on the minimal curvature of the potential function.
  While prior work has established convergence guarantees in this setting, these results typically rely on the assumption that each iterate is projected onto a bounded set, a condition that is both artificial and does not match the current practice.
  In this paper, we challenge the necessity of such an assumption and present a refined analysis of TD learning. For the first time, we show that the simple projection-free variant converges with a rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{||\theta^*||^2_2}{\sqrt{T}})$, even in the presence of Markovian noise. Our analysis reveals a novel self-bounding property of the TD updates and exploits it to guarantee bounded iterates.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computing resources, weight pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve SNNs' efficiency. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot post-training pruning/quantization framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based loss found in OBC with a spike train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to prune or quantize synapses and analytically rescale the rest. Our experiments on models trained with neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) and large static datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet) show state-of-the-art results for one-shot post-training compression methods on SNNs, with single-digit to double-digit accuracy gains compared to OBC. SBC also approaches the accuracy of costly iterative methods, while cutting compression time by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements, or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data, (ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization for unconditional and conditional generative models. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. On standard image benchmarks, our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery. We demonstrate our algorithms with datasets of increasing complexity (MNIST, CelebA and ImageNet-1K) and for generative models of increasing complexity (VAEs and diffusion transformers).

<title>There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept. This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the training loss. As a result, MCBMs yield more interpretable representations, support principled concept-level interventions, and remain consistent with probability-theoretic foundations.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy. Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both: during pre-training, a gradient-surgery projection balances the exploration and diversity gradients, and during fine-tuning, a skill selector exploits the learned diversity by choosing skills suited to downstream tasks. Our approach achieves performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. Through an extensive ablation study, we identify the role of each component and demonstrate that each element in AMPED is contributing to performance. We further provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, with a greedy skill selector, greater skill diversity reduces fine-tuning sample complexity. These results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and generalizable skill learning.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws suggest that the test error of large language models trained online decreases polynomially as the model size and data size increase. However, such scaling can be unsustainable when running out of new data. In this work, we show that data reuse can improve existing scaling laws in linear regression. Specifically, we derive sharp test error bounds on $M$-dimensional linear models trained by multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (multi-pass SGD) on $N$ data with sketched features. Assuming that the data covariance has a power-law spectrum of degree $a$, and that the true parameter follows a prior with an aligned power-law spectrum of degree $b-a$ (with $a > b > 1$), we show that multi-pass SGD achieves a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + L^{(1-b)/a})$, where $L \lesssim N^{a/b}$ is the number of iterations. In the same setting, one-pass SGD only attains a test error of $\Theta(M^{1-b} + N^{(1-b)/a})$ (see e.g., Lin et al., 2024). This suggests an improved scaling law via data reuse (i.e., choosing $L>N$) in data-constrained regimes. Numerical simulations are also provided to verify our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity and supports diverse applications in neuroscience. While EEG foundation models (EFMs) have emerged to address the scalability issues of task-specific models, current approaches still yield clinically uninterpretable and weakly discriminative representations, inefficiently capture global dependencies, and neglect important local neural events. We present CodeBrain, a two-stage EFM designed to fill this gap. In the first stage, we introduce the TFDual-Tokenizer, which decouples heterogeneous temporal and frequency EEG signals into discrete tokens, quadratically expanding the representation space to enhance discriminative power and offering domain-specific interpretability by suggesting potential links to neural events and spectral rhythms. In the second stage, we propose the multi-scale EEGSSM architecture, which combines structured global convolution with sliding window attention to efficiently capture both sparse long-range and local dependencies, reflecting the brain's small-world topology. Pretrained on the largest public EEG corpus, CodeBrain achieves strong generalization across 8 downstream tasks and 10 datasets under distribution shifts, supported by comprehensive ablations, scaling-law analyses, and interpretability evaluations. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in the future version.

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data-stemming from the onerous and costly nature of experimental validation-further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel bilevel optimization approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the model to learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We demonstrate significant performance gains on challenging real-world datasets with substantial covariate shift, supported by t-SNE visualizations highlighting our interpolation method.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models is a significant challenge with their growing integration into critical applications and societal functions. While prior research has primarily focused on jailbreak attacks, less attention has been given to non-adversarial failures that subtly emerge during benign interactions. We introduce secondary risks a novel class of failure modes marked by harmful or misleading behaviors during benign prompts. Unlike adversarial attacks, these risks stem from imperfect generalization and often evade standard safety mechanisms. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce two risk primitives verbose response and speculative advice that capture the core failure patterns. Building on these definitions, we propose SecLens, a black-box, multi-objective search framework that efficiently elicits secondary risk behaviors by optimizing task relevance, risk activation, and linguistic plausibility. To support reproducible evaluation, we release SecRiskBench, a benchmark dataset of 650 prompts covering eight diverse real-world risk categories. Experimental results from extensive evaluations on 16 popular models demonstrate that secondary risks are widespread, transferable across models, and modality independent, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced safety mechanisms to address benign yet harmful LLM behaviors in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.

Abstract: We propose VRAIL (Vectorized Reward-based Attribution for Interpretable Learning), a bi-level framework for value-based reinforcement learning (RL) that learns interpretable weight representations from state features. VRAIL consists of two stages: a deep learning (DL) stage that fits an estimated value function using state features, and an RL stage that uses this to shape learning via potential-based reward transformations. The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior. Our findings suggest that VRAIL serves as a general, model-agnostic framework for reward shaping that enhances both learning and interpretability.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases, results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation, which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied five machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. Overall, our findings show that Random Forest with A2 copula oversampling (theta = 10) achieved the best performance, with improvements of 5.3% in accuracy, 9.5% in precision, 5.7% in recall, 7.6% in F1-score, and 1.1% in AUC compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we statistically validated our results using the McNemar's test. This research represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to very successful, but by no means humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability and the exact convex polytope representations. We show that it results in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and cheaply-computable confidence/reliability measures for both the model inputs and the outputs. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a broad set of synthetic and real-world problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of important La Ni\~na and El Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training - a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction tools.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data distributions degrade model performance and necessitate a middleware layer that adapts FL to distributional shifts. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate 5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing communication and computational overhead.

Abstract: Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition-prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called Co-Learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED produces curricula that improve zero-shot generalization over strong baselines across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the transition-prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that Co-Learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition-prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained MDP. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based RCMDP setting. In addition to the RCMDP setting, the paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

<title>Blending Supervised and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Prefix Sampling</title>

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks, requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation, this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we found critical to train latent-space emulators.

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

<title>Training-Free Stein Diffusion Guidance: Posterior Correction for Sampling Beyond High-Density Regions</title>

Abstract: Training free diffusion guidance provides a flexible way to leverage off-the-shelf classifiers without additional training. Yet, current approaches hinge on posterior approximations via Tweedie's formula, which often yield unreliable guidance, particularly in low-density regions. Stochastic optimal control (SOC), in contrast, provides principled posterior simulation but is prohibitively expensive for fast sampling. In this work, we reconcile the strengths of these paradigms by introducing Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a novel training-free framework grounded in a surrogate SOC objective. We establish a theoretical bound on the value function, demonstrating the necessity of correcting approximate posteriors to faithfully reflect true diffusion dynamics. Leveraging Stein variational inference, SDG identifies the steepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between approximate and true posteriors. By incorporating a principled Stein correction mechanism and a novel running cost functional, SDG enables effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on molecular low-density sampling tasks suggest that SDG consistently surpasses standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential for broader diffusion-based sampling beyond high-density regions.

<title>From Sorting Algorithms to Scalable Kernels: Bayesian Optimization in High-Dimensional Permutation Spaces</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for black-box optimization, but its application to high-dimensional permutation spaces is severely limited by the challenge of defining scalable representations. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on an exhaustive $\Omega(n^2)$ pairwise comparison, inducing a dense representation that is impractical for large-scale permutations. To break this barrier, we introduce a novel framework for generating efficient permutation representations via kernel functions derived from sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from enumeration sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} , which leverages the divide-and-conquer structure of merge sort to produce a compact, $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity with no information loss and effectively capture permutation structure. Our central thesis is that the Merge Kernel performs competitively with the Mallows kernel in low-dimensional settings, but significantly outperforms it in both optimization performance and computational efficiency as the dimension $n$ grows. Extensive evaluations on various permutation optimization benchmarks confirm our hypothesis, demonstrating that the Merge Kernel provides a scalable and more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional permutation spaces, thereby unlocking the potential for tackling previously intractable problems such as large-scale feature ordering and combinatorial neural architecture search.

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The implementation is readily available at: \href{https://github.com/itay1551/ParallelTime}{GitHub}.

Abstract: We propose the State Space Neural Operator (SS-NO), a compact architecture for learning solution operators of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Our formulation extends structured state space models (SSMs) to joint spatiotemporal modeling, introducing two key mechanisms: adaptive damping, which stabilizes learning by localizing receptive fields, and learnable frequency modulation, which enables data-driven spectral selection. These components provide a unified framework for capturing long-range dependencies with parameter efficiency. Theoretically, we establish connections between SSMs and neural operators, proving a universality theorem for convolutional architectures with full field-of-view. Empirically, SS-NO achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse PDE benchmarks-including 1D Burgers' and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows-while using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches. A factorized variant of SS-NO further demonstrates scalable performance on challenging 2D problems. Our results highlight the effectiveness of damping and frequency learning in operator modeling, while showing that lightweight factorization provides a complementary path toward efficient large-scale PDE learning.

<title>GEDAN: Learning the Edit Costs for Graph Edit Distance</title>

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). However, most NN methods assume a unit cost for edit operations -- a restrictive and often unrealistic simplification, since topological and functional distances rarely coincide in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end Graph Neural Network framework for learning the edit costs for GED, at a fine-grained level, aligning topological and task-specific similarity. Our method combines an unsupervised self-organizing mechanism for GED approximation with a Generalized Additive Model that flexibly learns contextualized edit costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach overcomes the limitations of non-end-to-end methods, yielding directly interpretable graph matchings, uncovering meaningful structures in complex graphs, and showing strong applicability to domains such as molecular analysis.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

Abstract: Reparameterization policy gradient (RPG) is promising for improving sample efficiency by leveraging differentiable dynamics. However, a critical barrier is its training instability, where high-variance gradients can destabilize the learning process. To address this, we draw inspiration from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which uses a surrogate objective to enable stable sample reuse in the model-free setting. We first establish a connection between this surrogate objective and RPG, which has been largely unexplored and is non-trivial. Then, we bridge this gap by demonstrating that the reparameterization gradient of a PPO-like surrogate objective can be computed efficiently using backpropagation through time. Based on this key insight, we propose Reparameterization Proximal Policy Optimization (RPO), a stable and sample-efficient RPG-based method. RPO enables stable sample reuse over multiple epochs by employing a policy gradient clipping mechanism tailored for RPG. It is further stabilized by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and remains fully compatible with existing variance reduction methods. We evaluate RPO on a suite of challenging locomotion and manipulation tasks, where experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample efficiency and strong performance.

Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is commonly achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplified this paradigm by establishing a direct mapping between the optimal policy and a reward function, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. However, we argue that the DPO loss function is theoretically misaligned with its own derivation, as it promotes the indefinite maximization of a logits difference, which can lead to training instability and reward hacking. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function derived directly from the RLHF optimality condition. Our proposed loss targets a specific, finite value for the logits difference, which is dictated by the underlying reward, rather than its maximization. We provide a theoretical analysis, including a gradient-based comparison, to demonstrate that our method avoids the large gradients that plague DPO when the probability of dispreferred responses approaches zero. This inherent stability prevents reward hacking and leads to more effective alignment. We validate our approach by fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-7B model, showing significant win-rate improvements over a standard DPO baseline and achieving competitive performance against larger models like Llama-3.1-8B.

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time causal model as the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite the presence of latent subprocesses.

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This training-free method, termed Running Confidence Remasking (RCR), consistently enhances performance and provides further improvements when used with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

Abstract: While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer $\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional optimizers and existing DRO methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. Our code is available at https://github.com/IANNXANG/RuscaRL.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization skills and reasoning skills. By training MoE families that vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing under fixed compute budgets, we disentangle pre-training loss from downstream accuracy. Our results reveal two principles. First, Active FLOPs: models with identical training loss but greater active compute achieve higher reasoning accuracy. Second, Total tokens per parameter (TPP): memorization tasks improve with more parameters, while reasoning tasks benefit from optimal TPP, indicating that reasoning is data-hungry. Neither reinforcement learning post-training (GRPO) nor increased test-time compute alters these trends. We therefore argue that optimal MoE sparsity must be determined jointly by active FLOPs and TPP, revising the classical picture of compute-optimal scaling. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long-horizon rollout of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories. Finally, with only 10 solver steps' worth of augmented stencil data, our approach outperforms traditional ML emulators trained on thousands of trajectories in long-horizon rollout accuracy and stability.

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge: severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness. Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for achieving these gains.

<title>On Entropy Control in LLM-RL Algorithms</title>

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks.

<title>One-Embedding-Fits-All: Efficient Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting by a Model Zoo</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths. ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks. Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

<title>Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs. Neural Operators</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154</link>

Abstract: Developing accurate, data-efficient surrogate models is central to advancing AI for Science. Neural operators (NOs), which approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces using conventional neural architectures, have gained popularity as surrogates for systems driven by partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their reliance on large datasets and limited ability to generalize in low-data regimes hinder their practical utility. We argue that these limitations arise from their global processing of data, which fails to exploit the local, discretized structure of physical systems. To address this, we propose Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) as a principled surrogate modeling paradigm for time-dependent PDEs. GNS leverages message-passing combined with numerical time-stepping schemes to learn PDE dynamics by modeling the instantaneous time derivatives. This design mimics traditional numerical solvers, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts and strong inductive biases that enhance generalization. We rigorously evaluate GNS on four canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D scalar Burgers', (2) 2D coupled Burgers', (3) 2D Allen-Cahn, and (4) 2D nonlinear shallow-water equations, comparing against state-of-the-art NOs including Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Results demonstrate that GNS is markedly more data-efficient, achieving less than 1% relative L2 error using only 3% of available trajectories, and exhibits dramatically reduced error accumulation over time (82.5% lower autoregressive error than FNO, 99.9% lower than DeepONet). To choose the training data, we introduce a PCA combined with KMeans trajectory selection strategy. These findings provide compelling evidence that GNS, with its graph-based locality and solver-inspired design, is the most suitable and scalable surrogate modeling framework for AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network reasoning and generalization; models must decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment), a simple encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction ($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit and probing experiments, we reveal how ALICE progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common human strategies -- early layers place greater emphasis on letter frequencies, while later layers form word-level structures. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods are applicable beyond cryptograms and offer new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task decision-making, tasks not only exhibit diverse observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in their underlying complexities. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in single-task settings, we find that when handling a broad and diverse suite of tasks, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often constrain their sample efficiency. In this work, we address these challenges from two complementary perspectives: the single learning iteration and the overall learning process. First, to mitigate the gradient conflicts, we systematically investigate key architectural designs for extending UniZero. Our investigation identifies a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture as the most effective approach. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that this architecture alleviates gradient conflicts by routing task-specific representations to specialized sub-networks. This finding leads to our proposed model, \textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically allocate model capacity throughout the learning process, we introduce an online Dynamic Parameter Scaling (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge retention and parameter expansion. Evaluations on a diverse set of standard benchmarks (Atari, DMC, Jericho) demonstrate that ScaleZero, utilizing solely online reinforcement learning with one model, performs on par with specialized single-task agents. With the DPS strategy, it remains competitive while using just 71.5% of the environment interactions. These findings underscore the potential of ScaleZero for effective multi-task planning.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. For LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 37.3 for QuIP. \href{https://github.com/42Shawn/Butterflyquant-llm}{Codes} are available.

Abstract: The ongoing intense discussion on rising LLM usage in the scientific peer-review process has recently been mingled by reports of authors using hidden prompt injections to manipulate review scores. Since the existence of such "attacks" - although seen by some commentators as "self-defense" - would have a great impact on the further debate, this paper investigates the practicability and technical success of the described manipulations. Our systematic evaluation uses 1k reviews of 2024 ICLR papers generated by a wide range of LLMs shows two distinct results: I) very simple prompt injections are indeed highly effective, reaching up to 100% acceptance scores. II) LLM reviews are generally biased toward acceptance (>95% in many models). Both results have great impact on the ongoing discussions on LLM usage in peer-review.

Abstract: Matched-pair experimental designs aim to detect treatment effects by pairing participants and comparing within-pair outcome differences. In many situations, the overall effect size across the entire population is small. Then, the focus naturally shifts to identifying and targeting high treatment-effect regions where the intervention is most effective. This paper proposes a matched-pair experimental design that sequentially and actively enrolls patients in high treatment-effect regions. Importantly, we frame the identification of the target region as a classification problem and propose an active learning framework tailored to matched-pair designs. Our design not only reduces the experimental cost of detecting treatment efficacy, but also ensures that the identified regions enclose the entire high-treatment-effect regions. Our theoretical analysis of the framework's label complexity and experiments in practical scenarios demonstrate the efficiency and advantages of the approach.

Abstract: Large language models frequently generate confident but incorrect outputs, requiring formal uncertainty quantification with abstention guarantees. We develop information-lift certificates that compare model probabilities to a skeleton baseline, accumulating evidence into sub-gamma PAC-Bayes bounds valid under heavy-tailed distributions. Across eight datasets, our method achieves 77.2\% coverage at 2\% risk, outperforming recent 2023-2024 baselines by 8.6-15.1 percentage points, while blocking 96\% of critical errors in high-stakes scenarios vs 18-31\% for entropy methods. Limitations include skeleton dependence and frequency-only (not severity-aware) risk control, though performance degrades gracefully under corruption.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

Abstract: Hyper-parameter Tuning (HPT) is a necessary step in machine learning (ML) pipelines but becomes computationally expensive and opaque with larger models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9 percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

Abstract: Domestic violence is commonly viewed as a gendered issue that primarily affects women, which tends to leave male victims largely overlooked. This study presents a novel, data-driven analysis of male domestic violence (MDV) in Bangladesh, highlighting the factors that influence it and addressing the challenges posed by a significant categorical imbalance of 5:1 and limited data availability. We collected data from nine major cities in Bangladesh and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying dynamics. EDA revealed patterns such as the high prevalence of verbal abuse, the influence of financial dependency, and the role of familial and socio-economic factors in MDV. To predict and analyze MDV, we implemented 10 traditional machine learning (ML) models, three deep learning models, and two ensemble models, including stacking and hybrid approaches. We propose a stacking ensemble model with ANN and CatBoost as base classifiers and Logistic Regression as the meta-model, which demonstrated the best performance, achieving $95\%$ accuracy, a $99.29\%$ AUC, and balanced metrics across evaluation criteria. Model-specific feature importance analysis of the base classifiers identified key features influencing their decision-making. Model-agnostic explainable AI techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, provided both local and global insights into the decision-making processes of the proposed model, thereby increasing transparency and interpretability. Statistical validation using paired $t$-tests with 10-fold cross-validation and Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 0.0036$) confirmed the superior performance of our proposed model over alternatives. Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that domestic abuse primarily affects women, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions and support systems for male victims.

Abstract: Timely detection of problematic research is essential for safeguarding scientific integrity. To explore whether social media commentary can serve as an early indicator of potentially problematic articles, this study analysed 3,815 tweets referencing 604 retracted articles and 3,373 tweets referencing 668 comparable non-retracted articles. Tweets critical of the articles were identified through both human annotation and large language models (LLMs). Human annotation revealed that 8.3% of retracted articles were associated with at least one critical tweet prior to retraction, compared to only 1.5% of non-retracted articles, highlighting the potential of tweets as early warning signals of retraction. However, critical tweets identified by LLMs (GPT-4o mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) only partially aligned with human annotation, suggesting that fully automated monitoring of post-publication discourse should be applied with caution. A human-AI collaborative approach may offer a more reliable and scalable alternative, with human expertise helping to filter out tweets critical of issues unrelated to the research integrity of the articles. Overall, this study provides insights into how social media signals, combined with generative AI technologies, may support efforts to strengthen research integrity.

Abstract: Cartesian reverse derivative categories (CRDCs) provide an axiomatic generalization of the reverse derivative, which allows generalized analogues of classic optimization algorithms such as gradient descent to be applied to a broad class of problems. In this paper, we show that generalized gradient descent with respect to a given CRDC induces a hypergraph functor from a hypergraph category of optimization problems to a hypergraph category of dynamical systems. The domain of this functor consists of objective functions that are 1) general in the sense that they are defined with respect to an arbitrary CRDC, and 2) open in that they are decorated spans that can be composed with other such objective functions via variable sharing. The codomain is specified analogously as a category of general and open dynamical systems for the underlying CRDC. We describe how the hypergraph functor induces a distributed optimization algorithm for arbitrary composite problems specified in the domain. To illustrate the kinds of problems our framework can model, we show that parameter sharing models in multitask learning, a prevalent machine learning paradigm, yield a composite optimization problem for a given choice of CRDC. We then apply the gradient descent functor to this composite problem and describe the resulting distributed gradient descent algorithm for training parameter sharing models.

Abstract: We introduce a novel two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for accelerating the training of scientific machine learning applications. The design of the proposed preconditioner is motivated by the nonlinear two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner. The neural network parameters are decomposed into groups (subdomains) with overlapping regions. In addition, the network's feed-forward structure is indirectly imposed through a novel subdomain-wise synchronization strategy and a coarse-level training step. Through a series of numerical experiments, which consider physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed two-level preconditioner significantly speeds up the convergence of the standard (LBFGS) optimizer while also yielding more accurate machine learning models. Moreover, the devised preconditioner is designed to take advantage of model-parallel computations, which can further reduce the training time.

Abstract: Understanding dynamic systems like disease outbreaks, social influence, and information diffusion requires effective modeling of complex networks. Traditional evaluation methods for static networks often fall short when applied to temporal networks. This paper introduces DGSP-GCN (Dynamic Graph Similarity Prediction based on Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning-based framework that integrates graph convolutional networks with dynamic graph signal processing techniques to provide a unified solution for evaluating generative models and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks. DGSP-GCN assesses how well a generated network snapshot matches the expected temporal evolution, incorporating an attention mechanism to improve embedding quality and capture dynamic structural changes. The approach was tested on five real-world datasets: WikiMath, Chickenpox, PedalMe, MontevideoBus, and MetraLa. Results show that DGSP-GCN outperforms baseline methods, such as time series regression and random similarity assignment, achieving the lowest error rates (MSE of 0.0645, MAE of 0.1781, RMSE of 0.2507). These findings highlight DGSP-GCN's effectiveness in evaluating and detecting anomalies in dynamic networks, offering valuable insights for network evolution and anomaly detection research.

Abstract: We study the problem of restricting a Markov equivalence class of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) to only those MAGs that contain certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert or orientation knowledge. Such a restriction of the Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a restricted essential ancestral graph. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present several new sound graphical orientation rules for adding orientation knowledge to an essential ancestral graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008b) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with orientation knowledge. Third, we provide an algorithm for including this orientation knowledge and show that in certain settings the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. Finally, outside of the specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995) to settings which allow for latent confounding.

Abstract: Identifying reaction conditions that are broadly applicable across diverse substrates is a longstanding challenge in chemical and pharmaceutical research. While many methods are available to generate conditions with acceptable performance, a universal approach for reliably discovering effective conditions during reaction exploration is rare. Consequently, current reaction optimization processes are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly, relying heavily on trial-and-error experimentation. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry-related problems, such as molecule design and chemical reasoning tasks. Here, we report the design, implementation and application of Chemma-RC, a text-augmented multimodal LLM to identify effective conditions through task-specific dialogue and condition generation. Chemma-RC learns a unified representation of chemical reactions by aligning multiple modalities-including text corpus, reaction SMILES, and reaction graphs-within a shared embedding module. Performance benchmarking on datasets showed high precision in identifying optimal conditions, with up to 17% improvement over the current state-of-the-art methods. A palladium-catalysed imidazole C-H arylation reaction was investigated experimentally to evaluate the functionalities of the Chemma-RC in practice. Our findings suggest that Chemma-RC holds significant potential to accelerate high-throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce a real-time identification method for discrete-time state-dependent switching systems in both the input--output and state-space domains. In particular, we design a system of adaptive algorithms running in two timescales; a stochastic approximation algorithm implements an online deterministic annealing scheme at a slow timescale and estimates the mode-switching signal, and an recursive identification algorithm runs at a faster timescale and updates the parameters of the local models based on the estimate of the switching signal. We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we address specific challenges that arise in the application of the proposed methodology in identification of more general switching systems. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) extends recognition beyond fixed taxonomies by aligning visual and textual features, as in MDETR, GLIP, or RegionCLIP. While effective, these models require updating all parameters of large vision--language backbones, leading to prohibitive training cost. Recent efficient OVD approaches, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or adapters, reduce trainable parameters but often face challenges in selecting which layers to adapt and in balancing efficiency with accuracy. We propose UniProj-Det, a lightweight modular framework for parameter-efficient OVD. UniProj-Det freezes pretrained backbones and introduces a Universal Projection module with a learnable modality token, enabling unified vision--language adaptation at minimal cost. Applied to MDETR, our framework trains only about ~2-5% of parameters while achieving competitive or superior performance on phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and segmentation. Comprehensive analysis of FLOPs, memory, latency, and ablations demonstrates UniProj-Det as a principled step toward scalable and efficient open-vocabulary detection.

Abstract: The discovery of magnetic materials with high operating temperature ranges and optimized performance is essential for advanced applications. Current data-driven approaches are limited by the lack of accurate, comprehensive, and feature-rich databases. This study aims to address this challenge by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a comprehensive, experiment-based, magnetic materials database named the Northeast Materials Database (NEMAD), which consists of 67,573 magnetic materials entries(www.nemad.org). The database incorporates chemical composition, magnetic phase transition temperatures, structural details, and magnetic properties. Enabled by NEMAD, we trained machine learning models to classify materials and predict transition temperatures. Our classification model achieved an accuracy of 90% in categorizing materials as ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and non-magnetic (NM). The regression models predict Curie (N\'eel) temperature with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.87 (0.83) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 56K (38K). These models identified 25 (13) FM (AFM) candidates with a predicted Curie (N\'eel) temperature above 500K (100K) from the Materials Project. This work shows the feasibility of combining LLMs for automated data extraction and machine learning models to accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.

Abstract: We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.

<title>Scaling Laws for Online Advertisement Retrieval</title>

Abstract: The scaling law is a notable property of neural network models and has significantly propelled the development of large language models. Scaling laws hold great promise in guiding model design and resource allocation. Recent research increasingly shows that scaling laws are not limited to NLP tasks or Transformer architectures; they also apply to domains such as recommendation. However, there is still a lack of literature on scaling law research in online advertisement retrieval systems. This may be because 1) identifying the scaling law for resource cost and online revenue is often expensive in both time and training resources for industrial applications, and 2) varying settings for different systems prevent the scaling law from being applied across various scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight paradigm to identify online scaling laws of retrieval models, incorporating a novel offline metric and an offline simulation algorithm. We prove that under mild assumptions, the correlation between the novel metric and online revenue asymptotically approaches 1 and empirically validates its effectiveness. The simulation algorithm can estimate the machine cost offline. Based on the lightweight paradigm, we can identify online scaling laws for retrieval models almost exclusively through offline experiments, and quickly estimate machine costs and revenues for given model configurations. We further validate the existence of scaling laws across mainstream model architectures (e.g., Transformer, MLP, and DSSM) in our real-world advertising system. With the identified scaling laws, we demonstrate practical applications for ROI-constrained model designing and multi-scenario resource allocation in the online advertising system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study identification and application of online scaling laws for online advertisement retrieval.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its theoretical properties are still not well understood. As with classic neural networks, a common approach to improve these models is to increase their size and depth. However, such strategies may be suboptimal, as several works have shown that adding more layers yields increasingly diminishing returns. More importantly, prior studies have shown that increasing depth may lead to model collapse, i.e., all the tokens converge to a single cluster, undermining the ability of LLMs to generate diverse outputs. Building on differential equation models for the transformer dynamics, we prove that all the tokens in a transformer asymptotically converge to a cluster as depth increases. At the technical level we leverage tools from control theory, including consensus dynamics on manifolds and input-to-state stability (ISS). We then extend our analysis to autoregressive models, exploiting their structure to further generalize the theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Multiple agents are increasingly combined to make decisions with the expectation of achieving complementary performance, where the decisions they make together outperform those made individually. However, knowing how to improve the performance of collaborating agents requires knowing what information and strategies each agent employs. With a focus on human-AI pairings, we contribute a decision-theoretic framework for characterizing the value of information. By defining complementary information, our approach identifies opportunities for agents to better exploit available information in AI-assisted decision workflows. We present a novel explanation technique (ILIV-SHAP) that adapts SHAP explanations to highlight human-complementing information. We validate the effectiveness of ACIV and ILIV-SHAP through a study of human-AI decision-making, and demonstrate the framework on examples from chest X-ray diagnosis and deepfake detection. We find that presenting ILIV-SHAP with AI predictions leads to reliably greater reductions in error over non-AI assisted decisions more than vanilla SHAP.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) may have an important role to play in mental health by facilitating the quantification of verbal expressions used to communicate emotions, feelings and thoughts. While there has been substantial and very promising work in this area, the fundamental limits are uncertain. Here, focusing on depressive symptoms, we outline and evaluate LLM performance on three critical tests. The first test evaluates LLM performance on a novel ground-truth dataset from a large human sample (n=770). This dataset is novel as it contains both standard clinically validated quantifications of depression symptoms and specific verbal descriptions of the thoughts related to each symptom by the same individual. The performance of LLMs on this richly informative data shows an upper bound on the performance in this domain, and allow us to examine the extent to which inference about symptoms generalises. Second, we test to what extent the latent structure in LLMs can capture the clinically observed patterns. We train supervised sparse auto-encoders (sSAE) to predict specific symptoms and symptom patterns within a syndrome. We find that sSAE weights can effectively modify the clinical pattern produced by the model, and thereby capture the latent structure of relevant clinical variation. Third, if LLMs correctly capture and quantify relevant mental states, then these states should respond to changes in emotional states induced by validated emotion induction interventions. We show that this holds in a third experiment with 190 participants. Overall, this work provides foundational insights into the quantification of pathological mental states with LLMs, highlighting hard limits on the requirements of the data underlying LLM-based quantification; but also suggesting LLMs show substantial conceptual alignment.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Dealing with this trade-off is still an open challenge in designing AI systems for creativity. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We show that our score can be used as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments considering a variety of creative tasks, such as poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.

Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations, reducing late-stage clinical failures, and accelerating the development of precision therapies. Current AI models rely on structural or target-based features but fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically relevant predictions. Here, we introduce Madrigal, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug-combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21,842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. Madrigal uses an attention bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference, a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions, and ablations show both modality alignment and multimodality are necessary. It captures transporter-mediated interactions and aligns with head-to-head clinical trial differences for neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and hypoglycemia. In type 2 diabetes and MASH, Madrigal supports polypharmacy decisions and prioritizes resmetirom among safer candidates. Extending to personalization, Madrigal improves patient-level adverse-event prediction in a longitudinal EHR cohort and an independent oncology cohort, and predicts ex vivo efficacy in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models. Madrigal links preclinical multimodal readouts to safety risks of drug combinations and offers a generalizable foundation for safer combination design.

Abstract: We introduce Paralinguistic Speech Captions (ParaSpeechCaps), a large-scale dataset that annotates speech utterances with rich style captions. While rich abstract tags (e.g. guttural, nasal, pained) have been explored in small-scale human-annotated datasets, existing large-scale datasets only cover basic tags (e.g. low-pitched, slow, loud). We combine off-the-shelf text and speech embedders, classifiers and an audio language model to automatically scale rich tag annotations for the first time. ParaSpeechCaps covers a total of 59 style tags, including both speaker-level intrinsic tags and utterance-level situational tags. It consists of 342 hours of human-labelled data (PSC-Base) and 2427 hours of automatically annotated data (PSC-Scaled). We finetune Parler-TTS, an open-source style-prompted TTS model, on ParaSpeechCaps, and achieve improved style consistency (+7.9% Consistency MOS) and speech quality (+15.5% Naturalness MOS) over the best performing baseline that combines existing rich style tag datasets. We ablate several of our dataset design choices to lay the foundation for future work in this space. Our dataset, models and code are released at https://github.com/ajd12342/paraspeechcaps .

Abstract: Modern machine learning produces models that are impossible for users or developers to fully understand -- raising concerns about trust, oversight, safety, and human dignity when they are integrated into software products. Transparency and explainability methods aim to provide some help in understanding models, but it remains challenging for developers to design explanations that are understandable to target users and effective for their purpose. Emerging guidelines and regulations set goals but may not provide effective actionable guidance to developers. In a large-scale experiment with 124 participants, we explored how developers approach providing end-user explanations, including what challenges they face, and to what extent specific policies can guide their actions. We investigated whether and how specific forms of policy guidance help developers design explanations and provide evidence for policy compliance for an ML-powered screening tool for diabetic retinopathy. Participants across the board struggled to produce quality explanations and comply with the provided policies. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the nature and specificity of policy guidance had little effect. We posit that participant noncompliance is in part due to a failure to imagine and anticipate the needs of non-technical stakeholders. Drawing on cognitive process theory and the sociological imagination to contextualize participants' failure, we recommend educational interventions.

Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices (which are made public) and subsequently observe their respective demand (not made public). The demand function of each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that uses semi-parametric least-squares estimation and show that when the sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models are released at Hugging Face and ModelScope.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models</title>

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise confidence scores that represent the model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs. We evaluate CONSIGN against two CP baselines across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.

Abstract: Financial markets pose fundamental challenges for asset return prediction due to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility. Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&amp;D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.

Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nayoung10/MOFFlow-2.

<title>Streaming Flow Policy: Simplifying diffusion/flow-matching policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion$/$flow-matching policies have enabled imitation learning of complex, multi-modal action trajectories. However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length, outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and introducing minimal additional parameters.

Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks (TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic multilayer networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

<title>Generalizing while preserving monotonicity in comparison-based preference learning models</title>

Abstract: If you tell a learning model that you prefer an alternative $a$ over another alternative $b$, then you probably expect the model to be monotone, that is, the valuation of $a$ increases, and that of $b$ decreases. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many widely deployed comparison-based preference learning models, including large language models, fail to have this guarantee. Until now, the only comparison-based preference learning algorithms that were proved to be monotone are the Generalized Bradley-Terry models. Yet, these models are unable to generalize to uncompared data. In this paper, we advance the understanding of the set of models with generalization ability that are monotone. Namely, we propose a new class of Linear Generalized Bradley-Terry models with Diffusion Priors, and identify sufficient conditions on alternatives' embeddings that guarantee monotonicity. Our experiments show that this monotonicity is far from being a general guarantee, and that our new class of generalizing models improves accuracy, especially when the dataset is limited.

Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by moving illicit funds into the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, detection rates remain low because launderers evade oversight, confirmed cases are rare, and institutions see only fragments of the global transaction network. Since access to real transaction data is tightly restricted, synthetic datasets are essential for developing and evaluating detection methods. However, existing datasets fall short: they often neglect partial observability, temporal dynamics, strategic behavior, uncertain labels, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. We introduce AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. AMLGentex enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering systems under conditions that mirror real-world challenges. By releasing multiple country-specific datasets and practical parameter guidance, we aim to empower researchers and practitioners and provide a common foundation for collaboration and progress in combating money laundering.

arXiv:2507.06795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

arXiv:2507.14119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets (original image, instruction, edited image), yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approx. 2.6x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit, an open dataset of 720k high-quality triplets, curated at industrial scale via millions of guided generations and validator passes, and we analyze the pipeline's stage-wise survival rates, providing a framework for estimating computational effort across different model stacks. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, a fine-tuned Bagel model with state-of-the-art metrics.

<title>GeMix: Conditional GAN-Based Mixup for Improved Medical Image Augmentation</title>

arXiv:2507.15577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification, yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms between Banach spaces of functions. They have become an increasingly critical tool for spatiotemporal forecasting and physics emulation, especially in high-stakes scenarios where robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification is required. We introduce Local Sliced Conformal Inference (LSCI), a distribution-free framework for generating function-valued, locally adaptive prediction sets for operator models. We prove finite-sample validity and derive a data-dependent upper bound on the coverage gap under local exchangeability. On synthetic Gaussian-process tasks and real applications (air quality monitoring, energy demand forecasting, and weather prediction), LSCI yields tighter sets with stronger adaptivity compared to conformal baselines. We also empirically demonstrate robustness against biased predictions and certain out-of-distribution noise regimes.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent works have begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, abstract representations of motion between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Vision-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. We demonstrate that villa-X can generate latent action plans in a zero-shot fashion, even for unseen embodiments and open-vocabulary symbolic understanding. This capability enables villa-X to achieve superior performance across diverse simulation tasks in SIMPLER and on two real-world robotic setups involving both gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. These results establish villa-X as a principled and scalable paradigm for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. We believe it provides a strong foundation for future research.

arXiv:2508.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models are increasingly adopted in high-stakes domains, yet current deployments offer no mechanisms to verify whether a given output truly originates from the certified model. We address this gap by extending model fingerprinting techniques beyond the traditional collaborative setting to one where the model provider itself may act adversarially, replacing the certified model with a cheaper or lower-quality substitute. To our knowledge, this is the first work to study fingerprinting for provenance attribution under such a threat model. Our approach introduces a trusted verifier that, during a certification phase, extracts hidden fingerprints from the authentic model's output space and trains a detector to recognize them. During verification, this detector can determine whether new outputs are consistent with the certified model, without requiring specialized hardware or model modifications. In extensive experiments, our methods achieve near-zero FPR@95%TPR on both GANs and diffusion models, and remain effective even against subtle architectural or training changes. Furthermore, the approach is robust to adaptive adversaries that actively manipulate outputs in an attempt to evade detection.

Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

arXiv:2508.17892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated success across many benchmarks. However, they still exhibit limitations in long-context scenarios, primarily due to their short effective context length, quadratic computational complexity, and high memory overhead when processing lengthy inputs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel context compression pipeline, called Intermediate Layer Retrieval (ILRe), which determines one intermediate decoder layer offline, encodes context by streaming chunked prefill only up to that layer, and recalls tokens by the attention scores between the input query and full key cache in that specified layer. In particular, we propose a multi-pooling kernels allocating strategy in the token recalling process to maintain the completeness of semantics. Our approach not only reduces the prefilling complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L)$ and trims the memory footprint to a few tenths of that required for the full context, but also delivers performance comparable to or superior to the full-context setup in long-context scenarios. Without additional post training or operator development, ILRe can process a single $1M$ tokens request in less than half a minute (speedup $\approx 180\times$) and scores RULER-$1M$ benchmark of $\approx 79.8$ with model Llama-3.1-UltraLong-8B-1M-Instruct on a Huawei Ascend 910B NPU.

Abstract: Recent advances in the development of robotic foundation models have led to promising end-to-end and general-purpose capabilities in robotic systems. These models are pretrained on vast datasets of robot trajectories to process multi-modal inputs and directly output a sequence of action that the system then executes in the real world. Although this approach is attractive from the perspective of improved generalization across diverse tasks, these models are still data-driven and, therefore, lack explicit notions of behavioral correctness and safety constraints. We address these limitations by introducing a constrained decoding framework for robotics foundation models that enforces logical constraints on action trajectories in dynamical systems. Our method ensures that generated actions provably satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications at runtime without retraining, while remaining agnostic of the underlying foundation model. We perform comprehensive evaluation of our approach across state-of-the-art navigation foundation models and we show that our decoding-time interventions are useful not only for filtering unsafe actions but also for conditional action-generation.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts. Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge.

Abstract: A key challenge in scientific machine learning is solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex domains, where the curved geometry complicates the approximation of functions and their derivatives required by differential operators. This paper establishes the first simultaneous approximation theory for deep neural networks on manifolds. We prove that a constant-depth $\mathrm{ReLU}^{k-1}$ network with bounded weights--a property that plays a crucial role in controlling generalization error--can approximate any function in the Sobolev space $\mathcal{W}_p^{k}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ to an error of $\varepsilon$ in the $\mathcal{W}_p^{s}(\mathcal{M}^d)$ norm, for $k\geq 3$ and $s<k$, using $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/(k-s)})$ nonzero parameters, a rate that overcomes the curse of dimensionality by depending only on the intrinsic dimension $d$. These results readily extend to functions in H\"older-Zygmund spaces. We complement this result with a matching lower bound, proving our construction is nearly optimal by showing the required number of parameters matches up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof of the lower bound introduces novel estimates for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and pseudo-dimension of the network's high-order derivative classes. These complexity bounds provide a theoretical cornerstone for learning PDEs on manifolds involving derivatives. Our analysis reveals that the network architecture leverages a sparse structure to efficiently exploit the manifold's low-dimensional geometry. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Abstract: Text-guided sound separation supports flexible audio editing across media and assistive applications, but existing models like AudioSep are too compute-heavy for edge deployment. Neural audio codec (NAC) models such as CodecFormer and SDCodec are compute-efficient but limited to fixed-class separation. We introduce CodecSep, the first NAC-based model for on-device universal, text-driven separation. CodecSep combines DAC compression with a Transformer masker modulated by CLAP-derived FiLM parameters. Across six open-domain benchmarks under matched training/prompt protocols, \textbf{CodecSep} surpasses \textbf{AudioSep} in separation fidelity (SI-SDR) while remaining competitive in perceptual quality (ViSQOL) and matching or exceeding fixed-stem baselines (TDANet, CodecFormer, SDCodec). In code-stream deployments, it needs just 1.35~GMACs end-to-end -- approximately $54\times$ less compute ($25\times$ architecture-only) than spectrogram-domain separators like AudioSep -- while remaining fully bitstream-compatible.

Abstract: We study whether 3D self-supervised pretraining with Point--JEPA enables label-efficient grasp joint-angle prediction. Meshes are sampled to point clouds and tokenized; a ShapeNet-pretrained Point--JEPA encoder feeds a $K{=}5$ multi-hypothesis head trained with winner-takes-all and evaluated by top--logit selection. On a multi-finger hand dataset with strict object-level splits, Point--JEPA improves top--logit RMSE and Coverage@15$^{\circ}$ in low-label regimes (e.g., 26% lower RMSE at 25% data) and reaches parity at full supervision, suggesting JEPA-style pretraining is a practical lever for data-efficient grasp learning.

<div> Keywords: brain network data, self-supervised learning, SAM-BG, structural semantics, psychiatric diagnoses 

Summary: 
SAM-BG is a two-stage framework designed to improve the accuracy and interpretability of psychiatric diagnoses by learning brain graph representations with preserved structural semantics. The framework consists of a pre-training stage where an edge masker captures key structural semantics from a small labeled subset, and a self-supervised learning stage where this knowledge guides a structure-aware augmentation process for more meaningful representations. Experiments on real-world psychiatric datasets show that SAM-BG outperforms existing methods, especially in settings with limited labeled data, and reveals clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability. The code for SAM-BG is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The limited availability of labeled brain network data makes it challenging to achieve accurate and interpretable psychiatric diagnoses. While self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising solution, existing methods often rely on augmentation strategies that can disrupt crucial structural semantics in brain graphs. To address this, we propose SAM-BG, a two-stage framework for learning brain graph representations with structural semantic preservation. In the pre-training stage, an edge masker is trained on a small labeled subset to capture key structural semantics. In the SSL stage, the extracted structural priors guide a structure-aware augmentation process, enabling the model to learn more semantically meaningful and robust representations. Experiments on two real-world psychiatric datasets demonstrate that SAM-BG outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in small-labeled data settings, and uncovers clinically relevant connectivity patterns that enhance interpretability.

<div> Keywords: symbolic regression, Monte Carlo Tree Search, bandit allocation, state-jumping actions, numerical study

Summary:
In this study, an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework for symbolic regression is proposed to address limitations in traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction. The key innovations include an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions and evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover. These enhancements lead to improved search efficiency, robustness, and performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions. A thorough numerical study evaluates the impact of these improvements and benchmarks the approach against existing methods on various datasets. The results demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries, achieving a favorable balance between accuracy and model complexity on the Pareto frontier. The code for the proposed approach is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However, its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus model complexity.

Summary:
This paper introduces Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel framework for offline reinforcement learning that incorporates frequency-domain features to address the issue of trajectory instability caused by shifts in low-frequency components. By employing Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories and Short-Time Fourier Transform with cross attention mechanisms to extract and facilitate cross-frequency interaction, WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift and improves decision-making performance. Experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser outperforms existing methods by producing smoother, more stable trajectories. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However, existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother, more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by refining their capabilities.

<br />
Summary: DeepACTIF is a lightweight feature attribution method designed for interpreting deep learning models in time-series domains, particularly suited for real-time applications such as healthcare and human-AI interaction. By leveraging internal activations of LSTM-based networks, DeepACTIF efficiently estimates feature importance using an inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasizes stability and magnitude of activations across time steps. Evaluation on three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction and outperforms established methods like SHAP and IG in terms of accuracy and robustness. Through experiments, DeepACTIF is shown to reduce computation time and memory usage significantly while maintaining model accuracy with only the top-ranked features. This makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models, particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently. Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top 10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods, including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or embedded health monitors.

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns, increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and conventional LSTM models.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of unsupervised outlier detection methods in audit analytics, utilizing USA spending data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as a case example. We employ and compare multiple outlier detection algorithms, including Histogram-based Outlier Score (HBOS), Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify anomalies in federal spending patterns. The research addresses the growing need for efficient and accurate anomaly detection in large-scale governmental datasets, where traditional auditing methods may fall short. Our methodology involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid approach, combining multiple detection strategies, enhances the robustness and accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the comparative effectiveness of various outlier detection models and demonstrating the potential of unsupervised learning techniques in improving audit quality and efficiency. The findings have implications for auditors, policymakers, and researchers seeking to leverage advanced analytics in governmental financial oversight and risk management.

Summary: The article critically evaluates the effectiveness of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in hallucination detection, particularly focusing on their performance on the RAGTruth dataset. It is found that the high performance of SOTA methods is primarily due to a spurious correlation with the data. When this effect is controlled for, SOTA methods do not outperform supervised linear probes, necessitating extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. The analysis also reveals that out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, as all methods studied perform close to random in this regard. The article proposes a set of guidelines for both hallucination detection and its evaluation, highlighting the need for improved methods that can overcome current limitations in detecting and addressing hallucinations effectively. <div>

Out-of-distribution generalization is currently out of reach, with all of the analyzed methods performing close to random. We propose a set of guidelines for hallucination detection and its evaluation.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in expressing uncertainty, particularly in high-stakes domains like clinical diagnostics. Traditional methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities often lead to overconfidence and poor calibration. In this study, the authors propose an approach using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to address these issues. By treating LLMs as stochastic simulators and inferring posterior distributions over predictive probabilities, the ABC approach significantly improves accuracy (up to 46.9%) and reduces Brier scores by 74.4%. The method also enhances calibration, as demonstrated by improvements in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy. Evaluation on synthetic oral lesion diagnosis and a symptom-to-diagnosis dataset further validates the effectiveness of the ABC approach in improving the reliability and performance of LLMs in clinical settings.

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference, based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors focus on addressing temporal failures in RAG systems using two different methods applied to cybersecurity data. The first method involved a simple recency prior, which successfully achieved a high accuracy of 1.00 on freshness tasks. This result indicates the effectiveness of using recency as a factor in addressing temporal failures. However, the second method, which utilized a clustering heuristic for topic evolution, did not perform as well, as it yielded a low F1-score of 0.08. This outcome suggests that detecting trends in cybersecurity data requires more advanced methods beyond simple heuristics. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering different approaches and strategies when dealing with temporal failures in RAG systems, especially in the context of cybersecurity data analysis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

arXiv:2509.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance, requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

Summary: <br />
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is commonly used to enhance Transformers by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices into attention projections. However, existing methods treat these matrices as independent for each layer and projection, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, the authors propose TensLoRA, a unified framework that combines LoRA updates into higher-order tensors, allowing for a wide range of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. This approach offers mode-specific compression rates, enabling customization of parameter budgets based on modality and task. Experimental results on vision and language tasks demonstrate that the tensor construction significantly impacts performance, sometimes outperforming standard LoRA with similar parameter counts. TensLoRA provides a more versatile and efficient way to adapt Transformers, yielding improved results in various scenarios. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA under similar parameter counts.

<div> adaptive patch embedding, temporal heterogeneity, segment-wise decoding, multivariate time series forecasting, TimeMosaic

Summary:

The article introduces TimeMosaic, a novel framework for multivariate time series forecasting that addresses the issue of temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic utilizes adaptive patch embedding to adjust granularity based on local information density, balancing motif reuse and structural clarity while maintaining temporal continuity. It also implements segment-wise decoding, treating each prediction horizon as a separate subtask to adapt to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements. Through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, TimeMosaic outperforms existing methods and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art TSFMs when trained on a large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations. The framework's innovative approach to capturing the diverse complexities of short-term and long-term forecasting horizons makes it a promising tool for various domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance, transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

Summary:<br />
This study compares three techniques, SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, for credit default prediction, addressing the class imbalance issue. ML models were evaluated on imbalanced data to establish baseline performance before resampling. Ensemble boosting algorithms like XGBoost, AdaBoost, GBM, and Light GBM were tested with Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection. The Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier showed the best performance (F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in credit default prediction. This study lays the groundwork for enhancing credit default systems adaptability in the rising global credit market. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques, namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models (F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

Summary:
- The study examines uncertainty quantification in statistical and deep learning models for electricity price forecasting in the German market.
- Models include deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) augmented with ensemble methods and conformal prediction, as well as LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) models with various techniques.
- LEAR-based models show strong performance in probabilistic forecasting regardless of the uncertainty quantification method used.
- DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, leading to improvements in point and probabilistic forecasting.
- Models using conformal prediction demonstrate the best capture of uncertainty.
Summary:<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management, and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

<div> sensitivity, distributional shifts, verification methodology, risk assessment, deep learning systems
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel methodology for evaluating and assessing the risks of deep learning systems, which are often sensitive to minor shifts in input data known as distributional shifts. These shifts, common in real-world scenarios, are not typically considered during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. The proposed approach estimates the probability of distributional shifts at runtime using out-of-distribution detectors and combines this with network correctness probabilities in a binary tree structure for accurate accuracy estimation. Tested on five datasets with varying distributional shift frequencies, the approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation methods with small estimation errors. In a medical segmentation benchmark, the approach demonstrates potential for risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses. This approach aims to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

Summary:<br />
- Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) is used to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs) on large-scale time series datasets.<br />
- Current benchmarking practices for CFTL lack accuracy due to various factors like small-scale evaluation datasets and overlap risks.<br />

- Evaluation on 15 diverse public forecast competition datasets shows statistical models outperform existing FFMs significantly in sCRPS and MASE metrics.<br />
- Synthetic dataset pre-training shows a 7% improvement in FFM accuracy, highlighting the potential benefits of utilizing synthetic data in the pre-training process.<br /> 
<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Summary:<br /><br /> This study introduces a novel approach, THINNs, for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems. By using a physically informed penalization strategy based on a large deviations principle, improbable deviations are penalized, leading to a thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs. Analytical a posteriori estimates are provided, and empirical comparisons with established penalization strategies are conducted to validate the efficacy of THINNs. This new approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of PINNs in modeling complex systems with fluctuating behavior. <div>
arXiv:2509.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems, we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established penalization strategies.

<div> scalability, transformer modeling, multivariate time series, delegate tokens, noise-resilience<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces DELTAformer, a new method for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data to address scalability and performance issues. DELTAformer utilizes delegate tokens to constrain inter-variable mixing, improving signal focus and noise-resilience. The method scales linearly with variable count, outperforming standard transformers and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks. By strategically incorporating domain-specific challenges, DELTAformer demonstrates superior performance in noisy MTS environments, showcasing improved noise-resilience compared to standard transformers. The model's selective information propagation enhances signal relevance and overall effectiveness in MTS data analysis. Through effective constraint of inter-variable modeling, DELTAformer simultaneously improves scalability and performance, highlighting the potential for domain-specific design considerations to enhance transformer models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention (DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science applications.

Summary:
The study introduces a frame-based diffusion paradigm for molecular generation that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance. Three variants are investigated: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD). By incorporating EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the QM9 dataset. The results demonstrate high validity and uniqueness, with faster sampling compared to other methods. This approach maintains atom stability of 98.98% and molecular stability of 90.51%, outperforming equivariant baselines. The study highlights the importance of global structure preservation in molecular generation and establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm. <div>

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of global structure preservation.

<br />
Summary: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) introduces a new method for learning dissipative dynamics without violating first principles. Unlike neural surrogates that can destabilize long-horizon rollouts, MCFM incorporates a conservative-dissipative split into the vector field and a structure preserving sampler. By training via conditional flow matching on short transitions, MCFM avoids the need for long rollout adjoints. During inference, a Strang-prox scheme ensures discrete energy decay through alternating symplectic updates and proximal metric steps. Additionally, an optional projection can enforce strict decay when trusted energy information is available. Continuous and discrete time guarantees connect MCFM's parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts. In experiments on a mechanical benchmark, MCFM produces phase portraits closer to ground truth and exhibits fewer instances of energy increase and positive energy rate events compared to unconstrained neural flows, while maintaining a comparable fit to the terminal distribution. <div>

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Summary:<br /><br />Diffusion-based world models have shown promise in generating realistic trajectories for offline RL but struggle with action generation. The proposed DAWM model addresses this limitation by incorporating actions into the trajectory generation process alongside states and rewards. This allows for compatibility with one-step TD-based offline RL algorithms. DAWM utilizes an inverse dynamics model for efficient action inference, leading to complete synthetic transitions that benefit conservative offline RL algorithms like TD3BC and IQL. Empirical results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of DAWM, with improved performance over existing diffusion-based baselines across various tasks. This modular design enhances training efficiency and enables better utilization of generated trajectories for offline RL algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2509.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference (TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training. Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories, consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work, and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules' input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

<div> Machine Learning, Antibody Design, Reformatting Success, Protein Language Models, Predictive Accuracy
Summary:
Machine learning is used to predict the success of reformatting antibodies from one format to another. The framework considers sequence, structure, and realistic deployment scenarios. Surprisingly, large pretrained protein language models do not outperform simple, domain-tailored representations, especially in challenging scenarios with new antibodies. The best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, allowing for the prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple, domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario, our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new approach, von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss, for deep hashing in time series data indexing. The proposed method aims to reduce information loss by mapping data to a hyperspherical space and modeling each data class with distinct vMF distributions. This allows for better separation between semantically different data samples, improving search and retrieval efficiency. The vMF hashing loss outperforms existing baselines in experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating compact binary representations for time series data. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available to facilitate further research and application in time series data mining. <div>

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes, but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jmpq97/vmf-hashing

<div> spectrum scaling, state-space models, attention mechanism, Transformer models, language modeling<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of the Mamba architecture in handling long-context inputs, attributing it to the out-of-distribution behavior of its state-space dynamics and the structure of its state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike previous explanations focusing on the accumulation of discretization time steps, the authors link the model's sensitivity to context length extension to the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. To address this issue, they propose a spectrum scaling approach to selectively modulate the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer of pre-trained Mamba models. This technique demonstrates significant improvements in long-context generalization performance, providing a new perspective on enhancing state-space models for better handling of extended context lengths.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension. Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition matrices.

Summary:<br />
Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a challenging task due to scarcity of real data and temporal dependencies. The proposed TIMED framework integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a supervisor network for autoregressive dependencies, and a Wasserstein critic for temporal smoothness. It also includes a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss for feature space alignment. All components are optimized for sequence modeling and trained jointly to capture unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results show that TIMED outperforms state-of-the-art models in generating realistic and coherent sequences across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection, where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.

<div> Keywords: Global Station Weather Forecasting, spatial correlation, attention mechanism, multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting, performance improvement<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel approach called Spatial Structured Attention Block for global station weather forecasting. This method addresses the limitation of existing time series forecasting methods by incorporating spatial correlation modeling. It partitions the spatial graph into subgraphs and utilizes both Intra-subgraph Attention and Inter-subgraph Attention to learn and represent local spatial correlation while considering global correlation. By expanding subgraph scales, a scalable and structured multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model is developed. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 16.8% improvement in performance compared to baseline methods, with low running costs. This approach enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of global weather forecasting for various sectors such as energy, aviation, and agriculture.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.

<div> Keywords: time series, digital health, self-supervised learning, data distribution shift, deep learning

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful patterns from noisy time series data in digital health using self-supervised learning. The proposed framework incorporates a bag-of-symbol representation to account for data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors. This representation is advantageous as it is insensitive to data warping, location shifts, and noise. By being aware of these factors, the deep learning model can better generalize across significant data shifts. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in scenarios where data shifting is substantial. The study highlights the importance of considering data distribution shift in deep learning models for time series data analysis in digital health applications. <div>
arXiv:2509.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better performance where significant data shifting exists.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel approach for distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) focusing on numerical data. The method utilizes wavelet expansions to express sample distributions, with a priority on estimating low-order coefficients for accurate macroscopic level estimation. By preventing probability mass from being misplaced far away from the true distribution, the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods under Wasserstein and KS distances. The theoretical guarantees of the method are also established. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the wavelet expansion method in accurately estimating distributions while preserving privacy under LDP. <div>

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein and KS distances.

<div> Keywords: Chest X-Rays, healthcare datasets, machine learning models, clinical context, pre-test probability

Summary: 
Machine learning models for Chest X-Ray (CXR) diagnosis, evaluated using prior discharge summaries to assess contextual knowledge available to clinicians, show better performance on cases with low pre-test probabilities compared to higher ones. The use of pre-test probability also helps distinguish true diagnostic signal from shortcut inference abilities, as evidenced by performance drops in a balanced test set without the shortcut. This analysis method, utilizing clinical context from discharge summaries, offers a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation approach for evaluating clinical vision models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a ``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs. Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis, using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

<div> Keywords: Federated continual learning, prompt-based methods, class-wise knowledge coherence, C${}^2$Prompt, task data<br />
Summary:<br />
Federated continual learning (FCL) deals with learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients. Existing prompt-based FCL methods face challenges related to class-wise knowledge coherence, leading to intra-class distribution gaps and inter-prompt class-wise relevance issues. To tackle these issues, the Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method is proposed. It includes a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) to reduce intra-class distribution disparities and a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) to enhance class-relevant knowledge aggregation during prompt communication. By explicitly addressing class-wise coherence, C${}^2$Prompt outperforms existing methods in FCL benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The source code for C${}^2$Prompt is publicly available for further research and applications. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts, intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<div> Adam, continual learning, trainability, optimization, ReLU <br />
Summary:
The article investigates the issue of Loss of Trainability (LoT) in continual learning and analyzes it through an optimization perspective. Traditional indicators like Hessian rank, sharpness level, and gradient norms are found to be unreliable predictors of LoT in Adam optimization. Instead, the study introduces two new criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that together form a per-layer predictive threshold. By using this threshold, a simple per-layer scheduler is developed to maintain effective step sizes within safe limits, thereby stabilizing training and enhancing accuracy across various methods including CReLU and regularization techniques. The learned learning-rate trajectories generated by this approach mirror standard decay patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling the trainability issue in continual learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2509.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios, and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit, stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU), Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Summary: 
The study focuses on training a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks without providing the model with normal equations or handcrafted iterations. The model learns to predict missing blocks, including scalar targets and unseen kernel slices for Nyström extrapolation, through input-output pairs and mean-squared loss. Surprisingly, the model uncovers a parameter-free update rule through algebraic unrolling, demonstrating second-order convergence on full-batch problems and reducing complexity in distributed iterations. The model remains accurate even with rank-limited attention and adapts to different computational regimes. This research showcases the capability of in-context learning, where a transformer trained for patching missing blocks implicitly discovers a unified iterative solver for various tasks like prediction, estimation, and Nyström extrapolation. <div>

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss; it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation). We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a powerful capability of in-context learning.

Summary:
Surgical decision-making in complex procedures like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction requires accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs). Traditional statistical methods struggle with heterogeneous data, leading to limited accuracy. In this study, a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, is developed to model surgical decisions as distinct tasks while learning shared representations. The framework incorporates inverse probability weighting (IPW) to enhance causal validity. Evaluation on spinal fusion and scoliosis datasets demonstrates superior performance in estimating treatment effects and predicting patient-reported outcomes. The model achieves high AUC values, outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation, and provides robust patient-specific causal estimates. X-MultiTask has the potential to advance personalized surgical care, improve patient outcomes, and is available for use on GitHub.

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision (e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs. posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset (368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs. non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ (0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains, with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902. By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient outcomes.

Summary:  
This research introduces a novel method for noninvasively predicting arterial blood pressure (ABP) using speech signals. The traditional cuff-based methods for ABP monitoring can yield inconsistent results, but by leveraging the acoustic characteristics of speech and employing advanced deep learning techniques, this study successfully captures voice features to establish correlations with blood pressure levels. The model, based on BERT regression, achieved impressive performance metrics with mean absolute errors of 1.36 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 1.24 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The robustness of the model was demonstrated by high R-scores of 0.99 and 0.94 for SBP and DBP, respectively. The analysis of training and validation loss also indicated effective learning with minimal overfitting. This approach not only provides an accurate and user-friendly method for blood pressure assessment but also holds significant implications for enhancing patient care and proactive management of cardiovascular health.

<div> Frictional Q-learning, static friction, extrapolation error, off-policy RL, continuous control<br />
<br />
Summary: Frictional Q-learning is introduced as a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control tasks. Drawing an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and extrapolation error in off-policy RL, the algorithm incorporates a constraint to prevent the policy from drifting towards unsupported actions. By constraining the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to that in the replay buffer while maintaining a distance from the orthonormal action space manifold, the algorithm effectively addresses extrapolation error. This constraint, inspired by the concept of friction, simplifies the batch-constrained reinforcement learning approach and offers a physical interpretation of the error. Empirically, Frictional Q-learning demonstrates robust training and competitive performance on standard continuous control benchmarks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard continuous control benchmarks.

Summary:  
Sobolev training, a technique incorporating target derivatives in loss functions, has been proven to speed up convergence and enhance generalization in comparison to standard $L^2$ training. However, the precise mechanisms behind this method were not fully understood. This study establishes a theoretical framework demonstrating that Sobolev training quickens convergence in Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Using a student-teacher setup with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, the research provides exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, illustrating improved conditioning of the loss landscape and faster convergence rates via gradient flow. Extensive experiments confirm these theoretical results and demonstrate that the advantages of Sobolev training are applicable to contemporary deep learning tasks. <div>

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep learning tasks.

arXiv:2509.19774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis. Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges, including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than 118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world cardiovascular screening.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel approach called Tanbr for efficient online inference in Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) models. Tanbr addresses the challenges of large model size and complex expert routing by estimating task distribution from historical data. It utilizes a binary tree to generate candidate merging weights, applying neural bandit to determine optimal expert merging. Tanbr achieves a sublinear regret bound of O(sqrt(T) log(T)) over T rounds, matching existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate Tanbr's effectiveness in reducing inference latency by 45% and memory usage by up to 25%, while maintaining high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Tanbr's task-aware expert merging capability enhances online inference efficiency and reliability, making it a promising solution for real-time applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing, especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that \texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$}, while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
- Human drivers focus on a few agents at a time, while autonomous systems handle complex scenes with multiple agents.
- Existing attention mechanisms for agent interactions are computationally expensive due to their quadratic nature.
- RDAR proposes a strategy to learn per-agent relevance by identifying which agents impact the controlled vehicle's behavior.
- RDAR formulates the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process, where actions determine agent exclusion.
- Evaluation on a large driving dataset shows RDAR's ability to accurately measure relevance while processing fewer agents than state-of-the-art models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents, regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.

<div> Keywords: Policy-based reinforcement learning, mathematical reasoning tasks, rollout-based reinforcement learning, difficulty levels, curriculum reinforcement learning.

Summary: 
Policy-based reinforcement learning techniques are vital for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based methods do not consider LLMs' learning ability across samples of varying difficulty levels. A new framework called VCRL is proposed, which adjusts the sample difficulty based on the variance of group rewards in reinforcement learning. Samples with moderate difficulty exhibit higher variance, indicating their suitability for training. Experimental results on multiple mathematical benchmarks and models demonstrate the superiority of VCRL over current LLM RL approaches. This approach aligns with the human cognitive process of solving mathematical problems starting from easy to difficult ones, enhancing the performance of LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels, which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter (CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate $O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a structured alternative to existing methods.

<div> Keywords: boreal forests, carbon sequestration, permafrost preservation, reinforcement learning, multi-objective optimization

Summary:<br />
1. The study focuses on boreal forests, which store a significant amount of terrestrial carbon and are crucial for climate mitigation due to their vulnerability to permafrost thaw.
2. The researchers introduce BoreaRL, a multi-objective reinforcement learning environment designed for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, incorporating a simulator of energy, carbon, and water fluxes.
3. Carbon objectives are found to be easier to optimize compared to thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, highlighting the complexity of balancing these competing goals.
4. Different management strategies emerge from the analysis, with carbon-focused policies favoring high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies prioritize species composition and density to protect permafrost while maximizing carbon gains.
5. The study underscores the challenges in developing robust climate-adaptive forest management strategies using current multi-objective reinforcement learning methods, underscoring the need for further research in this area.<br />

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation. However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms: site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings, standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate applications.

<div> transformer-based models, symbolic regression, generalization, pre-training data, out-of-distribution challenges 

Summary: 
- Symbolic regression algorithms use Transformer-based models to search for mathematical expressions that fit given data, reducing the need for expensive combinatorial searches. 
- The success of these models depends heavily on their pre-training data, with their ability to generalize to new problems largely unexplored. 
- A systematic study was conducted to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained transformer-based symbolic regression models, showing a significant gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. 
- While these models perform well within their pre-training data, their performance degrades in scenarios outside this distribution, limiting their practical applications in real-world problems. 
- The findings suggest that addressing this generalization gap is crucial to enhance the usability of pre-trained approaches for broader applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.19849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a method to address the challenge of unbalanced classification tasks in machine learning by distinguishing critical instances near the decision boundary from redundant samples in the core of the data distribution. The proposed boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score significantly on benchmark datasets, while the core-aware reduction method compresses datasets without sacrificing accuracy. This has implications for efficient model training, especially in computationally demanding domains like Large Language Model (LLM) training. The approach prioritizes decision-relevant data, leading to faster convergence, improved generalization, and substantial computational savings. The method can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to intelligent sampling for data-efficient learning and driving advancements in AI technologies. The code for the method is available as a Python package for easy implementation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\% on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements.

It introduces zeroth-step Hamiltonians as informative descriptors and initial estimates for the regression model to predict correction terms to target Hamiltonians. The neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry is used for prediction, along with a novel training objective to ensure accuracy in both real and reciprocal space.

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

arXiv:2509.19884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm. Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry. We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets. In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines, particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems: human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME 24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5), surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future open-source models. The implementation is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/PromptCoT.

<title>Pure Exploration via Frank-Wolfe Self-Play</title>

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy, yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free, tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm, bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

<title>Latent Iterative Refinement Flow: A Geometric-Constrained Approach for Few-Shot Generation</title>

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling. Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss} $L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle, candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem} demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

<title>On the Fragility of Contribution Score Computation in Federated Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical need for more robust evaluation schemes.

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap, we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20 examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii) Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript, and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use multimodal construction to improve interpretability.

<title>TABFAIRGDT: A Fast Fair Tabular Data Generator using Autoregressive Decision Trees</title>

arXiv:2509.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models, achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably, TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU, making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

arXiv:2509.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover, it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems, and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum harmonic oscillator.

<title>Learnable Sampler Distillation for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/feiyangfu/LSD}{https://github.com/feiyangfu/LSD}.

<title>From Samples to Scenarios: A New Paradigm for Probabilistic Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.

<title>Faster Than SVD, Smarter Than SGD: The OPLoRA Alternating Update</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine (LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

<title>RAD: Towards Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Multi-modal Clinical Diagnosis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters, neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover, recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code is available at https://github.com/tdlhl/RAD.

<title>Pi-Transformer: A Physics-informed Attention Mechanism for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

<title>Learning Robust Penetration-Testing Policies under Partial Observability: A systematic evaluation</title>

arXiv:2509.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size, aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go beyond quantitative results.

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset, achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a strong foundation for class separability.

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework, \textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM, LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second, we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks. Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization, capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

arXiv:2509.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks, including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and imputing partially observed dynamics.

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making. However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks. Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50 samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

We provide a novel algorithm whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition, and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained} optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood. In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution. We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between embedding organization and semantic patterns.

<title>Generative Model Inversion Through the Lens of the Manifold Hypothesis</title>

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process, yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

<title>An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity</title>

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process. The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset, FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline models to a considerable extent.

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold. We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular, but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets, highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical experiments.

<title>Q-Palette: Fractional-Bit Quantizers Toward Optimal Bit Allocation for Efficient LLM Deployment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Q-Palette.

<title>Beyond Sharp Minima: Robust LLM Unlearning via Feedback-Guided Multi-Point Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20230</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HGMamba-ncRNA-94D0.

<title>Energy Use of AI Inference: Efficiency Pathways and Test-Time Compute</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200 billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8 GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day, similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains during the internet and cloud build-up.

<title>Dynamic Lagging for Time-Series Forecasting in E-Commerce Finance: Mitigating Information Loss with A Hybrid ML Architecture</title>

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5% reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method. Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results across representative material systems, including two phase composites and single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary, xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/judgment-to-noise-947D/README.md

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as $\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks, where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered. Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified, generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.

<title>Feature Dynamics as Implicit Data Augmentation: A Depth-Decomposed View on Deep Neural Network Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20334</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones. This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability. Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates for measuring temporal feature evolution.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these reasoning process mechanisms in a fundamental and unified view, we set the basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization, which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise. Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of \textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of \textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common neonatal anomaly, highlighting the urgent need for early detection to improve outcomes. Yet, fetal ECG (fECG) signals in abdominal ECG (aECG) are often masked by maternal ECG and noise, challenging conventional methods under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. We propose FetalHealthNet (FHNet), a deep learning framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks with a multi-scale enhanced transformer to dynamically model spatiotemporal inter-lead correlations and extract clean fECG signals. On benchmark aECG datasets, FHNet consistently outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM) models, standard transformers, and state-of-the-art models, achieving R2>0.99 and RMSE = 0.015 even under severe noise. Interpretability analyses highlight physiologically meaningful temporal and lead contributions, supporting model transparency and clinical trust. FHNet illustrates the potential of AI-driven modeling to advance fetal monitoring and enable early CHD screening, underscoring the transformative impact of next-generation biomedical signal processing.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises high spectral efficiency but also leads to high-dimensional downlink channel state information (CSI), which complicates real-time channel acquisition and precoding. To address this, we propose an end-to-end (E2E) uplink-downlink CSI fusion precoding network that jointly models downlink CSI reference signal (CSI-RS) design, CSI feedback, and base-station (BS) precoding within a single E2E neural architecture. Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.

Abstract: As the consumption of traditional energy sources intensifies and their adverse environmental impacts become more pronounced, wave energy stands out as a highly promising member of the renewable energy family due to its high energy density, stability, widespread distribution, and environmental friendliness. The key to its development lies in the precise prediction of Significant Wave Height (WVHT). However, wave energy signals exhibit strong nonlinearity, abrupt changes, multi-scale periodicity, data sparsity, and high-frequency noise interference; additionally, physical models for wave energy prediction incur extremely high computational costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model combining STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM. This model exploits the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess (STL), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technologies. The model aims to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, capture extreme wave heights, and address issues related to high-frequency noise and periodic signals, thereby achieving efficient and accurate prediction of significant wave height. Experiments were conducted using hourly data from NOAA Station 41008 and 41047 spanning 2019 to 2022. The results showed that compared with other single models and hybrid models, the STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM model achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy in capturing extreme wave heights and suppressing high-frequency noise, with MAE reduced by 15.8\%-40.5\%, SMAPE reduced by 8.3\%-20.3\%, and R increased by 1.31\%-2.9\%; in ablation experiments, the model also demonstrated the indispensability of each component step, validating its superiority in multi-scale feature fusion.

Abstract: Pediatric arrhythmias are a major risk factor for disability and sudden cardiac death, yet their automated classification remains challenging due to class imbalance, few-shot categories, and complex signal characteristics, which severely limit the efficiency and reliability of early screening and clinical intervention. To address this problem, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning framework that combines dual-branch convolutional encoders for ECG and IEGM, semantic attention for cross-modal feature alignment, and a lightweight Transformer encoder for global dependency modeling. In addition, we introduce a new contrastive loss fucntion named Adaptive Global Class-Aware Contrastive Loss (AGCACL) to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class separability through class prototypes and a global similarity matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study based on the Leipzig Heart Center pediatric/congenital ECG+IEGM dataset, for which we also provide a complete and reproducible preprocessing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the overall best performance on this dataset, including 97.76\% Top-1 Accuracy, 94.08\% Macro Precision, 91.97\% Macro Recall, 92.97\% Macro F1, and 92.36\% Macro F2, with improvements of +13.64, +15.96, +19.82, and +19.44 percentage points over the strongest baseline in Macro Precision/Recall/F1/F2, respectively. These findings indicate that the framework significantly improves the detectability and robustness for minority arrhythmia classes, offering potential clinical value for rhythm screening, pre-procedural assessment, and postoperative follow-up in pediatric and congenital heart disease populations.

Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.

Abstract: Human activity recognition is critical for applications such as early intervention and health analytics. Traditional activity recognition relies on inertial measurement units (IMUs), which are resource intensive and require calibration. Although electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods have been explored, these have typically served as supplements to IMUs or have been limited to broad categorical classification such as fall detection or active vs. inactive in daily activities. In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be further improved by increasing the training population. This study demonstrates the first successful ECG-only activity classification in multiple physical activities, offering significant potential for developing next-generation wearables capable of simultaneous cardiac monitoring and activity recognition without additional motion sensors.

Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks.

Abstract: Complex-valued signals encode both amplitude and phase, yet most deep models treat attention as real-valued correlation, overlooking interference effects. We introduce the Holographic Transformer, a physics-inspired architecture that incorporates wave interference principles into self-attention. Holographic attention modulates interactions by relative phase and coherently superimposes values, ensuring consistency between amplitude and phase. A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/EonHao/Holographic-Transformers.

Abstract: To address the issue of limited channels and insufficient information collection in portable EEG devices, this study explores an EEG virtual channel signal generation network using a novel spatio-temporal feature fusion strategy. Based on the EEG signals from four frontal lobe channels, the network aims to generate virtual channel EEG signals for other 13 important brain regions. The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification. This study effectively alleviates the problem of insufficient information acquisition by portable EEG devices with few channels.

Abstract: 6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness, LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation. This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework in localization and channel modeling.

Abstract: We introduce ShinkaEvolve: a new open-source framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to advance scientific discovery with state-of-the-art performance and unprecedented efficiency. Recent advances in scaling inference time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions. However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension. ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse computational problems.

Abstract: The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) is known to be involved in olfactory learning and memory; the synaptic plasticity of the Kenyon cell (KC) to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) synapses plays a key role in the learning process. Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

<title>LLM-Assisted Topic Reduction for BERTopic on Social Media Data</title>

Abstract: The BERTopic framework leverages transformer embeddings and hierarchical clustering to extract latent topics from unstructured text corpora. While effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling. However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead, limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases, coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial parameter selection.

Abstract: We present a sensor-fusion framework for rapid, non-destructive classification and quality control of organic substances, built on a standard Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller platform equipped with three commercial environmental and gas sensors. All data used in this study were generated in-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired samples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and cardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup, resulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was employed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised learning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were trained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing models, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test accuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that low-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with advanced machine learning and correlation-driven feature engineering, enable reliable identification and quality control of organic compounds.

Abstract: This study presents the development and optimization of a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict short-term hourly electricity demand in C\'ordoba, Argentina. Integrating historical consumption data with exogenous variables (climatic factors, temporal cycles, and demographic statistics), the model achieved high predictive precision, with a mean absolute percentage error of 3.20\% and a determination coefficient of 0.95. The inclusion of periodic temporal encodings and weather variables proved crucial to capture seasonal patterns and extreme consumption events, enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition to the design and hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM architecture, two complementary analyses were carried out: (i) an interpretability study using Random Forest regression to quantify the relative importance of exogenous drivers, and (ii) an evaluation of model performance in predicting the timing of daily demand maxima and minima, achieving exact-hour accuracy in more than two-thirds of the test days and within abs(1) hour in over 90\% of cases. Together, these results highlight both the predictive accuracy and operational relevance of the proposed framework, providing valuable insights for grid operators seeking optimized planning and control strategies under diverse demand scenarios.

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain, dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

Abstract: Passive intermodulation (PIM) has emerged as a critical source of self-interference in modern MIMO-OFDM systems, especially under the stringent requirements of 5G and beyond. Conventional cancellation methods often rely on complex nonlinear models with limited scalability and high computational cost. In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for PIM cancellation that leverages depthwise separable convolutions and dilated convolutions to efficiently capture nonlinear dependencies across antennas and subcarriers. To further enhance convergence, we adopt a cyclic learning rate schedule and gradient clipping. In a controlled MIMO experimental setup, the method effectively suppresses third-order passive intermodulation (PIM) distortion, achieving up to 29dB of average power error (APE) with only 11k trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of compact neural architectures for scalable interference mitigation in future wireless communication systems.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution regional significant wave height fields from sparse and uneven buoy observations remains a core challenge for ocean monitoring and risk-aware operations. We introduce AUWave, a hybrid deep learning framework that fuses a station-wise sequence encoder (MLP) with a multi-scale U-Net enhanced by a bottleneck self-attention layer to recover 32$\times$32 regional SWH fields. A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design. AUWave provides a scalable pathway for gap filling, high-resolution priors for data assimilation, and contingency reconstruction.

Abstract: Effective control of neural interfaces is limited by poor signal quality. While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification, (2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.

Abstract: Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) are the electroencephalographic hallmark of absence epilepsy, yet their manual identification in multi-day recordings remains labour-intensive and error-prone. We present a lightweight hybrid pipeline that couples analytical features with a shallow artificial neural network (ANN) for accurate, patient-specific SWD detection in long-term, monopolar EEG. A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the high-frequency components of normal background activity. The residual signal is then summarised by the mean and the standard deviation of its normally distributed samples, yielding a compact, two-dimensional feature vector for every 20s window. These features are fed to a single-hidden-layer ANN trained via back-propagation to classify each window as SWD or non-SWD. The method was evaluated on 780 channels sampled at 256 Hz from 12 patients, comprising 392 annotated SWD events. It correctly detected 384 events (sensitivity: 98%) while achieving a specificity of 96.2 % and an overall accuracy of 97.2%. Because feature extraction is analytic, and the classifier is small, the pipeline runs in real-time and requires no manual threshold tuning. These results indicate that normal-distribution descriptors combined with a modest ANN provide an effective and computationally inexpensive solution for automated SWD screening in extended EEG recordings.

<title>Self-Alignment Learning to Improve Myocardial Infarction Detection from Single-Lead ECG</title>

Abstract: Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be publicly available after acceptance.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.

Abstract: Individual differences in brain activity hinder the online application of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain computer interface (BCI) systems. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.

In this paper, we propose ChatIYP, a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to query IYP through natural language questions. Our evaluation demonstrates solid performance on simple queries, as well as directions for improvement, and provides insights for selecting evaluation metrics that are better fit for IYP querying AI agents.

Abstract: Classifying hadronic jets using their constituents' kinematic information is a critical task in modern high-energy collider physics. Often, classifiers are designed by targeting the best performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, or rejection rates. However, the use of a single metric can lead to the use of architectures that are more model-dependent than competitive alternatives, leading to potential uncertainty and bias in analysis. We explore such trade-offs and demonstrate the consequences of using networks with high performance metrics but low resilience.

Abstract: Search and rescue operations require unmanned aerial vehicles to both traverse unknown unstructured environments at high speed and track targets once detected. Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global localization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation have shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible detected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field of view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking. Outdoor experiments in dense forests, container compounds, and search-and-rescue operations with vehicles and mannequins demonstrate robust autonomy where global methods fail.

Abstract: We test the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) in astronomy by measuring representational convergence across a range of foundation models trained on different data types. Using spectroscopic and imaging observations from JWST, HSC, Legacy Survey, and DESI, we compare representations from vision transformers, self-supervised models, and astronomy-specific architectures via mutual $k$-nearest neighbour analysis. We observe consistent scaling: representational alignment generally increases with model capacity across our tested architectures, supporting convergence toward a shared representation of galaxy astrophysics. Our results suggest that astronomical foundation models can use pre-trained general-purpose architectures, allowing us to capitalise on the broader machine learning community's already-spent computational investment.

Abstract: Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning requires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and scene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

Abstract: Standard first-order Langevin algorithms such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA) are obtained by discretizing the Langevin diffusion and are widely used for sampling in machine learning because they scale to high dimensions and large datasets. However, they face two key limitations: (i) they require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions. The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions. The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/Jasper-aaa/SEIL.git.

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme -- in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

Abstract: In this short note, we study the impact of data augmentation on the smoothness of principal components of high-dimensional datasets. Using tools from quantum harmonic analysis, we show that eigenfunctions of operators corresponding to augmented data sets lie in the modulation space $M^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, guaranteeing smoothness and continuity. Numerical examples on synthetic and audio data confirm the theoretical findings. While interesting in itself, the results suggest that manifold learning and feature extraction algorithms can benefit from systematic and informed augmentation principles.

<title>OmniVLA: An Omni-Modal Vision-Language-Action Model for Robot Navigation</title>

Abstract: Humans can flexibly interpret and compose different goal specifications, such as language instructions, spatial coordinates, or visual references, when navigating to a destination. In contrast, most existing robotic navigation policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric, semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities, and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe OmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation policies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation models. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its checkpoints and training code on our project page.

<title>AIRwaves at CheckThat! 2025: Retrieving Scientific Sources for Implicit Claims on Social Media with Dual Encoders and Neural Re-Ranking</title>

Abstract: Linking implicit scientific claims made on social media to their original publications is crucial for evidence-based fact-checking and scholarly discourse, yet it is hindered by lexical sparsity, very short queries, and domain-specific language. Team AIRwaves ranked second in Subtask 4b of the CLEF-2025 CheckThat! Lab with an evidence-retrieval approach that markedly outperforms the competition baseline. The optimized sparse-retrieval baseline(BM25) achieves MRR@5 = 0.5025 on the gold label blind test set. To surpass this baseline, a two-stage retrieval pipeline is introduced: (i) a first stage that uses a dual encoder based on E5-large, fine-tuned using in-batch and mined hard negatives and enhanced through chunked tokenization and rich document metadata; and (ii) a neural re-ranking stage using a SciBERT cross-encoder. Replacing purely lexical matching with neural representations lifts performance to MRR@5 = 0.6174, and the complete pipeline further improves to MRR@5 = 0.6828. The findings demonstrate that coupling dense retrieval with neural re-rankers delivers a powerful and efficient solution for tweet-to-study matching and provides a practical blueprint for future evidence-retrieval pipelines.

<title>Cognitive Load Limits in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Multi-Hop Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic, information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

<title>AnySafe: Adapting Latent Safety Filters at Runtime via Safety Constraint Parameterization in the Latent Space</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19555</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that foundational safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, can be applied in the latent space of world models. While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: This research aims to explore the intersection of Large Language Models and confidence calibration in Entity Matching. To this end, we perform an empirical study to compare baseline RoBERTa confidences for an Entity Matching task against confidences that are calibrated using Temperature Scaling, Monte Carlo Dropout and Ensembles. We use the Abt-Buy, DBLP-ACM, iTunes-Amazon and Company datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed modified RoBERTa model exhibits a slight overconfidence, with Expected Calibration Error scores ranging from 0.0043 to 0.0552 across datasets. We find that this overconfidence can be mitigated using Temperature Scaling, reducing Expected Calibration Error scores by up to 23.83%.

arXiv:2509.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Stochastic Correlated Obstacle Scene (SCOS) problem, a navigation setting with spatially correlated obstacles of uncertain blockage status, realistically constrained sensors that provide noisy readings and costly disambiguation. Modeling the spatial correlation with Gaussian Random Field (GRF), we develop Bayesian belief updates that refine blockage probabilities, and use the posteriors to reduce search space for efficiency. To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across varying obstacle densities, sensor capabilities demonstrate consistent performance gains over baselines. This framework addresses navigation challenges in environments with adversarial interruptions or clustered natural hazards.

Abstract: Pixel-based language models aim to solve the vocabulary bottleneck problem in language modeling, but the challenge of uncertainty quantification remains open. The novelty of this work consists of analysing uncertainty and confidence in pixel-based language models across 18 languages and 7 scripts, all part of 3 semantically challenging tasks. This is achieved through several methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout, Transformer Attention, and Ensemble Learning. The results suggest that pixel-based models underestimate uncertainty when reconstructing patches. The uncertainty is also influenced by the script, with Latin languages displaying lower uncertainty. The findings on ensemble learning show better performance when applying hyperparameter tuning during the named entity recognition and question-answering tasks across 16 languages.

Abstract: Time series analysis has emerged as an important tool for improving patient diagnosis and management in healthcare applications. However, these applications commonly face two critical challenges: time misalignment and data sparsity. Traditional approaches address these issues through a two-step process of imputation followed by prediction. We propose MAGIC (Multi-tAsk Gaussian Process for Imputation and Classification), a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs class-informed missing value imputation and label prediction within a hierarchical multi-task Gaussian process coupled with functional logistic regression. To handle intractable likelihood components, MAGIC employs Taylor expansion approximations with bounded error analysis, and parameter estimation is performed using EM algorithm with block coordinate optimization supported by convergence analysis. We validate MAGIC through two healthcare applications: prediction of post-traumatic headache improvement following mild traumatic brain injury and prediction of in-hospital mortality within 48 hours after ICU admission. In both applications, MAGIC achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods. The ability to generate real-time and accurate predictions with limited samples facilitates early clinical assessment and treatment planning, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed treatment decisions.

Abstract: Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down. Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation. This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set of compounds.

<title>What Does Your Benchmark Really Measure? A Framework for Robust Inference of AI Capabilities</title>

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance? Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations. After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together, these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate space weather forecasting is crucial for protecting our increasingly digital infrastructure. Hybrid-Vlasov models, like Vlasiator, offer physical realism beyond that of current operational systems, but are too computationally expensive for real-time use. We introduce a graph-based neural emulator trained on Vlasiator data to autoregressively predict near-Earth space conditions driven by an upstream solar wind. We show how to achieve both fast deterministic forecasts and, by using a generative model, produce ensembles to capture forecast uncertainty. This work demonstrates that machine learning offers a way to add uncertainty quantification capability to existing space weather prediction systems, and make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for operational use.

Abstract: Egocentric human experience data presents a vast resource for scaling up end-to-end imitation learning for robotic manipulation. However, significant domain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between human and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a unified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces between human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of discrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal Transport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align between the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant information critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant absolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented cross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual manipulation tasks. EgoBridge also generalizes to new objects, scenes, and tasks seen only in human data, where baselines fail entirely. Videos and additional information can be found at https://ego-bridge.github.io

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments. Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust, scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation hyperspectral missions.

Abstract: Online classification is a central problem in optimization, statistical learning and data science. Classical algorithms such as the perceptron offer efficient updates and finite mistake guarantees on linearly separable data, but they do not exploit the underlying geometric structure of the classification problem. We study the offline maximum margin problem through its dual formulation and use the resulting geometric insights to design a principled and efficient algorithm for the online setting. A key feature of our method is its translation invariance, inherited from the offline formulation, which plays a central role in its performance analysis. Our theoretical analysis yields improved mistake and margin bounds that depend only on translation-invariant quantities, offering stronger guarantees than existing algorithms under the same assumptions in favorable settings. In particular, we identify a parameter regime where our algorithm makes at most two mistakes per sequence, whereas the perceptron can be forced to make arbitrarily many mistakes. Our numerical study on real data further demonstrates that our method matches the computational efficiency of existing online algorithms, while significantly outperforming them in accuracy.

Abstract: We propose a framework that enables neural models to "think while listening" to everyday sounds, thereby enhancing audio classification performance. Motivated by recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, we address two central questions: (i) how can thinking be incorporated into existing audio classification pipelines to enable reasoning in the category space and improve performance, and (ii) can a new architecture be designed from the ground up to support both thinking and test-time scaling? We demonstrate that in both settings, our models exhibit improved classification accuracy. Leveraging test-time scaling, we observe consistent gains as the number of sampled traces increases. Furthermore, we evaluate two open-source reasoning models, GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-14B, showing that while such models are capable of zero-shot reasoning, a lightweight approach--retraining only the embedding matrix of a frozen, smaller model like GPT-2--can surpass the performance of billion-parameter text-based reasoning models.

Abstract: We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).

Abstract: Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30 success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.

Abstract: Copulas are a fundamental tool for modelling multivariate dependencies in data, forming the method of choice in diverse fields and applications. However, the adoption of existing models for multimodal and high-dimensional dependencies is hindered by restrictive assumptions and poor scaling. In this work, we present methods for modelling copulas based on the principles of diffusions and flows. We design two processes that progressively forget inter-variable dependencies while leaving dimension-wise distributions unaffected, provably defining valid copulas at all times. We show how to obtain copula models by learning to remember the forgotten dependencies from each process, theoretically recovering the true copula at optimality. The first instantiation of our framework focuses on direct density estimation, while the second specialises in expedient sampling. Empirically, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed methods over state-of-the-art copula approaches in modelling complex and high-dimensional dependencies from scientific datasets and images. Our work enhances the representational power of copula models, empowering applications and paving the way for their adoption on larger scales and more challenging domains.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive real-world evaluation of AI-assisted software development tools deployed at enterprise scale. Over one year, 300 engineers across multiple teams integrated an in-house AI platform (DeputyDev) that combines code generation and automated review capabilities into their daily workflows. Through rigorous cohort analysis, our study demonstrates statistically significant productivity improvements, including an overall 31.8% reduction in PR review cycle time.
  Developer adoption was strong, with 85% satisfaction for code review features and 93% expressing a desire to continue using the platform. Adoption patterns showed systematic scaling from 4% engagement in month 1 to 83% peak usage by month 6, stabilizing at 60% active engagement. Top adopters achieved a 61% increase in code volume pushed to production, contributing to approximately 30 to 40% of code shipped to production through this tool, accounting for an overall 28% increase in code shipment volume.
  Unlike controlled benchmark evaluations, our longitudinal analysis provides empirical evidence from production environments, revealing both the transformative potential and practical deployment challenges of integrating AI into enterprise software development workflows.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions. Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

<title>Convex Regression with a Penalty</title>

Abstract: A common way to estimate an unknown convex regression function $f_0: \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ from a set of $n$ noisy observations is to fit a convex function that minimizes the sum of squared errors. However, this estimator is known for its tendency to overfit near the boundary of $\Omega$, posing significant challenges in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a new estimator of $f_0$ that avoids this overfitting by minimizing a penalty on the subgradient while enforcing an upper bound $s_n$ on the sum of squared errors. The key advantage of this method is that $s_n$ can be directly estimated from the data. We establish the uniform almost sure consistency of the proposed estimator and its subgradient over $\Omega$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and derive convergence rates. The effectiveness of our estimator is illustrated through its application to estimating waiting times in a single-server queue.

<title>High-Dimensional Statistical Process Control via Manifold Fitting and Learning</title>

Abstract: We address the Statistical Process Control (SPC) of high-dimensional, dynamic industrial processes from two complementary perspectives: manifold fitting and manifold learning, both of which assume data lies on an underlying nonlinear, lower dimensional space. We propose two distinct monitoring frameworks for online or 'phase II' Statistical Process Control (SPC). The first method leverages state-of-the-art techniques in manifold fitting to accurately approximate the manifold where the data resides within the ambient high-dimensional space. It then monitors deviations from this manifold using a novel scalar distribution-free control chart. In contrast, the second method adopts a more traditional approach, akin to those used in linear dimensionality reduction SPC techniques, by first embedding the data into a lower-dimensional space before monitoring the embedded observations. We prove how both methods provide a controllable Type I error probability, after which they are contrasted for their corresponding fault detection ability. Extensive numerical experiments on a synthetic process and on a replicated Tennessee Eastman Process show that the conceptually simpler manifold-fitting approach achieves performance competitive with, and sometimes superior to, the more classical lower-dimensional manifold monitoring methods. In addition, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed manifold-fitting approach by successfully detecting surface anomalies in a real image dataset of electrical commutators.

Abstract: Deep learning is increasingly used for complex, large-scale systems where first-principles modeling is difficult. However, standard deep learning models often fail to enforce physical structure or preserve convexity in downstream control, leading to physically inconsistent predictions and discontinuous inputs owing to nonconvexity. We introduce sign constraints--sign restrictions on Jacobian entries--that unify monotonicity, positivity, and sign-definiteness; additionally, we develop model-construction methods that enforce them, together with a control-synthesis procedure. In particular, we design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.

<title>Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.

Abstract: Efficient design of genomic perturbation experiments is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and therapeutic target identification, yet exhaustive perturbation of the human genome remains infeasible due to the vast search space of potential genetic interactions and experimental constraints. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful framework for selecting informative interventions, but existing approaches often fail to exploit domain-specific biological prior knowledge. We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is available at https://github.com/NicoSchulthess/anomalydino-dpmm.

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning, particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Abstract: In 2011, einsum was introduced to NumPy as a practical and convenient notation for tensor expressions in machine learning, quantum circuit simulation, and other fields. It has since been implemented in additional Python frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as in other programming languages such as Julia. Despite its practical success, the einsum notation still lacks a solid theoretical basis, and is not unified across the different frameworks, limiting opportunities for formal reasoning and systematic optimization. In this work, we discuss the terminology of tensor expressions and provide a formal definition of the einsum language. Based on this definition, we formalize and prove important equivalence rules for tensor expressions and highlight their relevance in practical applications.

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates, creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a "nuisance space" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation techniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline space flexibility while introducing "gravitational" terms that encourage convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits and enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: Secure monitoring and dynamic control in an IIoT environment are major requirements for current development goals. We believe that dynamic, secure monitoring of the IIoT environment can be achieved through integration with the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Digital Twin (DT) paradigms. The current literature lacks implementation details for SDN-based DT and time-aware intelligent model training for short-term anomaly detection against IIoT threats. Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly detection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware labeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm. According to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU- accelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of high recall and strong classification performance.

Abstract: Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception, particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work, we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral segmentation methods. We make the code available at https://hyperspectraladapter.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: The "No Free Lunch" theorem dictates that no single recommender algorithm is optimal for all users, creating a significant Algorithm Selection Problem. Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, "black-box" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.

Abstract: Consider N players and K games taking place simultaneously. Each of these games is modeled as a Tug-of-War (ToW) game where increasing the action of one player decreases the reward for all other players. Each player participates in only one game at any given time. At each time step, a player decides the game in which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game. Their reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game. This system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game. These games can model scenarios such as power control, distributed task allocation, and activation in sensor networks. We propose the Meta Tug-of-Peace algorithm, a distributed algorithm where the action updates are done using a simple stochastic approximation algorithm, and the decision to switch games is made using an infrequent 1-bit communication between the players. We prove that in Meta-ToW games, our algorithm converges to an equilibrium that satisfies a target Quality of Service reward vector for the players. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through simulations for the scenarios mentioned above.

Abstract: API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models~(LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models were able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.

Abstract: This paper introduces a simple and scalable approach to improve the data efficiency of large language model (LLM) training by augmenting existing text data with thinking trajectories. The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar pipelines.

<title>ImageNet-trained CNNs are not biased towards texture: Revisiting feature reliance through controlled suppression</title>

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance towards texture.

<title>Error Propagation in Dynamic Programming: From Stochastic Control to Option Pricing</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates theoretical and methodological foundations for stochastic optimal control (SOC) in discrete time. We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.

<title>Feeding Two Birds or Favoring One? Adequacy-Fluency Tradeoffs in Evaluation and Meta-Evaluation of Machine Translation</title>

Abstract: We investigate the tradeoff between adequacy and fluency in machine translation. We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly, we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.

<title>Ads that Stick: Near-Optimal Ad Optimization through Psychological Behavior Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20304</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Optimizing the timing and frequency of ads is a central problem in digital advertising, with significant economic consequences. Existing scheduling policies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps, that overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users' long-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several psychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).
  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on three key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and operant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave function of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is modeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user interest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask the following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads should be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the ads?
  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of displayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the operant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm that outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the performance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small. Our algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and shows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many natural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on the mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a simple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings with experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various baselines.

Abstract: Exoplanet imaging is a major challenge in astrophysics due to the need for high angular resolution and high contrast. We present a multi-scale statistical model for the nuisance component corrupting multivariate image series at high contrast. Integrated into a learnable architecture, it leverages the physics of the problem and enables the fusion of multiple observations of the same star in a way that is optimal in terms of detection signal-to-noise ratio. Applied to data from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, the method significantly improves the detection sensitivity and the accuracy of astrometric and photometric estimation.

Abstract: Hope speech language that fosters encouragement and optimism plays a vital role in promoting positive discourse online. However, its detection remains challenging, especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection using an active learning approach and transformer-based models, including mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa. Experiments were conducted on datasets in English, Spanish, German, and Urdu, including benchmark test sets from recent shared tasks. Our results show that transformer models significantly outperform traditional baselines, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest overall accuracy. Furthermore, our active learning strategy maintained strong performance even with small annotated datasets. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining multilingual transformers with data-efficient training strategies for hope speech detection.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics. VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at: https://visualmimic.github.io .

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of high-quality synthetic data -- generated by advanced AI models or collected as auxiliary data from related tasks -- presents both opportunities and challenges for statistical inference. This paper introduces a GEneral Synthetic-Powered Inference (GESPI) framework that wraps around any statistical inference procedure to safely enhance sample efficiency by combining synthetic and real data. Our framework leverages high-quality synthetic data to boost statistical power, yet adaptively defaults to the standard inference method using only real data when synthetic data is of low quality. The error of our method remains below a user-specified bound without any distributional assumptions on the synthetic data, and decreases as the quality of the synthetic data improves. This flexibility enables seamless integration with conformal prediction, risk control, hypothesis testing, and multiple testing procedures, all without modifying the base inference method. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging tasks with limited labeled data, including AlphaFold protein structure prediction, and comparing large reasoning models on complex math problems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a vector-valued objective function $\boldsymbol{f}$ sampled from a Gaussian Process (GP) whose index set is a well-behaved, compact metric space $({\cal X},d)$ of designs. We assume that $\boldsymbol{f}$ is not known beforehand and that evaluating $\boldsymbol{f}$ at design $x$ results in a noisy observation of $\boldsymbol{f}(x)$. Since identifying the Pareto optimal designs via exhaustive search is infeasible when the cardinality of ${\cal X}$ is large, we propose an algorithm, called Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL, that exploits the smoothness of the GP-sampled function and the structure of $({\cal X},d)$ to learn fast. In essence, Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL employs a tree-based adaptive discretization technique to identify an $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set of designs in as few evaluations as possible. We provide both information-type and metric dimension-type bounds on the sample complexity of $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set identification. We also experimentally show that our algorithm outperforms other Pareto set identification methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are predominantly developed for stationary environments, and the limited literature that considers nonstationary environments often involves specific assumptions about changes that can occur in transition probability matrices and reward functions. Considering that real-world applications involve environments that continuously evolve due to various external events, and humans make decisions by discerning patterns in historical events, this study investigates Markov Decision Processes under the influence of an external temporal process. We establish the conditions under which the problem becomes tractable, allowing it to be addressed by considering only a finite history of events, based on the properties of the perturbations introduced by the exogenous process. We propose and theoretically analyze a policy iteration algorithm to tackle this problem, which learns policies contingent upon the current state of the environment, as well as a finite history of prior events of the exogenous process. We show that such an algorithm is not guaranteed to converge. However, we provide a guarantee for policy improvement in regions of the state space determined by the approximation error induced by considering tractable policies and value functions. We also establish the sample complexity of least-squares policy evaluation and policy improvement algorithms that consider approximations due to the incorporation of only a finite history of temporal events. While our results are applicable to general discrete-time processes satisfying certain conditions on the rate of decay of the influence of their events, we further analyze the case of discrete-time Hawkes processes with Gaussian marks. We performed experiments to demonstrate our findings for policy evaluation and deployment in traditional control environments.

Abstract: On tabular data, a significant body of literature has shown that current deep learning (DL) models perform at best similarly to Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs), while significantly underperforming them on outlier data. However, these works often study idealized problem settings which may fail to capture complexities of real-world scenarios. We identify a natural tabular data setting where DL models can outperform GBDTs: tabular Learning-to-Rank (LTR) under label scarcity. Tabular LTR applications, including search and recommendation, often have an abundance of unlabeled data, and scarce labeled data. We show that DL rankers can utilize unsupervised pretraining to exploit this unlabeled data. In extensive experiments over both public and proprietary datasets, we show that pretrained DL rankers consistently outperform GBDT rankers on ranking metrics -- sometimes by as much as 38% -- both overall and on outliers.

Abstract: Neural CDEs provide a natural way to process the temporal evolution of irregular time series. The number of function evaluations (NFE) is these systems' natural analog of depth (the number of layers in traditional neural networks). It is usually regulated via solver error tolerance: lower tolerance means higher numerical precision, requiring more integration steps. However, lowering tolerances does not adequately increase the models' expressiveness. We propose a simple yet effective alternative: scaling the integration time horizon to increase NFEs and "deepen`` the model. Increasing the integration interval causes uncontrollable growth in conventional vector fields, so we also propose a way to stabilize the dynamics via Negative Feedback (NF). It ensures provable stability without constraining flexibility. It also implies robustness: we provide theoretical bounds for Neural ODE risk using Gaussian process theory. Experiments on four open datasets demonstrate that our method, DeNOTS, outperforms existing approaches~ -- ~including recent Neural RDEs and state space models,~ -- ~achieving up to $20\%$ improvement in metrics. DeNOTS combines expressiveness, stability, and robustness, enabling reliable modelling in continuous-time domains.

Abstract: Transformers have gained attention in atmospheric time series forecasting (ATSF) for their ability to capture global spatial-temporal correlations. However, their complex architectures lead to excessive parameter counts and extended training times, limiting their scalability to large-scale forecasting. In this paper, we revisit ATSF from a theoretical perspective of atmospheric dynamics and uncover a key insight: spatial-temporal position embedding (STPE) can inherently model spatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. Its effectiveness arises from the integration of geographical coordinates and temporal features, which are intrinsically linked to atmospheric dynamics. Based on this, we propose STELLA, a Spatial-Temporal knowledge Embedded Lightweight modeL for ASTF, utilizing only STPE and an MLP architecture in place of Transformer layers. With 10k parameters and one hour of training, STELLA achieves superior performance on five datasets compared to other advanced methods. The paper emphasizes the effectiveness of spatial-temporal knowledge integration over complex architectures, providing novel insights for ATSF. The code is available at https://github.com/GestaltCogTeam/STELLA.

Abstract: For learned image representations, basic autoencoders often produce blurry results. Reconstruction quality can be improved by incorporating additional penalties such as adversarial (GAN) and perceptual losses. Arguably, these approaches lack a principled interpretation. Concurrently, in generative settings diffusion has demonstrated a remarkable ability to create crisp, high quality results and has solid theoretical underpinnings (from variational inference to direct study as the Fisher Divergence). Our work combines autoencoder representation learning with diffusion and is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate jointly learning a continuous encoder and decoder under a diffusion-based loss and showing that it can lead to higher compression and better generation. We demonstrate that this approach yields better reconstruction quality as compared to GAN-based autoencoders while being easier to tune. We also show that the resulting representation is easier to model with a latent diffusion model as compared to the representation obtained from a state-of-the-art GAN-based loss. Since our decoder is stochastic, it can generate details not encoded in the otherwise deterministic latent representation; we therefore name our approach "Sample what you can't compress", or SWYCC for short.

Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce a long-standing obstacle to backpropagation, particularly in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. The standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) is widely used to address this, but the well-understood mismatch between its quantization-aware forward pass and quantization-oblivious backward pass leads to unmanaged error that can corrupt the learning process. We solve this by introducing a denoising dequantization transform derived from a principled ridge regression objective. This transform makes the entire learning process aware of and robust to the quantization error that STE's surrogate gradient bypasses, by creating an explicit, corrective gradient path. We extend this principle to sparsification by viewing it as a special form of quantization that maps insignificant values to zero. Our unified framework allows existing models to be trained at a wide spectrum of precisions and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes, achieving stable training of fully binary (A1W1) and sparse sub-1-bit networks where other methods falter. This approach yields state-of-the-art results and provides a theoretically-grounded path to hyper-efficient neural networks.

Abstract: Computational wave imaging (CWI) extracts hidden structure and physical properties of a volume of material by analyzing wave signals that traverse that volume. Applications include seismic exploration of the Earth's subsurface, acoustic imaging and non-destructive testing in material science, and ultrasound computed tomography in medicine. Current approaches for solving CWI problems can be divided into two categories: those rooted in traditional physics, and those based on deep learning. Physics-based methods stand out for their ability to provide high-resolution and quantitatively accurate estimates of acoustic properties within the medium. However, they can be computationally intensive and are susceptible to ill-posedness and nonconvexity typical of CWI problems. Machine learning-based computational methods have recently emerged, offering a different perspective to address these challenges. Diverse scientific communities have independently pursued the integration of deep learning in CWI. This review discusses how contemporary scientific machine-learning (ML) techniques, and deep neural networks in particular, have been developed to enhance and integrate with traditional physics-based methods for solving CWI problems.
  We present a structured framework that consolidates existing research spanning multiple domains, including computational imaging, wave physics, and data science. This study concludes with important lessons learned from existing ML-based methods and identifies technical hurdles and emerging trends through a systematic analysis of the extensive literature on this topic.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive (AR) predictions within scientific machine learning models by exploring temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We introduce the first implementation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth method specifically tailored for data-driven AR prediction, leveraging historical derivative information to enhance numerical stability without additional computational overhead. To validate our approach, we systematically evaluate time integration schemes across canonical 2D PDEs before extending to complex Navier-Stokes cylinder vortex shedding dynamics. Additionally, we develop three novel adaptive weighting strategies that dynamically adjust the importance of different future time steps during multi-step rollout training. Our analysis reveals that as physical complexity increases, such sophisticated rollout techniques become essential, with the Adams-Bashforth scheme demonstrating consistent robustness across investigated systems and our best adaptive approach delivering an 89% improvement over conventional fixed-weight methods while maintaining similar computational costs. For the complex Navier-Stokes vortex shedding problem, despite using an extremely lightweight graph neural network with just 1,177 trainable parameters and training on only 50 snapshots, our framework accurately predicts 350 future time steps reducing mean squared error from 0.125 (single-step direct prediction) to 0.002 (Adams-Bashforth with proposed multi-step rollout). Our integrated methodology demonstrates an 83% improvement over standard noise injection techniques and maintains robustness under severe spatial constraints; specifically, when trained on only a partial spatial domain, it still achieves 58% and 27% improvements over direct prediction and forward Euler methods, respectively.

Abstract: Mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solvers expose hundreds of parameters that have an outsized impact on performance but are difficult to configure for all but expert users. Existing machine learning (ML) approaches require training on thousands of related instances, generalize poorly and can be difficult to integrate into existing solver workflows. We propose a large language model (LLM)-based framework that configures cutting plane separators using problem descriptions and solver-specific separator summaries. To reduce variance in LLM outputs, we introduce an ensembling strategy that clusters and aggregates candidate configurations into a small portfolio of high-performing configurations. Our method requires no custom solver interface, generates configurations in seconds via simple API calls, and requires solving only a small number of instances. Extensive experiments on standard synthetic and real-world MILPs show our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art configuration methods with a fraction of the data and computation.

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that mutual distillation between reinforcement learning policies serves as an implicit regularization, preventing them from overfitting to irrelevant features. We highlight two separate contributions: (i) Theoretically, for the first time, we prove that enhancing the policy robustness to irrelevant features leads to improved generalization performance. (ii) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Ultimately, we do not claim to achieve state-of-the-art performance but rather focus on uncovering the underlying principles of generalization and deepening our understanding of its mechanisms.

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), in which a momentum term is added to SGD, has been well studied in both theory and practice. The theoretical studies show that the settings of the learning rate and momentum weight affect the convergence of SGDM. Meanwhile, the practical studies have shown that the batch-size setting strongly affects the performance of SGDM. In this paper, we focus on mini-batch SGDM with a constant learning rate and constant momentum weight, which is frequently used to train deep neural networks. We show theoretically that using a constant batch size does not always minimize the expectation of the full gradient norm of the empirical loss in training a deep neural network, whereas using an increasing batch size definitely minimizes it; that is, an increasing batch size improves the convergence of mini-batch SGDM. We also provide numerical results supporting our analyses, indicating specifically that mini-batch SGDM with an increasing batch size converges to stationary points faster than with a constant batch size, while also reducing computational cost. Python implementations of the optimizers used in the numerical experiments are available at https://github.com/iiduka-researches/NSHB_increasing_batchsize_acml25/.

While the squared error loss permits a straightforward decomposition, other loss functions - such as zero-one loss or $L_1$ loss - either fail to sum bias and variance to the expected loss or rely on definitions that lack the essential properties of meaningful bias and variance. Recent research has shown that clean decompositions can be achieved for the broader class of Bregman divergences, with the cross-entropy loss as a special case. However, the necessary and sufficient conditions for these decompositions remain an open question.
  In this paper, we address this question by studying continuous, nonnegative loss functions that satisfy the identity of indiscernibles (zero loss if and only if the two arguments are identical), under mild regularity conditions. We prove that so-called $g$-Bregman divergences are the only such loss functions that have a clean bias-variance decomposition. A $g$-Bregman divergence can be transformed into a standard Bregman divergence through an invertible change of variables. This makes the squared Mahalanobis distance, up to such a variable transformation, the only symmetric loss function with a clean bias-variance decomposition. Consequently, common metrics such as $0$-$1$ and $L_1$ losses cannot admit a clean bias-variance decomposition, explaining why previous attempts have failed. We also examine the impact of relaxing the restrictions on the loss functions and how this affects our results.

Abstract: Rule-based models are essential for high-stakes decision-making due to their transparency and interpretability, but their discrete nature creates challenges for optimization and scalability. In this work, we present the Fuzzy Rule-based Reasoner (FRR), a novel gradient-based rule learning system that supports strict user constraints over rule-based complexity while achieving competitive performance. To maximize interpretability, the FRR uses semantically meaningful fuzzy logic partitions, unattainable with existing neuro-fuzzy approaches, and sufficient (single-rule) decision-making, which avoids the combinatorial complexity of additive rule ensembles. Through extensive evaluation across 40 datasets, FRR demonstrates: (1) superior performance to traditional rule-based methods (e.g., $5\%$ average accuracy over RIPPER); (2) comparable accuracy to tree-based models (e.g., CART) using rule bases $90\%$ more compact; and (3) achieves $96\%$ of the accuracy of state-of-the-art additive rule-based models while using only sufficient rules and requiring only $3\%$ of their rule base size.

Abstract: Among other uses, neural networks are a powerful tool for solving deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems in real-time, where variational autoencoders, a specialized type of neural network, enable the Bayesian estimation of model parameters and their distribution from observational data allowing real-time inverse uncertainty quantification. In this work, we build upon existing research [Goh, H. et al., Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 2022] by proposing a novel loss function to train variational autoencoders for Bayesian inverse problems. When the forward map is affine, we provide a theoretical proof of the convergence of the latent states of variational autoencoders to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. We validate this theoretical result through numerical tests and we compare the proposed variational autoencoder with the existing one in the literature both in terms of accuracy and generalization properties. Finally, we test the proposed variational autoencoder on a Laplace equation, with comparison to the original one and Markov Chains Monte Carlo.

<div> Keywords: Nonlinear PDEs, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Buckley-Leverett equation, XPINN framework, two-phase flow

<br><br>Summary: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) presents significant challenges in computational science, especially due to steep gradients and discontinuities. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a meshed-based solution method, but they often struggle with capturing complex wave interactions. To overcome these limitations, the study introduces the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework, which is applied to the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. This approach dynamically decomposes the computational domain into pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing for localized subnetworks to learn distinct behaviors efficiently. Coupling between these subnetworks is established via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, ensuring flux continuity across shock interfaces. Numerical experiments show that XPINN effectively captures discontinuous saturation fronts and complex wave interactions without needing artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Additionally, the XPINN framework exhibits superior stability, quicker convergence, and better resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics while using smaller domain-specific models with fewer parameters. This makes it a scalable tool for tackling challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems. The code is accessible on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains a central challenge in computational science due to the presence of steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional discretization-based solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, this study employs the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux function, which models immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock regions, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors. Coupling between subnetworks is achieved through the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, which enforces physically consistent flux continuity across the moving shock interface. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed XPINN approach accurately captures discontinuous saturation fronts and compound wave interactions without requiring artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. Compared to standard PINNs, the XPINN framework achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and enhanced resolution of nonlinear wave dynamics using smaller, domain-specific models with fewer trainable parameters, establishing it as an effective and scalable tool for solving challenging hyperbolic PDEs in multiphase flow problems.

<div> Keywords: Trajectory Representation Learning, BLUrred Encoding, GPS trajectories, Transformer, Hierarchical patches

<br><br>Summary: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) transforms raw GPS trajectories into vector embeddings for tasks like classification and similarity search. While state-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods capture high-level travel semantics by using grid or road trajectories, they tend to lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details due to grouping multiple GPS points. To address this issue, the proposed BLUrred Encoding method (BLUE) hierarchically reduces GPS coordinate precision, creating small low-level patches that retain detailed information and larger high-level patches that capture overall travel patterns. BLUE employs an encoder-decoder architecture with a pyramid structure, utilizing Transformers to learn trajectory embeddings at various patch levels. Pooling prepares inputs for higher levels in the encoder, while up-resolution guides lower levels in the decoder. The model is trained using a trajectory reconstruction task with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. Comparisons show that BLUE outperforms eight SOTA TRL methods across three downstream tasks, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 30.90% over the best-performing baselines. The implementation code is accessible at GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Trajectory representation learning (TRL) maps trajectories to vector embeddings and facilitates tasks such as trajectory classification and similarity search. State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, adversarial attacks, Gradient-Feature Alignment, robustness, CIFAR-10

<br><br>Summary: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial perturbations, which are small, intentionally crafted changes that lead to incorrect predictions. This paper introduces DeepDefense, a defense framework that utilizes Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to reduce adversarial vulnerability. DeepDefense works by aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, creating a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions and thus decreasing sensitivity to adversarial noise. The authors provide theoretical insights explaining how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components, detailing the effectiveness of alignment in suppressing loss variation in tangential directions where attacks are most potent. Empirical results demonstrate that models trained with DeepDefense significantly improve robustness against gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset, CNN models using DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% against APGD attacks and 24.7% against FGSM attacks. Additionally, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times greater perturbation magnitudes to misclassify samples under optimization-based attacks, showcasing stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. The approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, highlighting a promising path for enhancing adversarial robustness in deep learning models. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which are small and carefully crafted inputs that lead to incorrect predictions. In this paper, we propose DeepDefense, a novel defense framework that applies Gradient-Feature Alignment (GFA) regularization across multiple layers to suppress adversarial vulnerability. By aligning input gradients with internal feature representations, DeepDefense promotes a smoother loss landscape in tangential directions, thereby reducing the model's sensitivity to adversarial noise.
  We provide theoretical insights into how adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into radial and tangential components and demonstrate that alignment suppresses loss variation in tangential directions, where most attacks are effective. Empirically, our method achieves significant improvements in robustness across both gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. For example, on CIFAR-10, CNN models trained with DeepDefense outperform standard adversarial training by up to 15.2% under APGD attacks and 24.7% under FGSM attacks. Against optimization-based attacks such as DeepFool and EADEN, DeepDefense requires 20 to 30 times higher perturbation magnitudes to cause misclassification, indicating stronger decision boundaries and a flatter loss landscape. Our approach is architecture-agnostic, simple to implement, and highly effective, offering a promising direction for improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models.

<div> Keywords: image generation, social biases, SCALEX, latent spaces, diffusion models

<br><br>Summary: The article discusses the presence of social biases, particularly stereotypes related to gender, race, and profession, in image generation models. Traditional methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models are limited as they often focus on predefined categories or rely on manual interpretation, which restricts scalability and the detection of nuanced or unexpected patterns. To address these issues, the authors present SCALEX, a novel framework for the scalable and automatic exploration of latent spaces in diffusion models. SCALEX utilizes natural language prompts to extract semantically meaningful directions from the model's latent space, allowing for zero-shot interpretation without the need for retraining or labeling data. This capability facilitates systematic comparisons across various concepts and enables the large-scale discovery of internal model associations. The framework successfully identifies gender bias in profession-related prompts, ranks semantic alignment among identity descriptors, and uncovers clustered conceptual structures autonomously. By directly linking prompts to latent directions, SCALEX enhances the scalability, interpretability, and extensibility of bias analysis in diffusion models compared to existing approaches. <div>

Abstract: Image generation models frequently encode social biases, including stereotypes tied to gender, race, and profession. Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.
  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling. This allows systematic comparison across arbitrary concepts and large-scale discovery of internal model associations. We show that SCALEX detects gender bias in profession prompts, ranks semantic alignment across identity descriptors, and reveals clustered conceptual structure without supervision. By linking prompts to latent directions directly, SCALEX makes bias analysis in diffusion models more scalable, interpretable, and extensible than prior approaches.

<div> Keywords: Brain-Computer Interface, EEG, Motor Imagery, Channel Selection, Feature Fusion<br><br>Summary:<br>1. This study proposes a novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) method that enhances classification accuracy by using brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion applied to EEG signals.<br>2.

arXiv:2511.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) connects the human brain to the outside world, providing a direct communication channel. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are commonly used in BCIs to reflect cognitive patterns related to motor function activities. However, due to the multichannel nature of EEG signals, explicit information processing is crucial to lessen computational complexity in BCI systems. This study proposes an innovative method based on brain region-specific channel selection and multi-domain feature fusion to improve classification accuracy. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in region-based channel selection, where EEG channels are grouped according to their functional relevance to distinct brain regions. By selecting channels based on specific regions involved in motor imagery (MI) tasks, this technique eliminates irrelevant channels, reducing data dimensionality and improving computational efficiency. This also ensures that the extracted features are more reflective of the brain actual activity related to motor tasks. Three distinct feature extraction methods Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Fuzzy C-means clustering, and Tangent Space Mapping (TSM), are applied to each group of channels based on their brain region. Each method targets different characteristics of the EEG signal: CSP focuses on spatial patterns, Fuzzy C means identifies clusters within the data, and TSM captures non-linear patterns in the signal. The combined feature vector is used to classify motor imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, and right foot) using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method was validated on publicly available benchmark EEG datasets (IVA and I) from the BCI competition III and IV. The results show that the approach outperforms existing methods, achieving classification accuracies of 90.77% and 84.50% for datasets IVA and I, respectively.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction, Adversarial Attack, Robustness, Automated Driving Systems<br><br>Summary:  
This study investigates the vulnerability of large language model (LLM)-based vehicle trajectory prediction systems used in automated driving. While previous research has shown that fine-tuned LLMs can effectively predict vehicle behaviors such as lane changes by interpreting data from surrounding vehicles, the robustness of these models under adversarial conditions has not been explored. The authors introduce a novel one-feature differential evolution attack that subtly alters a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM input, operating in a black-box attack scenario. Experimental results on the highD dataset demonstrate that even minor and physically realistic perturbations can significantly degrade prediction accuracy, highlighting the susceptibility of LLM-enabled models to adversarial manipulation. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between prediction accuracy and robustness under attack and sheds light on the mechanisms behind model failures. The study also discusses potential mitigation strategies to enhance system resilience. Overall, this work provides the first systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-driven vehicle trajectory predictors in safety-critical contexts, emphasizing the urgent need to design robustness-enhanced LLM frameworks for intelligent transportation systems to ensure safer automated driving. <div>

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated driving systems has opened new possibilities for reasoning and decision-making by transforming complex driving contexts into language-understandable representations. Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.

<div> Keywords: multimodal learning, modality bias, redundancy, co-information gating, adaptive regulation  

<br><br>Summary:  
Multimodal learning improves performance by integrating data from multiple sources. However, during joint training, modality bias can lead to an imbalance where a dominant modality overshadows others, causing two main issues. Firstly, the prolonged influence of the dominant modality can weaken the coupling between representations and outputs, leading to redundant information accumulation. Secondly, current techniques often adjust gradients of the dominant modality uniformly, neglecting the semantic relationships and directionalities between modalities. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), inspired by the information bottleneck principle. The method includes a redundancy phase monitor, which activates intervention only when redundancy is high, utilizing a joint criterion of effective gain growth and redundancy. Additionally, a co-information gating mechanism evaluates the dominant modality’s contribution based on cross-modal semantics, ensuring the preservation of modality-specific information when reliance on a single modality is necessary. Finally, the approach involves projecting the dominant modality's gradient onto the orthogonal complement of the multimodal gradient subspace to adjust and suppress the gradient based on redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that RedReg outperforms existing methods, and ablation studies confirm its effectiveness. The code for the method is publicly accessible. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to improve performance by leveraging data from multiple sources. During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: probabilistic forecasting, cumulative distribution function, deep lattice networks, quantile regression, solar irradiance

<br><br>Summary: The article discusses the significance of probabilistic forecasting in capturing sudden changes in time series data, emphasizing its advantage over point predictions. Traditionally, modeling cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) relied on parametric methods, but recent advancements allow for nonparametric approaches. The authors propose an innovative method that integrates probabilistic forecasting with monotonic networks, specifically through the adaptation of deep lattice networks (DLN) to conduct simultaneous and implicit quantile regression. This adaptation addresses the issue of quantile crossovers in quantile regression, ensuring a legitimate CDF is produced. By utilizing long short-term memory units (LSTM) in the embedding layer and distributing quantile inputs across all sub-lattices in the DLN, the model can forecast implicit CDFs effectively while adhering to monotonic constraints. The paper showcases the model's performance in generating day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance, revealing that the adapted DLN competes favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it outperforms a scalable monotonic neural network, highlighting the potential for further exploration in the fields of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting. <div>
arXiv:2511.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting is not only a way to add more information to a prediction of the future, but it also builds on weaknesses in point prediction. Sudden changes in a time series can still be captured by a cumulative distribution function (CDF), while a point prediction is likely to miss it entirely. The modeling of CDFs within forecasts has historically been limited to parametric approaches, but due to recent advances, this no longer has to be the case. We aim to advance the fields of probabilistic forecasting and monotonic networks by connecting them and propose an approach that permits the forecasting of implicit, complete, and nonparametric CDFs. For this purpose, we propose an adaptation to deep lattice networks (DLN) for monotonically constrained simultaneous/implicit quantile regression in time series forecasting. Quantile regression usually produces quantile crossovers, which need to be prevented to achieve a legitimate CDF. By leveraging long short term memory units (LSTM) as the embedding layer, and spreading quantile inputs to all sub-lattices of a DLN with an extended output size, we can produce a multi-horizon forecast of an implicit CDF due to the monotonic constraintability of DLNs that prevent quantile crossovers. We compare and evaluate our approach's performance to relevant state of the art within the context of a highly relevant application of time series forecasting: Day-ahead, hourly forecasts of solar irradiance observations. Our experiments show that the adaptation of a DLN performs just as well or even better than an unconstrained approach. Further comparison of the adapted DLN against a scalable monotonic neural network shows that our approach performs better. With this adaptation of DLNs, we intend to create more interest and crossover investigations in techniques of monotonic neural networks and probabilistic forecasting.

<div> Keywords: ChemFixer, molecular generation, deep learning, drug discovery, validity

<br><br>Summary: This paper presents ChemFixer, a framework that addresses the challenge of generating chemically valid molecules in deep learning-based molecular generation models. These models are capable of exploring extensive chemical spaces but often yield invalid molecules, limiting their practical application in drug discovery. ChemFixer utilizes a transformer architecture and is pre-trained with masking techniques, subsequently fine-tuned on a large dataset of valid and invalid molecular pairs. Evaluations demonstrate that ChemFixer improves the validity of generated molecules while maintaining the original chemical and biological properties. This improvement enables the recovery of previously ungenerated molecules, thereby broadening the diversity of potential drug candidates. Additionally, ChemFixer has been applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task with limited data, resulting in enhanced validity of ligands and the identification of promising ligand-protein pairs. The findings indicate that ChemFixer is effective not only in data-limited scenarios but also adaptable for various downstream applications in drug discovery. Overall, ChemFixer shows significant promise in advancing molecular validity and expanding access to chemical space for future drug development efforts. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning-based molecular generation models have shown great potential in efficiently exploring vast chemical spaces by generating potential drug candidates with desired properties. However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.

<div> Keywords: offensive content, self-training framework, pseudo-labeling, Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models, Positive-Negative-Unlabeled loss

<br><br>Summary: The accurate detection of offensive content on social media is challenged by the scarcity of high-quality labeled data, due to both the low prevalence of such instances and the costs associated with manual annotation. This article presents a self-training framework that addresses this challenge by utilizing abundant unlabeled data through a method called collaborative pseudo-labeling. The framework begins with a lightweight classifier that is trained on a limited amount of labeled data. It iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances by leveraging Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). The approach classifies unlabeled data into two sets: the Agreed-Unknown set, which consists of instances with consensus between the classifier and MA-VLMs, and the Disagreed-Unknown set, which contains conflicting samples. Furthermore, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives representing moderator and user viewpoints to enhance label reliability. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which effectively utilizes labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while minimizing pseudo-label noise. Experimental results on benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines under limited supervision and achieves performance comparable to large-scale models. <div>

Abstract: Accurate detection of offensive content on social media demands high-quality labeled data; however, such data is often scarce due to the low prevalence of offensive instances and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this low-resource challenge, we propose a self-training framework that leverages abundant unlabeled data through collaborative pseudo-labeling. Starting with a lightweight classifier trained on limited labeled data, our method iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled instances with the support of Multi-Agent Vision-Language Models (MA-VLMs). Un-labeled data on which the classifier and MA-VLMs agree are designated as the Agreed-Unknown set, while conflicting samples form the Disagreed-Unknown set. To enhance label reliability, MA-VLMs simulate dual perspectives, moderator and user, capturing both regulatory and subjective viewpoints. The classifier is optimized using a novel Positive-Negative-Unlabeled (PNU) loss, which jointly exploits labeled, Agreed-Unknown, and Disagreed-Unknown data while mitigating pseudo-label noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms baselines under limited supervision and approaches the performance of large-scale models

<div> Keywords: Test-Time Adaptation, MoETTA, Mixture-of-Experts, heterogeneous distribution shifts, benchmark

<br><br>Summary: 
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) is effective for addressing performance drops due to single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world applications often face mixed distribution shifts that involve diverse and conflicting domain factors, which are challenging even for state-of-the-art TTA methods. A primary limitation of current approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path; optimal gradient directions can greatly vary between domains. Additionally, existing benchmarks primarily focus on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, not reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose MoETTA, an entropy-based TTA framework utilizing the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to allow for diverse gradient adaptations through structurally decoupled experts. This enables flexible parameter updates for heterogeneous shifts. To further simulate realistic conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks, potpourri and potpourri+, which include a broader range of domain shifts and test robustness against catastrophic forgetting, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines across various mixed distribution shift settings, establishing state-of-the-art performance and emphasizing the advantages of accommodating multiple adaptation directions through expert-level diversity. <div>

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

<div> Keywords: tokens, incremental learning, single-cell transcriptomics, genes, forgetting problem  

<br><br>Summary: This article examines the underexplored area of incremental learning for tokens, specifically focusing on genes within the context of single-cell transcriptomics. Despite the importance of tokens in various research domains, their incremental learning has received limited attention, largely due to their holistic nature in language. To address this challenge, the authors propose a gene-centric pipeline for incremental learning tailored to a large biological dataset. Their research reveals that the forgetting problem, commonly observed in class incremental learning, also affects gene incremental learning. In response, existing methods from class incremental learning were adapted to help mitigate this forgetting issue. The authors conducted extensive experiments to validate both the design of their framework and the effectiveness of their modifications. Additionally, they present a comprehensive benchmark for gene incremental learning within single-cell transcriptomics, fostering further research in this area. Overall, the study highlights the significance of incremental learning strategies for genes and provides a foundation for future investigations into their dynamic growth and adaptation in biological contexts. <div>

Abstract: Classes, as fundamental elements of Computer Vision, have been extensively studied within incremental learning frameworks. In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations. We found that the forgetting problem also exists in gene incremental learning, thus we adapted existing class incremental learning methods to mitigate the forgetting of genes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated the soundness of our framework design and evaluations, as well as the effectiveness of our method adaptations. Finally, we provide a complete benchmark for gene incremental learning in single-cell transcriptomics.

Abstract: The rapidly evolving landscape of AI and machine learning workloads has widened the gap between high-level domain operations and efficient hardware utilization. Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.
  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target. We implement this technique in an MLIR-based compiler supporting both vector and tile based CPU instructions. Experiments show that the generated nanokernels are of production-quality, and competitive with state-of-the-art microkernel libraries.

<div> Keywords: offline imitation learning, reward function, large language models, preference ranking, policy learning  

<br><br>Summary: 
Offline imitation learning (offline IL) allows for effective policy training without explicit reward annotations. Traditional methods have relied on estimating rewards from a limited set of expert demonstrations, often oversimplifying the relationship between trajectory similarity and reward. The authors introduce PROF, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate and enhance executable reward functions based on natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. A key component of PROF is the Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), which assesses and ranks the quality of reward functions without needing environment interactions or reinforcement learning (RL) training. The RPR computes dominance scores for reward functions, where higher scores reflect better alignment with expert preferences. This framework automates the selection and optimization of reward functions through an iterative process combining RPR and text-based gradient optimization. Empirical evaluations on the D4RL benchmark reveal that PROF either surpasses or matches the performance of existing strong baselines across various datasets and domains, demonstrating its potential to improve offline imitation learning outcomes effectively. <div>

Abstract: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Deep ensembles (DE) have emerged as a powerful approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty and distinguishing its aleatoric and epistemic components, thereby enhancing model robustness and reliability. However, their high computational and memory costs during inference pose significant challenges for wide practical deployment. To overcome this issue, we propose credal ensemble distillation (CED), a novel framework that compresses a DE into a single model, CREDIT, for classification tasks. Instead of a single softmax probability distribution, CREDIT predicts class-wise probability intervals that define a credal set, a convex set of probability distributions, for uncertainty quantification. Empirical results on out-of-distribution detection benchmarks demonstrate that CED achieves superior or comparable uncertainty estimation compared to several existing baselines, while substantially reducing inference overhead compared to DE.

<div> Knowledge Distillation, Dynamic Temperature, Temperature Scheduling, Teacher-Student Model, Cross-Entropy Loss  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses a key limitation in Knowledge Distillation (KD), where the temperature hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities is typically fixed throughout training, which is suboptimal. The authors observe that students benefit from softer output probabilities in the early phases of training and require sharper probabilities in later stages for better learning. To tackle this, they propose the Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the temperature based on the cross-entropy loss gap between the teacher and student models. This adaptive adjustment allows the temperature to better reflect the divergence between teacher and student distributions over time. DTS is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing KD methods without adding complexity. The method was empirically validated across multiple datasets and tasks, including vision benchmarks like CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, as well as various NLP tasks such as GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, and S-NI. The results consistently demonstrate that DTS outperforms static-temperature baselines, substantiating the benefits of dynamic temperature scheduling in improving student model performance. The authors also provide open-source code to facilitate adoption and further research. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) trains a smaller student model using a large, pre-trained teacher model, with temperature as a key hyperparameter controlling the softness of output probabilities. Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, programming, Cajal, linear neurons, gradient-based learning

<br><br>Summary: The article discusses the challenge of directly programming neural networks, which traditionally rely on learning algorithms like gradient descent that often lack discrete structure. This limitation prevents the compilation of many discrete algorithms into neural networks, as they are typically not differentiable. To overcome this issue, the authors introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$, a higher-order linear programming language designed specifically to facilitate direct programming of neural networks. They demonstrate that $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs can compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be represented in a form suitable for gradient-based learning. The implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$ is explored through various experiments where linear neurons are integrated with other neural networks. This integration results in enhanced learning speed, greater data efficiency, and improved debug capabilities. The study concludes that linear programming languages like $\textsf{Cajal}$ can create a productive interaction between learning and the discrete structures characteristic of conventional programming, suggesting a novel approach to programming neural networks more effectively. <div>
arXiv:2511.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We don't program neural networks directly. Instead, we rely on an indirect style where learning algorithms, like gradient descent, determine a neural network's function by learning from data. This indirect style is often a virtue; it empowers us to solve problems that were previously impossible. But it lacks discrete structure. We can't compile most algorithms into a neural network -- even if these algorithms could help the network learn. This limitation occurs because discrete algorithms are not obviously differentiable, making them incompatible with the gradient-based learning algorithms that determine a neural network's function. To address this, we introduce $\textsf{Cajal}$: a typed, higher-order and linear programming language intended to be a minimal vehicle for exploring a direct style of programming neural networks. We prove $\textsf{Cajal}$ programs compile to linear neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation of $\textsf{Cajal}$, we conduct several experiments where we link these linear neurons against other neural networks to determine part of their function prior to learning. Linking with these neurons allows networks to learn faster, with greater data-efficiency, and in a way that's easier to debug. A key lesson is that linear programming languages provide a path towards directly programming neural networks, enabling a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.

<div> Keywords: self-attention, distributional semantics, co-occurrence matrix, GloVe embeddings, Transformer architecture  

<br><br>Summary: This paper offers a mathematical interpretation of self-attention by linking it to principles of distributional semantics. It asserts that self-attention arises from projecting corpus-level co-occurrence statistics into sequence context. The authors begin with the co-occurrence matrix associated with GloVe embeddings, illustrating how this projection effectively captures contextual influence. Furthermore, they explain that the query-key-value mechanism represents a natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. The study also emphasizes how positional encodings and multi-head attention serve as structured refinements of this projection principle. By connecting these concepts, the analysis reveals that the specific algebraic form of the Transformer architecture stems from these foundational projection principles, challenging the notion that its design choices are arbitrary. This provides a deeper understanding of how self-attention functions in the context of language processing and highlights the intricate relationship between statistical methods and neural network architectures in natural language processing. <div>

Starting from the co-occurrence matrix underlying GloVe embeddings, we demonstrate how the projection naturally captures contextual influence, with the query-key-value mechanism arising as the natural asymmetric extension for modeling directional relationships. Positional encodings and multi-head attention then follow as structured refinements of this same projection principle. Our analysis demonstrates that the Transformer architecture's particular algebraic form follows from these projection principles rather than being an arbitrary design choice.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised learning, transferability, task conflict, meta-learning, Task Conflict Calibration  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper explores the transferability of self-supervised learning (SSL) representations, focusing on two key questions: what constitutes representation transferability in SSL and how to effectively model it. Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support objectives of other tasks. Inspired by meta-learning, the authors construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to explicitly model transferability by introducing task-level information. However, empirical results and causal analysis reveal that while task-level information improves transferability, the process is still hampered by task conflict, where conflicting task objectives limit performance. To address this, the authors propose the Task Conflict Calibration (TC²) method. TC² works by splitting batches to form multiple SSL tasks, then using a factor extraction network to generate causal generative factors for all tasks, alongside a weight extraction network that assigns importance weights to samples. It employs data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity constraints to enhance effectiveness. Finally, TC² calibrates sample representations through a two-stage bi-level optimization training framework, which significantly boosts transferability. Experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate that TC² consistently enhances the transferability performance of SSL models. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

<div> Keywords: large language models, adversarial interactions, alignment safeguards, harm score, attacker-target exchanges  

<br><br>Summary: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent, safety-critical contexts, focusing on whether larger models can jailbreak smaller ones despite alignment safeguards. Utilizing the JailbreakBench standardized adversarial tasks, researchers conducted over 6,000 multi-turn interactions across various LLM sizes (0.6B to 120B parameters). The study measures harmful outcomes and alignment integrity through harm and refusal scores rated by three independent LLM judges. Results revealed a significant correlation between the mean harm score and the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001), indicating that larger relative model sizes increase harmful behavior likelihood. Variance in mean harm scores was greater for attackers (0.18) than for targets (0.10), highlighting that the behavior of attackers is more influential on outcomes than target susceptibility. Additionally, there was a strong negative correlation (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001) between attacker refusal frequency and harm, suggesting that robust attacker-side alignment reduces harmful responses. These findings emphasize the role of size asymmetry in model robustness and indicate a need for further exploration into inter-model alignment and safety. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

<div> Keywords: explainability, deep learning, feature importance, SHAP values, classification accuracy  

<br><br>Summary: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving transparency in large deep learning models by proposing a novel differentiable approach to global explainability integrated into the model training process. Traditional post hoc explanation methods are disconnected from training, which limits their effectiveness. The authors introduce the ScoresActivation function, a mechanism for ranking features that is embedded within the learning pipeline, allowing models to prioritize features based on their predictive contributions. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this method yields globally faithful and stable feature rankings that align with SHAP values and ground-truth importance, all while maintaining high predictive performance. Additionally, the proposed feature scoring is significantly faster—150 times quicker—than the classical SHAP method, reducing computation time during training from 300 seconds to just 2 seconds for feature ranking. The method also shows an improvement in classification accuracy, achieving gains of 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant and 11 irrelevant). Overall, the work presents a scalable framework that enhances both model accuracy and interpretability, effectively bridging the gap between these two essential aspects of machine learning. <div>

Abstract: Understanding the decision of large deep learning models is a critical challenge for building transparent and trustworthy systems. Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models, Speculative Decoding, Rollout Efficiency, Distribution-Aware  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the efficiency bottleneck in reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of large language models (LLMs), specifically during the rollout phase where long trajectories are generated token-by-token. The authors identify that a small fraction of long rollouts disproportionately increases wall clock time, highlighting a long-tail distribution of rollout lengths. They also note the potential in leveraging historical rollout data that exhibit stable prompt-level patterns across training epochs. To tackle these issues, they propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without modifying the model’s outputs. DAS combines two innovations: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built dynamically from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length-aware speculation policy that assigns more aggressive draft budgets to longer trajectories driving the overall makespan. This approach capitalizes on rollout history to maintain high acceptance rates while optimizing the cost balance between base and token-level decoding operations. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks demonstrate that DAS can reduce rollout time by up to 50%, all while preserving identical training performance curves. The work shows that distribution-aware speculative decoding provides a significant speedup for RL post-training without sacrificing learning quality. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning(RL) post-training has become essential for aligning large language models (LLMs), yet its efficiency is increasingly constrained by the rollout phase, where long trajectories are generated token by token. We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks show that DAS reduces rollout time up to 50% while preserving identical training curves, demonstrating that distribution-aware speculative decoding can significantly accelerate RL post training without compromising learning quality.

<div> Keywords: class-incremental learning, catastrophic forgetting, pre-trained models, feature adaptation, AnaCP  
  
<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of class-incremental learning (CIL), where a model sequentially learns different tasks with unique classes. Traditional methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to simultaneous learning of feature representations and classifiers without leveraging pre-trained models (PTMs). Recent advancements in CIL have incorporated PTMs as fixed feature extractors alongside analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, these approaches do not allow for the continuous adaptation of feature representations, which can hinder their effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, the authors introduce AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that maintains the benefits of analytic classifiers while facilitating incremental feature adaptation. Remarkably, AnaCP achieves this without requiring gradient-based training, thus preventing CF caused by such updates. The experimental results demonstrate that AnaCP not only surpasses existing baseline methods but also attains accuracy levels equivalent to joint training, which is considered the maximum performance benchmark for CIL. This innovation presents a significant advancement in the continual learning domain, promising improved model performance across incremental learning tasks. <div>

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

<div> Investment planning, power utilities, probabilistic models, sum-product networks, scenario analysis<br><br>Summary:  
This article addresses the challenge of long-term investment planning in power utilities, focusing on generation and transmission expansion under significant uncertainty. Traditional forecasting methods rely on generating a limited number of discrete scenarios (mixtures of Diracs), which restricts understanding of scenario-specific volatility and complicates robust decision-making. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models allow exact and scalable inference of important quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities. By leveraging TPMs, it becomes possible to expand scenarios more robustly and quantify risk more effectively. The framework also supports embedding chance-constrained optimization directly into investment planning, enabling the enforcement of safety or reliability requirements with specified confidence levels. TPMs provide a compact representation of high-dimensional uncertainties, facilitating both detailed scenario analysis and volatility measurement. A case study involving power system planning is presented to demonstrate the computational efficiency and reliability benefits of this approach compared to traditional scenario-based models. The results highlight the potential of TPMs and SPNs to improve robustness and decision-making quality in long-term energy investment strategies. <div>

Abstract: Investment planning in power utilities, such as generation and transmission expansion, requires decade-long forecasts under profound uncertainty. Forecasting of energy mix and energy use decades ahead is nontrivial. Classical approaches focus on generating a finite number of scenarios (modeled as a mixture of Diracs in statistical theory terms), which limits insight into scenario-specific volatility and hinders robust decision-making. We propose an alternative using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs), particularly sum-product networks (SPNs). These models enable exact, scalable inference of key quantities such as scenario likelihoods, marginals, and conditional probabilities, supporting robust scenario expansion and risk assessment.
  This framework enables direct embedding of chance-constrained optimization into investment planning, enforcing safety or reliability with prescribed confidence levels. TPMs allow both scenario analysis and volatility quantification by compactly representing high-dimensional uncertainties. We demonstrate the approach's effectiveness through a representative power system planning case study, illustrating computational and reliability advantages over traditional scenario-based models.

<div> Keywords: differential privacy, tabular data synthesis, MargNet, neural networks, statistical models

<br><br>Summary: The paper discusses the limitations of existing neural network (NN)-based methods for differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis compared to traditional statistical models. It highlights that while statistical models generally perform well, they struggle with densely correlated datasets, where complex dependencies can create challenges. The authors propose a new approach called MargNet, which merges successful elements of statistical models with neural networks. MargNet employs an adaptive marginal selection strategy, allowing the NN to generate data aligned with chosen marginals. On less correlated datasets, MargNet performs comparably to the best statistical methods while being seven times faster. More significantly, for densely correlated datasets, MargNet sets a new benchmark by reducing fidelity error by up to 26% compared to previous bests. The authors emphasize the potential of their approach in handling intricate dependencies within data synthesis tasks. They also make their implementation available on GitHub, promoting further exploration and application of their method in the field of differential privacy for tabular data. <div>
arXiv:2511.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In differentially private (DP) tabular data synthesis, the consensus is that statistical models are better than neural network (NN)-based methods. However, we argue that this conclusion is incomplete and overlooks the challenge of densely correlated datasets, where intricate dependencies can overwhelm statistical models. In such complex scenarios, neural networks are more suitable due to their capacity to fit complex distributions by learning directly from samples. Despite this potential, existing NN-based algorithms still suffer from significant limitations. We therefore propose MargNet, incorporating successful algorithmic designs of statistical models into neural networks. MargNet applies an adaptive marginal selection strategy and trains the neural networks to generate data that conforms to the selected marginals. On sparsely correlated datasets, our approach achieves utility close to the best statistical method while offering an average 7$\times$ speedup over it. More importantly, on densely correlated datasets, MargNet establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing fidelity error by up to 26\% compared to the previous best. We release our code on GitHub.\footnote{https://github.com/KaiChen9909/margnet}

<div> Keywords: renewable energy, forecasting, transformer, weather maps, RMSE

<br><br>Summary: Accurate renewable energy forecasting is critical for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and facilitating grid decarbonization. Current methods struggle to effectively integrate the complex spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal changes. This paper presents a novel methodology that represents weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences for renewable energy prediction. Hourly weather maps are first encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network. These tokens are then analyzed by a transformer model to capture the temporal dynamics over a 45-hour forecasting horizon. Despite some limitations in input initialization, the proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, achieving a reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 60% for wind energy predictions and around 20% for solar energy forecasts when compared to existing ENTSO-E operational forecast methods. This innovative model not only enhances the reliability of renewable energy forecasts but also contributes to better integration of renewable sources into the energy grid. A live dashboard has been developed to provide daily forecasts, accessible at: https://www.sardiniaforecast.ifabfoundation.it. <div>

Abstract: Accurate renewable energy forecasting is essential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and enabling grid decarbonization. However, current approaches fail to effectively integrate the rich spatial context of weather patterns with their temporal evolution. This work introduces a novel approach that treats weather maps as tokens in transformer sequences to predict renewable energy. Hourly weather maps are encoded as spatial tokens using a lightweight convolutional neural network, and then processed by a transformer to capture temporal dynamics across a 45-hour forecast horizon. Despite disadvantages in input initialization, evaluation against ENTSO-E operational forecasts shows a reduction in RMSE of about 60\% and 20\% for wind and solar respectively.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications, yet they remain limited by oversmoothing and poor performance on heterophilic graphs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that equips graphs with a complex-weighted structure, assigning each edge a complex number to drive a diffusion process that extends random walks into the complex domain. We prove that this diffusion is highly expressive: with appropriately chosen complex weights, any node-classification task can be solved in the steady state of a complex random walk. Building on this insight, we propose the Complex-Weighted Convolutional Network (CWCN), which learns suitable complex-weighted structures directly from data while enriching diffusion with learnable matrices and nonlinear activations. CWCN is simple to implement, requires no additional hyperparameters beyond those of standard GNNs, and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that complex-weighted diffusion provides a principled and general mechanism for enhancing GNN expressiveness, opening new avenues for models that are both theoretically grounded and practically effective.

<div> Keywords: Random Forests, bootstrap rate, regression datasets, bias-variance trade-off, hyperparameter tuning

<br><br>Summary: This study investigates the impact of varying the bootstrap rate (BR) on Random Forest (RF) performance across 39 diverse regression datasets and 16 RF configurations. The analysis employs repeated two-fold cross-validation and measures performance using mean squared error. Results indicate that tuning the BR can lead to substantial performance enhancements compared to the default setting (BR = 1.0). Specifically, the optimal BR settings varied: BR ≤ 1.0 was best for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 suited 15 datasets, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in only 4 cases. The research identifies a relationship between dataset characteristics and preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target correlations benefited from higher BRs, while those exhibiting greater local target variance fared better with lower BRs. Further experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels confirmed the bias-variance trade-off: higher BRs helped reduce bias in low-noise contexts, whereas lower BRs mitigated variance in high-noise environments. Overall, the findings underscore the importance of BR as a hyperparameter that should be carefully tuned to enhance RF regression models. <div>

Abstract: Random Forests (RFs) typically train each tree on a bootstrap sample of the same size as the training set, i.e., bootstrap rate (BR) equals 1.0. We systematically examine how varying BR from 0.2 to 5.0 affects RF performance across 39 heterogeneous regression datasets and 16 RF configurations, evaluating with repeated two-fold cross-validation and mean squared error. Our results demonstrate that tuning the BR can yield significant improvements over the default: the best setup relied on BR \leq 1.0 for 24 datasets, BR > 1.0 for 15, and BR = 1.0 was optimal in 4 cases only. We establish a link between dataset characteristics and the preferred BR: datasets with strong global feature-target relationships favor higher BRs, while those with higher local target variance benefit from lower BRs. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled noise levels. These experiments reproduce the observed bias-variance trade-off: in low-noise scenarios, higher BRs effectively reduce model bias, whereas in high-noise settings, lower BRs help reduce model variance. Overall, BR is an influential hyperparameter that should be tuned to optimize RF regression models.

<div> Keywords: Wasserstein-distance, stochastic neural networks, generalization error, multidimensional random fields, uncertainty quantification  

<br><br>Summary: This paper investigates the scalability of a Wasserstein-distance method for training stochastic neural networks (SNNs) to reconstruct multidimensional random field models. The authors prove a generalization error bound when using a limited number of training data, highlighting that the convergence rate of this generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, particularly when dealing with heterogeneous noise across dimensions. This finding suggests a potential alleviation of the "curse of dimensionality" in learning multi-dimensional random field models from finite datasets. Furthermore, improvements to the existing Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach are presented, emphasizing the robustness of the SNN in various scenarios. To validate their method, the researchers conduct numerical experiments across different tasks in multidimensional uncertainty quantification. The results demonstrate that the enhanced Wasserstein-distance training method can effectively train SNNs to learn complex multidimensional uncertainty models, showcasing its efficacy and potential for practical applications in stochastic modeling and uncertainty analysis in high-dimensional settings. <div>

We prove a generalization error bound for reconstructing multidimensional random field models on training stochastic neural networks with a limited number of training data. Our results indicate that when noise is heterogeneous across dimensions, the convergence rate of the generalization error may not depend explicitly on the model's dimensionality, partially alleviating the "curse of dimensionality" for learning multidimensional random field models from a finite number of data points. Additionally, we improve the previous Wasserstein-distance SNN training approach and showcase the robustness of the SNN. Through numerical experiments on different multidimensional uncertainty quantification tasks, we show that our Wasserstein-distance approach can successfully train stochastic neural networks to learn multidimensional uncertainty models.

<div> Keywords: Sparse autoencoders, PCA Whitening, optimization landscape, interpretability, SAEBench

<br><br>Summary: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are useful for learning interpretable features from neural network activations, but their training can be difficult due to input data correlations. The study introduces PCA Whitening as a preprocessing technique to enhance SAE performance across multiple metrics. Theoretical analysis and simulations indicate that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. The evaluation includes both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across various model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical results from SAEBench, a benchmark for sparse autoencoders, demonstrate that whitening enhances interpretability metrics, such as sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite slight decreases in reconstruction quality. This challenges the assumption that interpretability is directly linked to an optimal sparsity-fidelity trade-off. The findings advocate for incorporating whitening as a standard preprocessing step in SAE training, especially when prioritizing interpretability over perfect reconstruction. The study emphasizes the importance of reassessing strategies in SAE training to enhance feature interpretability effectively. <div>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning interpretable features from neural network activations. However, the optimization landscape for SAE training can be challenging due to correlations in the input data. We demonstrate that applying PCA Whitening to input activations -- a standard preprocessing technique in classical sparse coding -- improves SAE performance across multiple metrics. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, we show that whitening transforms the optimization landscape, making it more convex and easier to navigate. We evaluate both ReLU and Top-K SAEs across diverse model architectures, widths, and sparsity regimes. Empirical evaluation on SAEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for sparse autoencoders, reveals that whitening consistently improves interpretability metrics, including sparse probing accuracy and feature disentanglement, despite minor drops in reconstruction quality. Our results challenge the assumption that interpretability aligns with an optimal sparsity--fidelity trade-off and suggest that whitening should be considered as a default preprocessing step for SAE training, particularly when interpretability is prioritized over perfect reconstruction.

<div> Keywords: LLM, SQL, error detection, uncertainty estimation, abstract syntax tree

<br><br>Summary: This article presents a novel framework for detecting errors in SQL generated by large language models (LLMs) through uncertainty estimation at the individual node level in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). The approach involves two main stages. Firstly, it introduces a semantically aware labeling algorithm that assigns node-level correctness for a generated SQL query relative to a gold standard, addressing concerns such as structural containers and alias variations without over-penalization. Secondly, the framework employs a rich set of features, including schema-aware and lexical attributes, to train a supervised classifier that predicts the error probabilities of each node. These probabilities are interpreted as calibrated uncertainty, allowing for precise diagnostics of potential errors within the SQL query. The proposed method outperforms traditional token log-probabilities, achieving an average area under the curve (AUC) improvement of 27.44%, while demonstrating robustness in cross-database evaluations. Additionally, node-level uncertainty aids in targeted repairs and supports human-in-the-loop review processes as well as selective execution downstream. Overall, this work positions node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a compelling alternative to aggregate confidence measures typically used in LLM-generated SQL evaluations. <div>

Abstract: We present a practical framework for detecting errors in LLM-generated SQL by estimating uncertainty at the level of individual nodes in the query's abstract syntax tree (AST). Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong. Across multiple databases and datasets, our method substantially outperforms token log-probabilities: average AUC improves by +27.44% while maintaining robustness under cross-database evaluation. Beyond serving as an accuracy signal, node-level uncertainty supports targeted repair, human-in-the-loop review, and downstream selective execution. Together, these results establish node-centric, semantically grounded uncertainty estimation as a strong and interpretable alternative to aggregate sequence level confidence measures.

<div> Keywords: differential privacy, empirical risk minimization, oracle queries, Lipschitz convex losses, optimization

<br><br>Summary: The paper investigates the running time of differentially private empirical and population risk minimization when using Lipschitz convex losses, focusing on first-order oracle queries. In the non-smooth loss setting, it establishes that to achieve an excess risk of $\alpha$ on a problem of dimension $d$, a necessary expected running time is $\Omega(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/\alpha)}\})$, particularly when $d \geq 1/\alpha^2$. This lower bound is tightened to $\Omega(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}\alpha^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/\alpha)}\})$ for algorithms using minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. For smooth losses, it removes the private oracle assumption and finds a lower bound on oracle calls as $\tilde{\Omega}\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha} + \min\{\frac{1}{\alpha^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. The paper highlights that differentially private optimizers face a runtime penalty dependent on the problem dimension. It also addresses fundamental limitations in optimization when oracles are restricted in the information they can transmit about gradients. <div>
arXiv:2511.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the running time, in terms of first order oracle queries, of differentially private empirical/population risk minimization of Lipschitz convex losses. We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $\Omega(\min\{\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/\alpha)}\})$ is necessary to achieve $\alpha$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \geq 1/\alpha^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\tilde{\Omega}(1/\alpha^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $\Omega(\min\{\frac{d}{\bar{m}\alpha^2}, \frac{d}{\log(1/\alpha)} \})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\bar{m} < \sqrt{d}$. We next consider smooth losses, where we relax the private oracle assumption and give lower bounds under only the condition that the optimizer is private. Here, we lower bound the expected number of first order oracle calls by $\tilde{\Omega}\big(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha} + \min\{\frac{1}{\alpha^2}, n\}\big)$, where $n$ is the size of the dataset. Modifications to existing algorithms show this bound is nearly tight. Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $\Gamma$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $\Omega\big(\min\{\frac{d}{\alpha^2\Gamma}, \frac{d}{\log(1/\alpha)}\}\big)$ oracle calls are needed. This result shows fundamental limitations of gradient quantization techniques in optimization.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian networks, probabilistic graphical models, structure learning, marginalization, probabilistic circuits  

<br><br>Summary:  
Bayesian networks (BNs) are essential probabilistic graphical models used across various fields, yet inferring their graphical structure from data remains a significant challenge. Traditional Bayesian structure learners work by estimating a posterior distribution over possible directed acyclic graphs, but this requires marginalizing over distribution, often constrained by dynamic programming methods that limit potential parent nodes. The authors introduce a novel approach that employs tractable probabilistic circuits to address these limitations. This new method incorporates a learning routine that trains circuits on both the original probability distribution and marginal queries, enabling more flexible model representation. The architecture of probabilistic circuits allows for rapid and accurate marginalization of the learned distribution, thus enhancing the inference process. Empirical results demonstrate that this innovative marginalization technique significantly boosts the performance of Bayesian structure learners compared to existing methods. The findings suggest that leveraging probabilistic circuits can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of learning tasks involving Bayesian networks. <div>

Abstract: Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used class of probabilistic graphical models employed in numerous application domains. However, inferring the network's graphical structure from data remains challenging. Bayesian structure learners approach this problem by inferring a posterior distribution over the possible directed acyclic graphs underlying the BN. The inference process often requires marginalizing over probability distributions, which is typically done using dynamic programming methods that restrict the set of possible parents for each node. Instead, we present a novel method that utilizes tractable probabilistic circuits to circumvent this restriction. This method utilizes a new learning routine that trains these circuits on both the original distribution and marginal queries. The architecture of probabilistic circuits then inherently allows for fast and exact marginalization on the learned distribution. We then show empirically that utilizing our method to answer marginals allows Bayesian structure learners to improve their performance compared to current methods.

<div> Keywords: certified defenses, adversarial input, robustness guarantee, imperceptible perturbations, ImageNet

<br><br>Summary: This study explores the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks in machine learning to understand the constraints of robustness guarantees. The researchers focus on the dual objective of misleading a classifier while also manipulating the certification process, specifically crafting adversarial inputs that can falsely generate robustness certificates. Previous work demonstrated that large perturbations can shift inputs far enough to create a misleading certificate for an incorrect class. This study investigated whether it is possible to create smaller and imperceptible perturbations that achieve misclassification while still prompting certified models to provide deceptive robustness radii for a target class. The concept of region-focused adversarial examples is introduced to craft these imperceptible perturbations, effectively spoofing certificates and generating larger certification radii than those associated with the original source class. Through extensive evaluations on the ImageNet dataset, the study illustrates the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses, such as Densepure. Ultimately, the findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the limitations of current robustness certification methods in the context of adversarial attacks. <div>

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

<div> Keywords: emergent misalignment, refusal unlearning, Cybersecurity, Safety, responsible AI  

<br><br>Summary: This study builds upon recent findings regarding emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomena triggered by fine-tuning models on insecure code data, leading to harmful outputs even for unrelated prompts. The researchers demonstrate that EMA can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains, particularly focusing on Cybersecurity and Safety. Through monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains—Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy—the study reveals that while targeted refusal unlearning can improve compliance for the intended concept, it inadvertently propagates EMA to unrelated areas. Notably, the Safety concept exhibited a more significant detrimental impact on refusal scores in domains like Bias compared to Cybersecurity. The effects were consistent across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v and Qwen-7b-2.5. Additionally, the researchers found that enhancing refusal unlearning with a cross-entropy loss function, using a small set of retained data from affected domains, can help in restoring alignment while still achieving lower refusal rates for the unlearned concept. An analysis of concept vectors indicated that concepts with similar representations in early layers are more prone to experiencing EMA following targeted unlearning interventions. <div>

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian transfer learning, hierarchical models, conformal prediction, small-data analytics, SME machine learning  

<br><br>Summary: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) comprise 99.9% of U.S. businesses, yet they often face challenges in utilizing AI due to their limited data availability. This paper presents SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework that achieves accurate predictions with datasets as small as 50-200 observations. The three-layer architecture of SmallML incorporates transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. 

Layer 1 utilizes SHAP-based techniques to extract useful priors from a substantial dataset of 22,673 public records, transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across 5-50 SMEs, allowing for adaptive shrinkage that balances general patterns with specific characteristics of each entity. Layer 3 offers conformal sets that ensure finite-sample coverage guarantees for uncertainty quantification. 

Validation results on customer churn data show an impressive AUC of 96.7% with only 100 observations per business, representing a significant improvement over traditional methods. With training completed in just 33 minutes on standard hardware, SmallML facilitates enterprise-level predictions for the 33 million U.S. SMEs, effectively bridging a critical gap in AI accessibility and democratization. <div>

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent 99.9% of U.S. businesses yet remain systematically excluded from AI due to a mismatch between their operational scale and modern machine learning's data requirements. This paper introduces SmallML, a Bayesian transfer learning framework achieving enterprise-level prediction accuracy with datasets as small as 50-200 observations.
  We develop a three-layer architecture integrating transfer learning, hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and conformal prediction. Layer 1 extracts informative priors from 22,673 public records using a SHAP-based procedure transferring knowledge from gradient boosting to logistic regression. Layer 2 implements hierarchical pooling across J=5-50 SMEs with adaptive shrinkage, balancing population patterns with entity-specific characteristics. Layer 3 provides conformal sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees P(y in C(x)) >= 1-alpha for distribution-free uncertainty quantification.
  Validation on customer churn data demonstrates 96.7% +/- 4.2% AUC with 100 observations per business -- a +24.2 point improvement over independent logistic regression (72.5% +/- 8.1%), with p < 0.000001. Conformal prediction achieves 92% empirical coverage at 90% target. Training completes in 33 minutes on standard CPU hardware. By enabling enterprise-grade predictions for 33 million U.S. SMEs previously excluded from machine learning, SmallML addresses a critical gap in AI democratization.

<div> Keywords: generative models, curved spaces, Radial Compensation, Balanced-Exponential, likelihoods  

<br><br>Summary: The paper discusses challenges in generative models on curved spaces, notably the issues with exponential maps that have stiff Jacobians, and volume-preserving charts that distort geodesic distances. These methods entangle curvature with model parameters, increasing gradient variance. The authors introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric technique that selects a base density in the tangent space, allowing likelihood to depend solely on geodesic distance from a pole, thereby decoupling parameter meaning from curvature. They extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume, demonstrating that RC offers geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. The work culminates in the derivation of the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, which balances volume distortion and geodesic error. All bExp variants under RC maintain consistent manifold density and Fisher information, with reduced gradient variance and flow cost achieved through smaller dial values. Empirical results show that RC enhances generative model stability across various densities, including VAEs and flows on images, graphs, and proteins. It improves test likelihoods, restores accurate geodesic radii, and mitigates radius blow-ups, making RC-bExp a recommended default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds. <div>

Abstract: Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.

<div> Keywords: archery, machine learning, wearable sensors, motion recognition, stress estimation  

<br><br>Summary:  
In precision sports like archery, athlete performance hinges on biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis tools are costly and intrusive, limiting their application in natural settings. To overcome this challenge, the authors propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that utilizes wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. They developed a wrist-worn device with an accelerometer and a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to collect synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, they introduce a new feature called Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff) and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, achieving an impressive 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals are extracted and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is utilized, yielding 80% accuracy in differentiating high- and low-stress levels. The framework highlights the potential of integrating motion and physiological sensing to gain valuable insights into athletes' performance and mental states, paving the way for intelligent, real-time feedback systems aimed at optimizing training in archery and other precision sports. <div>

Abstract: In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.

<div> Keywords: medication recommendation, dynamic causal reasoning, cross-modal attention, patient states, MIMIC dataset

<br><br>Summary:  
Medication recommendation systems are essential for clinicians to make personalized treatment decisions. Current methods face two main challenges: they often treat medical entities as independent features and rely on static causal relationships that do not adapt to individual patient contexts. To overcome these limitations, this article presents CafeMed, a novel framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for medication recommendation. CafeMed features two innovative components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG), which converts static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights tailored to individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM), which captures the intricate interdependencies among diagnoses and procedures. This design allows CafeMed to model how various medical conditions collaboratively inform treatment decisions while ensuring medication safety. Evaluation using the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrates that CafeMed outperforms existing state-of-the-art methodologies, offering greater accuracy in medication predictions alongside lower rates of drug-drug interactions. The findings highlight that integrating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies results in more personalized and clinically relevant medication recommendations. The code for CafeMed is openly accessible at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed. <div>

Abstract: Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed.

<div> Keywords: Classifier-Free Guidance, CFG-EC, unconditional noise correction, generative models, prompt fidelity<br><br>Summary:  
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used in conditional generative models to improve both prompt fidelity and generation quality by alternating training between conditional and null prompts. However, CFG’s sampling process involves simultaneous outputs of null and conditional prompts, resulting in inconsistent noise estimates compared to training. This inconsistency can degrade image generation quality. To address this, the paper proposes CFG-EC, a correction scheme that can be applied to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC works by realigning the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component, preventing interference between guidance signals. This approach effectively constrains the upper bound of sampling error, resulting in more reliable guidance trajectories. Numerical experiments demonstrate that CFG-EC outperforms standard CFG and CFG++ methods, particularly in settings with low guidance strength. It achieves a significant performance boost in prompt alignment and overall image generation quality. Thus, CFG-EC represents a robust refinement to existing CFG approaches, enabling higher fidelity and more consistent conditional image synthesis. <div>

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.

<br><br>Summary: This article addresses the practicality of deep learning-based localization, focusing on the often-overlooked impact of device configuration changes, such as bandwidth and the number of access points (APs). These variations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), which can hinder the performance of neural networks. To tackle this challenge, the authors introduce Meta-SimGNN, a novel localization system that combines graph neural networks with meta-learning. The system features a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, treating each AP as a graph node to adapt to varying numbers of APs. To enhance reliability, it employs an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction technique that maintains dimension consistency across different configurations like bandwidth and antenna count. Additionally, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy enables the system to quickly adjust to new scenarios by using historical data for model parameter initialization. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-SimGNN significantly outperforms baseline methods in localization generalization and accuracy across various scenarios with commodity WiFi devices. <div>

Abstract: To promote the practicality of deep learning-based localization, existing studies aim to address the issue of scenario dependence through meta-learning. However, these studies primarily focus on variations in environmental layouts while overlooking the impact of changes in device configurations, such as bandwidth, the number of access points (APs), and the number of antennas used. Unlike environmental changes, variations in device configurations affect the dimensionality of channel state information (CSI), thereby compromising neural network usability. To address this issue, we propose Meta-SimGNN, a novel WiFi localization system that integrates graph neural networks with meta-learning to improve localization generalization and robustness. First, we introduce a fine-grained CSI graph construction scheme, where each AP is treated as a graph node, allowing for adaptability to changes in the number of APs. To structure the features of each node, we propose an amplitude-phase fusion method and a feature extraction method. The former utilizes both amplitude and phase to construct CSI images, enhancing data reliability, while the latter extracts dimension-consistent features to address variations in bandwidth and the number of antennas. Second, a similarity-guided meta-learning strategy is developed to enhance adaptability in diverse scenarios. The initial model parameters for the fine-tuning stage are determined by comparing the similarity between the new scenario and historical scenarios, facilitating rapid adaptation of the model to the new localization scenario. Extensive experimental results over commodity WiFi devices in different scenarios show that Meta-SimGNN outperforms the baseline methods in terms of localization generalization and accuracy.

<div> Keywords: differential privacy, auditing, machine learning, observational framework, label privacy

<br><br>Summary: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is crucial for assessing privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Traditional auditing methods often require modifications to the training dataset, like injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples, which can be resource-intensive and complicated to implement. This paper introduces a novel observational auditing framework that utilizes the inherent randomness within data distributions, allowing for privacy evaluations without altering the original dataset. The proposed approach broadens the scope of privacy auditing, extending it beyond conventional membership inference to include protected attributes, with labels being a specific focus. This addresses significant gaps in existing auditing techniques. The authors provide a theoretical foundation for their methodology and conduct experiments on well-known datasets, including Criteo and CIFAR-10, to showcase its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This research paves the way for more practical privacy auditing solutions suitable for large-scale production environments, making it easier to evaluate privacy risks without the extensive engineering efforts typically required by existing methods. Overall, this work contributes to enhancing the reliability of privacy assessments in machine learning applications. <div>

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.

<div> Keywords: Mixture-of-Experts, MoE-SpeQ, inference, expert offloading, data movement  

<br><br>Summary: The paper addresses the significant memory challenges posed by state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models during inference, often exceeding a single accelerator's capacity. Offloading experts to host memory is a common strategy but results in an I/O bottleneck due to synchronous data-dependent expert selection, negatively impacting performance. The authors propose MoE-SpeQ, a novel inference system that combines speculative execution with expert offloading. By utilizing a small on-device draft model, MoE-SpeQ can predict the required experts for future tokens, allowing a runtime orchestrator to prefetch data from host memory. This prefetching process effectively overlaps the costly I/O operations with useful computations, thus hiding latency from the critical execution path. To further enhance performance, an adaptive governor is implemented, utilizing an Amortization Roofline Model to dynamically optimize the speculation strategy based on available hardware. Experimental results on memory-constrained devices demonstrate that MoE-SpeQ achieves up to a 2.34x speedup over existing offloading frameworks for the Phi-MoE model. The study establishes a new method for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited settings, facilitating MoE inference on typical hardware. <div>

Abstract: The immense memory requirements of state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models present a significant challenge for inference, often exceeding the capacity of a single accelerator. While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.
  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework. Our work establishes a new, principled approach for managing data-dependent memory access in resource-limited environments, making MoE inference more accessible on commodity hardware.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: subjectivity, soft-label training, epistemic uncertainty, annotation distribution, machine learning<br><br>Summary: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where human annotators provide diverse labels rather than a single definitive answer. Traditionally, these varied labels are collapsed into single hard labels, which ignores the underlying uncertainty and variability of human judgment. The authors argue that this conventional practice is epistemically misaligned because it forces models to express unwarranted confidence on ambiguous data. Instead, they propose treating the entire annotation distribution—reflecting the range of human opinions—as the ground truth. By training models on these soft labels, the models better preserve epistemic uncertainty in their predictions. Empirical results across both vision and NLP tasks show that soft-label training produces outputs with 32% lower Kullback-Leibler divergence from human annotation distributions and a 61% stronger correlation between the model’s predictive entropy and the annotation entropy compared to hard-label training. Importantly, this approach achieves comparable accuracy to conventional single-label training. Their work reframes annotation distributions not as noise to be aggregated away but as meaningful representations of intrinsic ambiguity that models should learn to reproduce, ultimately enhancing model reliability and interpretability in subjective tasks. <div>

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects on time-to-event outcomes from observational data is particularly challenging due to censoring, limited sample sizes, and non-random treatment assignment. The need for answering such "when-if" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts. Given the broad relevance of survival analysis across medicine, economics, and public policy, our framework offers a general and interpretable tool for counterfactual survival inference using observational data.

<div> Keywords: fair workload allocation, multi-agent reinforcement learning, generalized Nash equilibrium, healthcare systems, adaptive constraint enforcement  

<br><br>Summary:  
This article addresses the critical need for fair workload allocation among multiple agents in learning-enabled healthcare worker settings. It critiques existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods that rely on post hoc reward shaping to promote fairness, which lacks self-enforceable measures during runtime. The authors propose a novel framework, Fair-GNE, modelled as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game, where self-interested agents enter collective decision-making that promotes equity. This framework ensures that no agent can independently enhance their utility by altering their decisions, thus achieving a safe and efficient group policy. The hypothesis is tested using a custom high-fidelity resuscitation simulator, revealing that Fair-GNE significantly enhances workload balance compared to fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs. 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while sustaining an impressive 86% task success rate. The results underscore the importance of their formulations and evaluation metrics, showcasing how innovative equilibrium-seeking methodologies can lead to principled fairness enforcement in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems. <div>

Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, biases, bias-Identification Framework, gender bias, racial bias

<br><br>Summary: This study examines the biases inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) and underscores the importance of identifying and mitigating these biases to ensure fair outputs. The authors evaluated multiple generative models, including BERT and GPT 3.5, using bias-specific benchmarks like StereoSet and CrowSPairs. They introduced an automated Bias-Identification Framework targeting social biases related to gender, race, profession, and religion through a dual approach to detect both explicit and implicit biases. Findings revealed that while fine-tuned models struggled with gender bias, they performed well in recognizing and avoiding racial biases. However, the models showed a tendency to over-rely on keywords. To explore implicit biases, a Bag-of-Words analysis was employed, revealing signs of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To enhance model performance, the researchers implemented a strategy involving fine-tuning through prompting techniques and data augmentation, which resulted in improved adaptability during cross-dataset testing. Significantly, the fine-tuned models achieved performance gains of up to 20% on implicit bias benchmarks, indicating the effectiveness of their mitigation strategies in addressing biases in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit explicit and implicit biases from their training datasets. Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. The fine-tuned models exhibited promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

<div> Keywords: Signed Graph Neural Networks, Graph Unlearning, Privacy Protection, Sociological Theories, Certified Unlearning  

<br><br>Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of unlearning in Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), which model relationships with positive and negative edges. Existing graph unlearning methods are tailored for conventional graphs and fail to account for the unique heterogeneous and signed nature of SGNNs, resulting in loss of critical sign information and decreased model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), a novel framework that guarantees privacy protection while respecting the sociological principles inherent in signed graphs. CSGU follows a three-stage process: first, it efficiently identifies minimal influenced neighborhoods through the analysis of triangular graph structures, which are key to capturing signed interactions. Second, it applies sociological theories to assess node importance, enabling optimal allocation of the privacy budget across the graph. Third, CSGU performs importance-weighted parameter updates to ensure certified modifications with minimal degradation in model utility. Experimental results demonstrate that CSGU outperforms prior methods by delivering superior utility retention and more effective unlearning on SGNNs, validating the approach as a state-of-the-art solution for privacy-preserving learning in signed graph settings. <div>

Abstract: Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, safety robustness, N-GLARE, latent representations, JSS metric

<br><br>Summary: The safety robustness evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for their effective deployment. Traditional Red Teaming methods, which involve online generation and black-box output analysis, have significant drawbacks, including high costs and feedback latency. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator), which evaluates LLM safety directly through the model's latent representations without necessitating full text generation. N-GLARE focuses on analyzing the hidden layer dynamics via the Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory (APT) of latent representations and introduces a new metric, Jensen-Shannon Separability (JSS). Experimental results, encompassing over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies, indicate that the JSS metric is highly consistent with safety evaluations derived from traditional Red Teaming methodologies. Notably, N-GLARE achieves this output-free evaluation with costs amounting to less than 1% of the token and runtime expenses associated with standard red teaming tests. This advancement allows for efficient and timely diagnostics following the training of new models, thereby facilitating agile safety assessments. <div>

Abstract: Evaluating the safety robustness of LLMs is critical for their deployment. However, mainstream Red Teaming methods rely on online generation and black-box output analysis. These approaches are not only costly but also suffer from feedback latency, making them unsuitable for agile diagnostics after training a new model. To address this, we propose N-GLARE (A Non-Generative, Latent Representation-Efficient LLM Safety Evaluator). N-GLARE operates entirely on the model's latent representations, bypassing the need for full text generation. It characterizes hidden layer dynamics by analyzing the APT (Angular-Probabilistic Trajectory) of latent representations and introducing the JSS (Jensen-Shannon Separability) metric. Experiments on over 40 models and 20 red teaming strategies demonstrate that the JSS metric exhibits high consistency with the safety rankings derived from Red Teaming. N-GLARE reproduces the discriminative trends of large-scale red-teaming tests at less than 1\% of the token cost and the runtime cost, providing an efficient output-free evaluation proxy for real-time diagnostics.

Abstract: Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25{\deg} spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.

Abstract: We simplify space binding by focusing on two core components, a single encoder per modality and high-quality data; enabling training state-of-the-art models on a single GPU in a few hours as opposed to multiple days. We present EBind, an Easy, data-centric, and parameter-efficient method to Bind the embedding spaces of multiple contrastive models. We demonstrate that a simple 1.8B-parameter image-text-video-audio-3D model can outperform models 4 to 17x the size. The key to achieving this is a carefully curated dataset of three complementary data sources: i) 6.7M fully-automated multimodal quintuples sourced via SOTA retrieval models, ii) 1M diverse, semi-automated triples annotated by humans as negative, partial, or positive matches, and iii) 3.4M pre-existing captioned data items. We use 13 different evaluations to demonstrate the value of each data source. Due to limitations with existing benchmarks, we further introduce the first high-quality, consensus-annotated zero-shot classification benchmark between audio and PCs. In contrast to related work, we will open-source our code, model weights, and datasets.

Abstract: World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.

Abstract: Recent work in deep learning has opened new possibilities for solving classical algorithmic tasks using end-to-end learned models. In this work, we investigate the fundamental task of solving linear systems, particularly those that are ill-conditioned. Existing numerical methods for ill-conditioned systems often require careful parameter tuning, preconditioning, or domain-specific expertise to ensure accuracy and stability. In this work, we propose Algebraformer, a Transformer-based architecture that learns to solve linear systems end-to-end, even in the presence of severe ill-conditioning. Our model leverages a novel encoding scheme that enables efficient representation of matrix and vector inputs, with a memory complexity of $O(n^2)$, supporting scalable inference. We demonstrate its effectiveness on application-driven linear problems, including interpolation tasks from spectral methods for boundary value problems and acceleration of the Newton method. Algebraformer achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational overhead at test time, demonstrating that general-purpose neural architectures can effectively reduce complexity in traditional scientific computing pipelines.

Abstract: Vessel trajectory prediction is fundamental to intelligent maritime systems. Within this domain, short-term prediction of rapid behavioral changes in complex maritime environments has established multimodal trajectory prediction (MTP) as a promising research area. However, existing vessel MTP methods suffer from limited scenario applicability and insufficient explainability. To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency. Experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) datasets demonstrates our method's broad applicability across diverse scenarios, achieving significant improvements in both ADE and FDE. Furthermore, our method improves explainability by explicitly revealing the navigational intentions underlying each predicted trajectory.

Abstract: Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.

Abstract: Phonocardiogram (PCG) analysis is vital for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the scarcity of labeled pathological data hinders the capability of AI systems. To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata. Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fr\'echet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists. Augmenting diagnostic models with our synthetic data improves the accuracy of rare disease classification by 11.3\%. H-LDM establishes a new direction for data augmentation in cardiac diagnostics, bridging data scarcity with interpretable clinical insights.

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.

Abstract: As machine learning applications grow increasingly ubiquitous and complex, they face an increasing set of requirements beyond accuracy. The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.

<title>Enforcing hidden physics in physics-informed neural networks</title>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a new paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical laws into the learning process of neural networks. However, despite their foundational role, the hidden irreversibility implied by the Second Law of Thermodynamics is often neglected during training, leading to unphysical solutions or even training failures in conventional PINNs. In this paper, we identify this critical gap and introduce a simple, generalized, yet robust irreversibility-regularized strategy that enforces hidden physical laws as soft constraints during training. This approach ensures that the learned solutions consistently respect the intrinsic one-way nature of irreversible physical processes. Across a wide range of benchmarks spanning traveling wave propagation, steady combustion, ice melting, corrosion evolution, and crack propagation, we demonstrate that our regularization scheme reduces predictive errors by more than an order of magnitude, while requiring only minimal modification to existing PINN frameworks. We believe that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of PDE-governed physical systems and will have significant impact within the scientific machine learning community.

<title>Watch Out for the Lifespan: Evaluating Backdoor Attacks Against Federated Model Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Large models adaptation through Federated Learning (FL) addresses a wide range of use cases and is enabled by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, this distributed learning paradigm faces several security threats, particularly to its integrity, such as backdoor attacks that aim to inject malicious behavior during the local training steps of certain clients. We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower. Importantly, our work highlights evaluation issues of backdoor attacks against FL and contributes to the development of more robust and fair evaluations of backdoor attacks, enhancing the reliability of risk assessments for critical FL systems. Our code is publicly available.

<title>Toward Robust and Harmonious Adaptation for Cross-modal Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Recently, the general-to-customized paradigm has emerged as the dominant approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR), which reconciles the distribution shift problem between the source domain and the target domain. However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.

Abstract: Autonomous migration is essential for the function of immune cells such as neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in diverse diseases. Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation. However, ComplexEye and similar high-throughput imaging platforms generate data at an exponential rate, imposing substantial burdens on storage and transmission. To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression. FlowRoI operates with high computational efficiency, achieving runtimes comparable to standard JPEG2000 and reaching an average throughput of about 30 frames per second on a modern laptop equipped with an Intel i7-1255U CPU. In terms of image quality, FlowRoI yields higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in cellular regions and achieves 2.0-2.2x higher compression rates at matched PSNR compared to standard JPEG2000.

<title>MiAD: Mirage Atom Diffusion for De Novo Crystal Generation</title>

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.

<title>Nonparametric estimation of conditional probability distributions using a generative approach based on conditional push-forward neural networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2511.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce conditional push-forward neural networks (CPFN), a generative framework for conditional distribution estimation. Instead of directly modeling the conditional density $f_{Y|X}$, CPFN learns a stochastic map $\varphi=\varphi(x,u)$ such that $\varphi(x,U)$ and $Y|X=x$ follow approximately the same law, with $U$ a suitable random vector of pre-defined latent variables. This enables efficient conditional sampling and straightforward estimation of conditional statistics through Monte Carlo methods. The model is trained via an objective function derived from a Kullback-Leibler formulation, without requiring invertibility or adversarial training. We establish a near-asymptotic consistency result and demonstrate experimentally that CPFN can achieve performance competitive with, or even superior to, state-of-the-art methods, including kernel estimators, tree-based algorithms, and popular deep learning techniques, all while remaining lightweight and easy to train.

<title>nnterp: A Standardized Interface for Mechanistic Interpretability of Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2511.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.

Abstract: These notes provide a self-contained introduction to kernel methods and their geometric foundations in machine learning. Starting from the construction of Hilbert spaces, we develop the theory of positive definite kernels, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), and Hilbert-Schmidt operators, emphasizing their role in statistical estimation and representation of probability measures. Classical concepts such as covariance, regression, and information measures are revisited through the lens of Hilbert space geometry. We also introduce kernel density estimation, kernel embeddings of distributions, and the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The exposition is designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced topics, including Gaussian processes, kernel Bayesian inference, and functional analytic approaches to modern machine learning.

<title>Towards Stable and Structured Time Series Generation with Perturbation-Aware Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: The growth of million-token LLMs exposes the scalability limits of inference systems, where the KVCache dominates memory usage and data transfer overhead. Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%. Our results highlight that algorithm-system co-design is essential for memory-constrained LLM inference on modern GPU platforms. We open source CLO at https://github.com/CommediaJW/CLO.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have recently emerged as promising approaches for peptide binder design. Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation. Experiments on side chain packing, reverse folding, and binder design tasks demonstrate the strong potential of PepBFN in computational peptide design.

<title>MissHDD: Hybrid Deterministic Diffusion for Hetrogeneous Incomplete Data Imputation</title>

Abstract: Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.
  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.
  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used for the visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data due to their ability to project datasets of high-dimensional points onto the 2D plane. However, projecting datasets in lower dimensions often entails some distortion, which is not necessarily easy to recognize but can lead users to misleading conclusions. Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.

Abstract: Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a promising method for editing pre-trained \textit{open-vocabulary} models, offering a cost-effective alternative to standard multi-task fine-tuning. However, despite the abundance of \textit{closed-vocabulary} models that are not pre-trained with language supervision, applying task arithmetic to these models remains unexplored. In this paper, we deploy and study task addition in closed-vocabulary image classification models. We consider different pre-training schemes and find that \textit{weight disentanglement} -- the property enabling task arithmetic -- is a general consequence of pre-training, as it appears in different pre-trained closed-vocabulary models. In fact, we find that pre-trained closed-vocabulary vision transformers can also be edited with task arithmetic, achieving high task addition performance and enabling the efficient deployment of multi-task models. Finally, we demonstrate that simple linear probing is a competitive baseline to task addition. Overall, our findings expand the applicability of task arithmetic to a broader class of pre-trained models and open the way for more efficient use of pre-trained models in diverse settings.

Abstract: Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.

Abstract: Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.

Abstract: Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of "1" 49% of the time produces an answer of "0" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.

<title>Adapformer: Adaptive Channel Management for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.

Abstract: Smoking continues to be a major preventable cause of death worldwide, affecting millions through damage to the heart, metabolism, liver, and kidneys. However, current medical screening methods often miss the early warning signs of smoking-related health problems, leading to late-stage diagnoses when treatment options become limited. This study presents a systematic comparative evaluation of machine learning approaches for smoking-related health risk assessment, emphasizing clinical interpretability and practical deployment over algorithmic innovation. We analyzed health screening data from 55,691 individuals, examining various health indicators, including body measurements, blood tests, and demographic information. We tested three advanced prediction algorithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM - to determine which could most accurately identify people at high risk. This study employed a cross-sectional design to classify current smoking status based on health screening biomarkers, not to predict future disease development. Our Random Forest model performed best, achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.926, meaning it could reliably distinguish between high-risk and lower-risk individuals. Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to understand what the model was detecting, we found that key health markers played crucial roles in prediction: blood pressure levels, triglyceride concentrations, liver enzyme readings, and kidney function indicators (serum creatinine) were the strongest signals of declining health in smokers.

<title>\textit{FLARE}: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE

<title>AdamHD: Decoupled Huber Decay Regularization for Language Model Pre-Training</title>

Abstract: Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordinates. We propose AdamHuberDecay, a drop-in replacement for AdamW that substitutes the $\ell_2$ penalty with a decoupled smooth Huber regularizer. The resulting update decays parameters quadratically while their magnitude remains below a threshold $\delta$, and linearly ($\ell_1$-like) once they exceed $\delta$, yielding (i) bounded regularization gradients, (ii) invariance to per-coordinate second-moment rescaling, and (iii) stronger sparsity pressure on overgrown weights.
  We derive the closed-form decoupled Huber decay step and show how to integrate it with any Adam-family optimizer at $O(1)$ extra cost. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 and GPT-3 pre-training demonstrate that AdamHuberDecay (a) converges 10-15% faster in wall-clock time, (b) reduces validation perplexity by up to 4 points, (c) delivers performance improvements of 2.5-4.7% across downstream tasks, and (d) yields visibly sparser weight histograms that translate into 20-30% memory savings after magnitude pruning, without tuning the decay coefficient beyond the default grid used for AdamW. Ablations confirm robustness to outlier gradients and large-batch regimes, together with theoretical analyses that bound the expected parameter norm under noisy updates. AdamHuberDecay therefore provides a simple, principled path toward more efficient and resilient training of next-generation foundational generative transformers.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, inefficient, and driven by trial and error. To alleviate this issue of lacking labeled data, we present a learning framework integrating LLMs with active learning for unlabeled dataset (LAUD). LAUD mitigates the cold-start problem by constructing an initial label set with zero-shot learning. Experimental results show that LLMs derived from LAUD outperform LLMs with zero-shot or few-shot learning on commodity name classification tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LAUD.

Abstract: Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP model that captures the dynamics of ratings over time while additionally accounting for review heterogeneity. Based on 121,123 ratings from Yelp, we compare the predictive power of different rating aggregation methods in predicting future ratings, thereby finding that the GP model is considerably more accurate and reduces the mean absolute error by 10.2% compared to the sample mean. Our findings have important implications for marketing practitioners and customers. By moving beyond means, designers of online reputation systems can display more informative and adaptive aggregated rating scores that are accurate signals of expected customer satisfaction.

<title>Measuring AI Progress in Drug Discovery: A Reproducible Leaderboard for the Tox21 Challenge</title>

Abstract: Deep learning's rise since the early 2010s has transformed fields like computer vision and natural language processing and strongly influenced biomedical research. For drug discovery specifically, a key inflection - akin to vision's "ImageNet moment" - arrived in 2015, when deep neural networks surpassed traditional approaches on the Tox21 Data Challenge. This milestone accelerated the adoption of deep learning across the pharmaceutical industry, and today most major companies have integrated these methods into their research pipelines. After the Tox21 Challenge concluded, its dataset was included in several established benchmarks, such as MoleculeNet and the Open Graph Benchmark. However, during these integrations, the dataset was altered and labels were imputed or manufactured, resulting in a loss of comparability across studies. Consequently, the extent to which bioactivity and toxicity prediction methods have improved over the past decade remains unclear. To this end, we introduce a reproducible leaderboard, hosted on Hugging Face with the original Tox21 Challenge dataset, together with a set of baseline and representative methods. The current version of the leaderboard indicates that the original Tox21 winner - the ensemble-based DeepTox method - and the descriptor-based self-normalizing neural networks introduced in 2017, continue to perform competitively and rank among the top methods for toxicity prediction, leaving it unclear whether substantial progress in toxicity prediction has been achieved over the past decade. As part of this work, we make all baselines and evaluated models publicly accessible for inference via standardized API calls to Hugging Face Spaces.

Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.

<title>SparseST: Exploiting Data Sparsity in Spatiotemporal Modeling and Prediction</title>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal data mining (STDM) has a wide range of applications in various complex physical systems (CPS), i.e., transportation, manufacturing, healthcare, etc. Among all the proposed methods, the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) has proved to be generalizable and extendable in different applications and has multiple variants achieving state-of-the-art performance in various STDM applications. However, ConvLSTM and its variants are computationally expensive, which makes them inapplicable in edge devices with limited computational resources. With the emerging need for edge computing in CPS, efficient AI is essential to reduce the computational cost while preserving the model performance. Common methods of efficient AI are developed to reduce redundancy in model capacity (i.e., model pruning, compression, etc.). However, spatiotemporal data mining naturally requires extensive model capacity, as the embedded dependencies in spatiotemporal data are complex and hard to capture, which limits the model redundancy. Instead, there is a fairly high level of data and feature redundancy that introduces an unnecessary computational burden, which has been largely overlooked in existing research. Therefore, we developed a novel framework SparseST, that pioneered in exploiting data sparsity to develop an efficient spatiotemporal model. In addition, we explore and approximate the Pareto front between model performance and computational efficiency by designing a multi-objective composite loss function, which provides a practical guide for practitioners to adjust the model according to computational resource constraints and the performance requirements of downstream tasks.

Abstract: We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $\pi^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $\pi^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate.

Abstract: Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.

Abstract: We analyze an algorithm for assigning weights prior to scalarization in discrete multi-objective problems arising from data analysis. The algorithm evolves the weights (the relevance of features) by a replicator-type dynamic on the standard simplex, with update indices computed from a normalized data matrix. We prove that the resulting sequence converges globally to a unique interior equilibrium, yielding non-degenerate limiting weights. The method, originally inspired by evolutionary game theory, differs from standard weighting schemes in that it is analytically tractable with provable convergence.

Abstract: Input data preprocessing is a common bottleneck when concurrently training multimedia machine learning (ML) models in modern systems. To alleviate these bottlenecks and reduce the training time for concurrent jobs, we present Seneca, a data loading system that optimizes cache partitioning and data sampling for the data storage and ingestion (DSI) pipeline. The design of Seneca contains two key techniques. First, Seneca uses a performance model for the data pipeline to optimally partition the cache for three different forms of data (encoded, decoded, and augmented). Second, Seneca opportunistically serves cached data over uncached ones during random batch sampling so that concurrent jobs benefit from each other. We implement Seneca by modifying PyTorch and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it against several state-of-the-art caching systems for DNN training. Seneca reduces the makespan by 45.23% compared to PyTorch and increases data processing throughput by up to 3.45x compared to the next best dataloader.

<title>DualLaguerreNet: A Decoupled Spectral Filter GNN and the Uncovering of the Flexibility-Stability Trade-off</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on spectral filters, such as the Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter (AOPF) class (e.g., LaguerreNet), have shown promise in unifying the solutions for heterophily and over-smoothing. However, these single-filter models suffer from a "compromise" problem, as their single adaptive parameter (e.g., alpha) must learn a suboptimal, averaged response across the entire graph spectrum. In this paper, we propose DualLaguerreNet, a novel GNN architecture that solves this by introducing "Decoupled Spectral Flexibility." DualLaguerreNet splits the graph Laplacian into two operators, L_low (low-frequency) and L_high (high-frequency), and learns two independent, adaptive Laguerre polynomial filters, parameterized by alpha_1 and alpha_2, respectively. This work, however, uncovers a deeper finding. While our experiments show DualLaguerreNet's flexibility allows it to achieve state-of-the-art results on complex heterophilic tasks (outperforming LaguerreNet), it simultaneously underperforms on simpler, homophilic tasks. We identify this as a fundamental "Flexibility-Stability Trade-off". The increased parameterization (2x filter parameters and 2x model parameters) leads to overfitting on simple tasks, demonstrating that the "compromise" of simpler models acts as a crucial regularizer. This paper presents a new SOTA architecture for heterophily while providing a critical analysis of the bias-variance trade-off inherent in adaptive GNN filter design.

Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operating in the canonical [-1, 1] domain (like ChebyNet and its adaptive generalization, L-JacobiNet) face a fundamental Flexibility-Stability Trade-off. Our previous work revealed a critical puzzle: the 2-parameter adaptive L-JacobiNet often suffered from high variance and was surprisingly outperformed by the 0-parameter, stabilized-static S-JacobiNet. This suggested that stabilization was more critical than adaptation in this domain. In this paper, we propose \textbf{GegenbauerNet}, a novel GNN filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomials, to find the Optimal Compromise in this trade-off. By enforcing symmetry (alpha=beta) but allowing a single shape parameter (lambda) to be learned, GegenbauerNet limits flexibility (variance) while escaping the fixed bias of S-JacobiNet. We demonstrate that GegenbauerNet (1-parameter) achieves superior performance in the key local filtering regime (K=2 on heterophilic graphs) where overfitting is minimal, validating the hypothesis that a controlled, symmetric degree of freedom is optimal. Furthermore, our comprehensive K-ablation study across homophilic and heterophilic graphs, using 7 diverse datasets, clarifies the domain's behavior: the fully adaptive L-JacobiNet maintains the highest performance on high-K filtering tasks, showing the value of maximum flexibility when regularization is managed. This study provides crucial design principles for GNN developers, showing that in the [-1, 1] spectral domain, the optimal filter depends critically on the target locality (K) and the acceptable level of design bias.

<title>Principled Coarse-Grained Acceptance for Speculative Decoding in Speech</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates autoregressive speech generation by letting a fast draft model propose tokens that a larger target model verifies. However, for speech LLMs that generate acoustic tokens, exact token matching is overly restrictive: many discrete tokens are acoustically or semantically interchangeable, reducing acceptance rates and limiting speedups. We introduce Principled Coarse-Graining (PCG), which verifies proposals at the level of Acoustic Similarity Groups (ASGs) derived from the target model's embedding space. By splitting each token's probability mass across the overlapping groups that contain it, we define an overlap-aware coarse-grained distribution and perform rejection sampling on the resulting group variable. This yields an exactness guarantee at the group level while allowing the accepted draft token to stand in for any member of the group in practice. On LibriTTS, PCG increases acceptance and throughput relative to standard speculative decoding and prior speech-specific relaxations while maintaining intelligibility and speaker similarity. These results suggest acoustically aware, group-level acceptance as a simple and general way to accelerate speech token generation while maintaining speech quality.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a "next-scale-time prediction" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.

Abstract: This study presents a novel deep learning approach aimed at enhancing stochastic Gust Load Alleviation (GLA) specifically for compliant wings. The approach incorporates the concept of smooth wing camber variation, where the camber of the wing's chord is actively adjusted during flight using a control signal to achieve the desired aerodynamic loading. The proposed method employs a deep learning-based model predictive controller designed for probability density shaping. This controller effectively solves the probability density evolution equation through a custom Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and utilizes Automatic Differentiation for Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization. Comprehensive numerical simulations were conducted on a compliant wing (CW) model, evaluating performance of the proposed approach against stochastic gust profiles. The evaluation involved stochastic aerodynamic loads generated from Band-Limited White Noise (BLWN) and Dryden gust models. The evaluation were conducted for two distinct Compliant Chord Fractions (CCF). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed probability density shaping model predictive control in alleviating stochastic gust load and reducing wing tip deflection.

Abstract: This paper implements deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for spacecraft reorientation control with a single pointing keep-out zone. The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm is adopted to handle continuous state and action space. A new state representation is designed to explicitly include a compact representation of the attitude constraint zone. The reward function is formulated to achieve the control objective while enforcing the attitude constraint. A curriculum learning approach is used for the agent training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based method for spacecraft pointing-constrained attitude control.

Abstract: Although LLM training is typically centralized with high-bandwidth interconnects and large compute budgets, emerging methods target communication-constrained training in distributed environments. The model trade-offs introduced by this shift remain underexplored, and our goal is to study them.
  We use the open-source nanochat project, a compact 8K-line full-stack ChatGPT-like implementation containing tokenization, pretraining, fine-tuning, and serving, as a controlled baseline. We implement the DiLoCo algorithm as a lightweight wrapper over nanochat's training loop, performing multiple local steps per worker before synchronization with an outer optimizer, effectively reducing communication by orders of magnitude. This inner-outer training is compared against a standard data-parallel (DDP) setup. Because nanochat is small and inspectable, it enables controlled pipeline adaptations and allows direct comparison with the conventional centralized baseline.
  DiLoCo achieves stable convergence and competitive loss in pretraining but yields worse MMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval scores after mid-training and SFT. We discover that using DiLoCo-pretrained weights and running mid- and post-training with DDP fails to recover performance, revealing irreversible representation drift from asynchronous updates that impairs downstream alignment. We provide this implementation as an official fork of nanochat on GitHub.

Abstract: We study how two information feeds, a closed-form Markov estimator of residual sojourn and an online trained actor-critic, affect reneging and jockeying in a dual M/M/1 system. Analytically, for unequal service rates and total-time patience, we show that total wait grows linearly so abandonment is inevitable and the probability of a successful jockey vanishes as the backlog approaches towards infinity. Furthermore, under a mild sub-linear error condition both information models yield the same asymptotic limits (robustness). We empirically validate these limits and quantify finite backlog differences. Our findings show that learned and analytic feeds produce different delays, reneging rates and transient jockeying behavior at practical sizes, but converge to the same asymptotic outcome implied by our theory. The results characterize when value-of-information matters (finite regimes) and when it does not (asymptotics), informing lightweight telemetry and decision-logic design for low-cost, jockeying-aware systems.

<title>Known Meets Unknown: Mitigating Overconfidence in Open Set Recognition</title>

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

Abstract: Mobile devices increasingly require the parallel execution of several computing tasks offloaded at the wireless edge. Existing communication systems only support parallel transmissions at the bit level, which fundamentally limits the number of tasks that can be concurrently processed. To address this bottleneck, this paper introduces the new concept of Semantic Multiplexing. Our approach shifts stream multiplexing from bits to tasks by merging multiple task-related compressed representations into a single semantic representation. As such, Semantic Multiplexing can multiplex more tasks than the number of physical channels without adding antennas or widening bandwidth by extending the effective degrees of freedom at the semantic layer, without contradicting Shannon capacity rules. We have prototyped Semantic Multiplexing on an experimental testbed with Jetson Orin Nano and millimeter-wave software-defined radios and tested its performance on image classification and sentiment analysis while comparing to several existing baselines in semantic communications. Our experiments demonstrate that Semantic Multiplexing allows jointly processing multiple tasks at the semantic level while maintaining sufficient task accuracy. For example, image classification accuracy drops by less than 4% when increasing from 2 to 8 the number of tasks multiplexed over a 4$\times$4 channel. Semantic Multiplexing reduces latency, energy consumption, and communication load respectively by up to 8$\times$, 25$\times$, and 54$\times$ compared to the baselines while keeping comparable performance. We pledge to publicly share the complete software codebase and the collected datasets for reproducibility.

<title>CellStream: Dynamical Optimal Transport Informed Embeddings for Reconstructing Cellular Trajectories from Snapshots Data</title>

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), especially temporally resolved datasets, enables genome-wide profiling of gene expression dynamics at single-cell resolution across discrete time points. However, current technologies provide only sparse, static snapshots of cell states and are inherently influenced by technical noise, complicating the inference and representation of continuous transcriptional dynamics. Although embedding methods can reduce dimensionality and mitigate technical noise, the majority of existing approaches typically treat trajectory inference separately from embedding construction, often neglecting temporal structure. To address this challenge, here we introduce CellStream, a novel deep learning framework that jointly learns embedding and cellular dynamics from single-cell snapshot data by integrating an autoencoder with unbalanced dynamical optimal transport. Compared to existing methods, CellStream generates dynamics-informed embeddings that robustly capture temporal developmental processes while maintaining high consistency with the underlying data manifold. We demonstrate CellStream's effectiveness on both simulated datasets and real scRNA-seq data, including spatial transcriptomics. Our experiments indicate significant quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art methods in representing cellular trajectories with enhanced temporal coherence and reduced noise sensitivity. Overall, CellStream provides a new tool for learning and representing continuous streams from the noisy, static snapshots of single-cell gene expression.

Abstract: Proteins perform essential biological functions, and accurate classification of their sequences is critical for understanding structure-function relationships, enzyme mechanisms, and molecular interactions. This study presents a deep learning-based framework for functional group classification of protein sequences derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Four architectures were implemented: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), CNN-BiLSTM hybrid, and CNN with Attention. Each model was trained using k-mer integer encoding to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Among these, the CNN achieved the highest validation accuracy of 91.8%, demonstrating the effectiveness of localized motif detection. Explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients, were applied to interpret model predictions and identify biologically meaningful sequence motifs. The discovered motifs, enriched in histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and lysine, represent amino acid residues commonly found in catalytic and metal-binding regions of transferase enzymes. These findings highlight that deep learning models can uncover functionally relevant biochemical signatures, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and biological interpretability in protein sequence analysis.

Abstract: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has posed a major global health challenge for decades, and forecasting HIV diagnoses continues to be a critical area of research. However, capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies of HIV transmission remains challenging. Conventional Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) models rely on a fixed binary adjacency matrix that only encodes geographic adjacency, which is unable to represent interactions between non-contiguous counties. Our study proposes a deep learning architecture Mobility-Aware Transformer-Message Passing Neural Network (MAT-MPNN) framework to predict county-level HIV diagnosis rates across California, Florida, and the New England region. The model combines temporal features extracted by a Transformer encoder with spatial relationships captured through a Mobility Graph Generator (MGG). The MGG improves conventional adjacency matrices by combining geographic and demographic information. Compared with the best-performing hybrid baseline, the Transformer MPNN model, MAT-MPNN reduced the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) by 27.9% in Florida, 39.1% in California, and 12.5% in New England, and improved the Predictive Model Choice Criterion (PMCC) by 7.7%, 3.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. MAT-MPNN also achieved better results than the Spatially Varying Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model in Florida and New England, with comparable performance in California. These results demonstrate that applying mobility-aware dynamic spatial structures substantially enhances predictive accuracy and calibration in spatiotemporal epidemiological prediction.

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Abstract: A classifier using byte n-grams as features is the only approach we have found fast enough to meet requirements in size (sub 2 MB), speed (multiple GB/s), and latency (sub 10 ms) for deployment in numerous malware detection scenarios. However, we've consistently found that 6-8 grams achieve the best accuracy on our production deployments but have been unable to deploy regularly updated models due to the high cost of finding the top-k most frequent n-grams over terabytes of executable programs. Because the Zipfian distribution well models the distribution of n-grams, we exploit its properties to develop a new top-k n-gram extractor that is up to $35\times$ faster than the previous best alternative. Using our new Zipf-Gramming algorithm, we are able to scale up our production training set and obtain up to 30\% improvement in AUC at detecting new malware. We show theoretically and empirically that our approach will select the top-k items with little error and the interplay between theory and engineering required to achieve these results.

Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (150) using the Friedman test, significantly outperforming L-SHADE (229) and standard DE (305) in the dimension-variant trials. QUASAR also proves computationally efficient, with run times averaging $1.4 \text{x}$ faster than DE and $7.8 \text{x}$ faster than L-SHADE ($p \ll 0.001$) in the population-variant trials.
  Building upon Differential Evolution (DE), QUASAR introduces a highly stochastic architecture to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation. Inspired by the probabilistic behavior of quantum particles in a stellar core, the algorithm implements three primary components that augment standard DE mechanisms: 1) probabilistically selected mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying reinitialization that leverages a covariance matrix of the best solutions to introduce high-quality genetic diversity.
  QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, user-friendly optimizer for complex high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Low-rank recurrent neural networks (lrRNNs) are a class of models that uncover low-dimensional latent dynamics underlying neural population activity. Although their functional connectivity is low-rank, it lacks disentanglement interpretations, making it difficult to assign distinct computational roles to different latent dimensions. To address this, we propose the Disentangled Recurrent Neural Network (DisRNN), a generative lrRNN framework that assumes group-wise independence among latent dynamics while allowing flexible within-group entanglement. These independent latent groups allow latent dynamics to evolve separately, but are internally rich for complex computation. We reformulate the lrRNN under a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, enabling us to introduce a partial correlation penalty that encourages disentanglement between groups of latent dimensions. Experiments on synthetic, monkey M1, and mouse voltage imaging data show that DisRNN consistently improves the disentanglement and interpretability of learned neural latent trajectories in low-dimensional space and low-rank connectivity over baseline lrRNNs that do not encourage partial disentanglement.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in predicting biomarker trajectories from real clinical data, uncertainty in the predictions poses high-stakes risks (e.g., misdiagnosis) that limit their clinical deployment. To enable safe and reliable use of such predictions in healthcare, we introduce a conformal method for uncertainty-calibrated prediction of biomarker trajectories resulting from randomly-timed clinical visits of patients. Our approach extends conformal prediction to the setting of randomly-timed trajectories via a novel nonconformity score that produces prediction bands guaranteed to cover the unknown biomarker trajectories with a user-prescribed probability. We apply our method across a wide range of standard and state-of-the-art predictors for two well-established brain biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, using neuroimaging data from real clinical studies. We observe that our conformal prediction bands consistently achieve the desired coverage, while also being tighter than baseline prediction bands. To further account for population heterogeneity, we develop group-conditional conformal bands and test their coverage guarantees across various demographic and clinically relevant subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate the clinical utility of our conformal bands in identifying subjects at high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, we introduce an uncertainty-calibrated risk score that enables the identification of 17.5% more high-risk subjects compared to standard risk scores, highlighting the value of uncertainty calibration in real-world clinical decision making. Our code is available at github.com/vatass/ConformalBiomarkerTrajectories.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for long sequence processing, outperforming traditional methods on diverse benchmarks. Fundamentally, SSMs can generalize both recurrent and convolutional networks and have been shown to even capture key functions of biological systems. Here we report an approach to implement SSMs in energy-efficient compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware to achieve real-time, event-driven processing. Our work re-parameterizes the model to function with real-valued coefficients and shared decay constants, reducing the complexity of model mapping onto practical hardware systems. By leveraging device dynamics and diagonalized state transition parameters, the state evolution can be natively implemented in crossbar-based CIM systems combined with memristors exhibiting short-term memory effects. Through this algorithm and hardware co-design, we show the proposed system offers both high accuracy and high energy efficiency while supporting fully asynchronous processing for event-based vision and audio tasks.

Abstract: Real-time imaging sonar has become an important tool for underwater monitoring in environments where optical sensing is unreliable. Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

Abstract: We develop an empirical likelihood (EL) framework for random forests and related ensemble methods, providing a likelihood-based approach to quantify their statistical uncertainty. Exploiting the incomplete $U$-statistic structure inherent in ensemble predictions, we construct an EL statistic that is asymptotically chi-squared when subsampling induced by incompleteness is not overly sparse. Under sparser subsampling regimes, the EL statistic tends to over-cover due to loss of pivotality; we therefore propose a modified EL that restores pivotality through a simple adjustment. Our method retains key properties of EL while remaining computationally efficient. Theory for honest random forests and simulations demonstrate that modified EL achieves accurate coverage and practical reliability relative to existing inference methods.

Abstract: Despite the parallel challenges that audio and text domains face in evaluating generative model outputs, preference learning remains remarkably underexplored in audio applications. Through a PRISMA-guided systematic review of approximately 500 papers, we find that only 30 (6%) apply preference learning to audio tasks. Our analysis reveals a field in transition: pre-2021 works focused on emotion recognition using traditional ranking methods (rankSVM), while post-2021 studies have pivoted toward generation tasks employing modern RLHF frameworks. We identify three critical patterns: (1) the emergence of multi-dimensional evaluation strategies combining synthetic, automated, and human preferences; (2) inconsistent alignment between traditional metrics (WER, PESQ) and human judgments across different contexts; and (3) convergence on multi-stage training pipelines that combine reward signals. Our findings suggest that while preference learning shows promise for audio, particularly in capturing subjective qualities like naturalness and musicality, the field requires standardized benchmarks, higher-quality datasets, and systematic investigation of how temporal factors unique to audio impact preference learning frameworks.

Abstract: Inter-GPU communication has become a major bottleneck for modern AI workloads as models scale and improvements in hardware compute throughput outpace improvements in interconnect bandwidth. Existing systems mitigate this through compute-communication overlap but often fail to meet theoretical peak performance across heterogeneous workloads and new accelerators. Instead of operator-specific techniques, we ask whether a small set of simple, reusable principles can systematically guide the design of optimal multi-GPU kernels. We present ParallelKittens (PK), a minimal CUDA framework that drastically simplifies the development of overlapped multi-GPU kernels. PK extends the ThunderKittens framework and embodies the principles of multi-GPU kernel design through eight core primitives and a unified programming template, derived from a comprehensive analysis of the factors that govern multi-GPU performance$\unicode{x2014}$data-transfer mechanisms, resource scheduling, and design overheads. We validate PK on both Hopper and Blackwell architectures. With fewer than 50 lines of device code, PK achieves up to $2.33 \times$ speedup for data- and tensor-parallel workloads, $4.08 \times$ for sequence-parallel workloads, and $1.22 \times$ for expert-parallel workloads.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

Abstract: Purpose: Echocardiographic interpretation requires video-level reasoning and guideline-based measurement analysis, which current deep learning models for cardiac ultrasound do not support. We present EchoAgent, a framework that enables structured, interpretable automation for this domain. Methods: EchoAgent orchestrates specialized vision tools under Large Language Model (LLM) control to perform temporal localization, spatial measurement, and clinical interpretation. A key contribution is a measurement-feasibility prediction model that determines whether anatomical structures are reliably measurable in each frame, enabling autonomous tool selection. We curated a benchmark of diverse, clinically validated video-query pairs for evaluation. Results: EchoAgent achieves accurate, interpretable results despite added complexity of spatiotemporal video analysis. Outputs are grounded in visual evidence and clinical guidelines, supporting transparency and traceability. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic, guideline-aligned reasoning for echocardiographic video analysis, enabled by task-specific tools and full video-level automation. EchoAgent sets a new direction for trustworthy AI in cardiac ultrasound.

<title>A Brain Wave Encodes a Thousand Tokens: Modeling Inter-Cortical Neural Interactions for Effective EEG-based Emotion Recognition</title>

Abstract: Human emotions are difficult to convey through words and are often abstracted in the process; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer a more direct lens into emotional brain activity. Recent studies show that deep learning models can process these signals to perform emotion recognition with high accuracy. However, many existing approaches overlook the dynamic interplay between distinct brain regions, which can be crucial to understanding how emotions unfold and evolve over time, potentially aiding in more accurate emotion recognition. To address this, we propose RBTransformer, a Transformer-based neural network architecture that models inter-cortical neural dynamics of the brain in latent space to better capture structured neural interactions for effective EEG-based emotion recognition. First, the EEG signals are converted into Band Differential Entropy (BDE) tokens, which are then passed through Electrode Identity embeddings to retain spatial provenance. These tokens are processed through successive inter-cortical multi-head attention blocks that construct an electrode x electrode attention matrix, allowing the model to learn the inter-cortical neural dependencies. The resulting features are then passed through a classification head to obtain the final prediction. We conducted extensive experiments, specifically under subject-dependent settings, on the SEED, DEAP, and DREAMER datasets, over all three dimensions, Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (for DEAP and DREAMER), under both binary and multi-class classification settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBTransformer outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets, over all three dimensions under both classification settings.

Abstract: Flaky tests that non-deterministically pass or fail waste developer time and slow release cycles. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically repairing flaky tests, existing approaches like FlakyDoctor fail in industrial settings due to the context problem: providing either too little context (missing critical production code) or too much context (overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant information). We present FlakyGuard, which addresses this problem by treating code as a graph structure and using selective graph exploration to find only the most relevant context. Evaluation on real-world flaky tests from industrial repositories shows that FlakyGuard repairs 47.6 % of reproducible flaky tests with 51.8 % of the fixes accepted by developers. Besides it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by at least 22 % in repair success rate. Developer surveys confirm that 100 % find FlakyGuard's root cause explanations useful.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

Abstract: Modern codebases evolve continuously: files are renamed or deleted; public APIs drift; behavior shifts within otherwise familiar modules. A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

Abstract: We introduce a highly expressive class of function approximators called Splat Regression Models. Model outputs are mixtures of heterogeneous and anisotropic bump functions, termed splats, each weighted by an output vector. The power of splat modeling lies in its ability to locally adjust the scale and direction of each splat, achieving both high interpretability and accuracy. Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting models and algorithms constitute a flexible and promising approach for solving diverse approximation, estimation, and inverse problems involving low-dimensional data.

Abstract: Coronal holes (CHs) are low-activity, low-density solar coronal regions with open magnetic field lines (Cranmer 2009). In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al. (2021) achieved an accuracy of 0.9708, a TSS of 0.6749, and an IoU of 0.4805, when evaluated on the CHASM-SWPC-1111 test set.

Abstract: We study a class of distributionally robust games where agents are allowed to heterogeneously choose their risk aversion with respect to distributional shifts of the uncertainty. In our formulation, heterogeneous Wasserstein ball constraints on each distribution are enforced through a penalty function leveraging a Lagrangian formulation. We then formulate the distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problem and show that under certain assumptions it is equivalent to a finite-dimensional variational inequality problem with a strongly monotone mapping. We then design an approximate Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and prove convergence of the average regret to a quantity that diminishes with the number of iterations, thus learning the desired equilibrium up to an a priori specified accuracy. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying system failures and preempting security breaches, detects irregular patterns within large volumes of log data, and impacts domains such as service reliability, performance optimization, and database log analysis. Modern log anomaly detection methods rely on training deep learning models on clean, anomaly-free log sequences. However, obtaining such clean log data requires costly and tedious human labeling, and existing automatic cleaning methods fail to fully integrate the specific characteristics and actual semantics of logs in their purification process. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware, rule-enhanced purification framework, LogPurge, that automatically selects a sufficient subset of normal log sequences from contamination log sequences to train a anomaly detection model. Our approach involves a two-stage filtering algorithm: In the first stage, we use a large language model (LLM) to remove clustered anomalous patterns and enhance system rules to improve LLM's understanding of system logs; in the second stage, we utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the remaining contaminated regions into smaller subproblems, allowing each to be effectively purified through the first stage procedure. Our experiments, conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, show that our method significantly removes an average of 98.74% of anomalies while retaining 82.39% of normal samples. Compared to the latest unsupervised log sample selection algorithms, our method achieves F-1 score improvements of 35.7% and 84.11% on the public datasets, and an impressive 149.72% F-1 improvement on the private dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Sensor data-based recognition systems are widely used in various applications, such as gait-based authentication and human activity recognition (HAR). Modern wearable and smart devices feature various built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, and such sensor-based measurements can be fed to a machine learning-based model to train and classify human activities. While deep learning-based models have proven successful in classifying human activity and gestures, they pose various security risks. In our paper, we discuss a novel dynamic trigger-generation technique for performing black-box adversarial attacks on sensor data-based IoT systems. Our empirical analysis shows that the attack is successful on various datasets and classifier models with minimal perturbation on the input data. We also provide a detailed comparative analysis of performance and stealthiness to various other poisoning techniques found in backdoor attacks. We also discuss some adversarial defense mechanisms and their impact on the effectiveness of our trigger-generation technique.

Abstract: Neonates are highly susceptible to seizures, often leading to short or long-term neurological impairments. However, clinical manifestations of neonatal seizures are subtle and often lead to misdiagnoses. This increases the risk of prolonged, untreated seizure activity and subsequent brain injury. Continuous video electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is the gold standard for seizure detection. However, this is an expensive evaluation that requires expertise and time. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network-based model for early prediction of neonatal seizures by distinguishing between interictal and preictal states of the EEG. Our model is patient-independent, enabling generalization across multiple subjects, and utilizes mel-frequency cepstral coefficient matrices extracted from multichannel EEG and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as input features. Trained and validated on the Helsinki neonatal EEG dataset with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an average accuracy of 97.52%, sensitivity of 98.31%, specificity of 96.39%, and F1-score of 97.95%, enabling accurate seizure prediction up to 30 minutes before onset. The inclusion of ECG alongside EEG improved the F1-score by 1.42%, while the incorporation of an attention mechanism yielded an additional 0.5% improvement. To enhance transparency, we incorporated SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) as an explainable artificial intelligence method to interpret the model and provided localization of seizure focus using scalp plots. The overall results demonstrate the model's potential for minimally supervised deployment in neonatal intensive care units, enabling timely and reliable prediction of neonatal seizures, while demonstrating strong generalization capability across unseen subjects through transfer learning.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) in the cloud faces growing memory bottlenecks due to the limited capacity and high cost of GPUs. While GPU memory offloading to CPU and NVMe has made large-scale training more feasible, existing approaches suffer from high tensor migration latency and suboptimal device memory utilization, ultimately increasing training time and cloud costs. To address these challenges, we present 10Cache, a resource-aware tensor caching and migration system that accelerates LLM training by intelligently coordinating memory usage across GPU, CPU, and NVMe tiers. 10Cache profiles tensor execution order to construct prefetch policies, allocates memory buffers in pinned memory based on tensor size distributions, and reuses memory buffers to minimize allocation overhead.
  Designed for cloud-scale deployments, 10Cache improves memory efficiency and reduces reliance on high-end GPUs. Across diverse LLM workloads, it achieves up to 2x speedup in training time, improves GPU cache hit rate by up to 86.6x, and increases CPU/GPU memory utilization by up to 2.15x and 1.33x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art offloading methods. These results demonstrate that 10Cache is a practical and scalable solution for optimizing LLM training throughput and resource efficiency in cloud environments.

Abstract: Fine-grained identification of IDS-flagged suspicious traffic is crucial in cybersecurity. In practice, cyber threats evolve continuously, making the discovery of novel malicious traffic a critical necessity as well as the identification of known classes. Recent studies have advanced this goal with deep models, but they often rely on task-specific architectures that limit transferability and require per-dataset tuning. In this paper we introduce MalRAG, the first LLM driven retrieval-augmented framework for open-set malicious traffic identification. MalRAG freezes the LLM and operates via comprehensive traffic knowledge construction, adaptive retrieval, and prompt engineering. Concretely, we construct a multi-view traffic database by mining prior malicious traffic from content, structural, and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, we introduce a Coverage-Enhanced Retrieval Algorithm that queries across these views to assemble the most probable candidates, thereby improving the inclusion of correct evidence. We then employ Traffic-Aware Adaptive Pruning to select a variable subset of these candidates based on traffic-aware similarity scores, suppressing incorrect matches and yielding reliable retrieved evidence. Moreover, we develop a suite of guidance prompts where task instruction, evidence referencing, and decision guidance are integrated with the retrieved evidence to improve LLM performance. Across diverse real-world datasets and settings, MalRAG delivers state-of-the-art results in both fine-grained identification of known classes and novel malicious traffic discovery. Ablation and deep-dive analyses further show that MalRAG effective leverages LLM capabilities yet achieves open-set malicious traffic identification without relying on a specific LLM.

<title>From Graphs to Hypergraphs: Enhancing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Multi-Level Relational Modeling</title>

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

<title>SCOPE: Spectral Concentration by Distributionally Robust Joint Covariance-Precision Estimation</title>

Abstract: We propose a distributionally robust formulation for simultaneously estimating the covariance matrix and the precision matrix of a random vector.The proposed model minimizes the worst-case weighted sum of the Frobenius loss of the covariance estimator and Stein's loss of the precision matrix estimator against all distributions from an ambiguity set centered at the nominal distribution. The radius of the ambiguity set is measured via convex spectral divergence. We demonstrate that the proposed distributionally robust estimation model can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, thereby yielding quasi-analytical estimators. The joint estimators are shown to be nonlinear shrinkage estimators. The eigenvalues of the estimators are shrunk nonlinearly towards a positive scalar, where the scalar is determined by the weight coefficient of the loss terms. By tuning the coefficient carefully, the shrinkage corrects the spectral bias of the empirical covariance/precision matrix estimator. By this property, we call the proposed joint estimator the Spectral concentrated COvariance and Precision matrix Estimator (SCOPE). We demonstrate that the shrinkage effect improves the condition number of the estimator. We provide a parameter-tuning scheme that adjusts the shrinkage target and intensity that is asymptotically optimal. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data show that our shrinkage estimators perform competitively against state-of-the-art estimators in practical applications.

Abstract: We develop an imaging algorithm that exploits strong scattering to achieve super-resolution in changing random media. The method processes large and diverse array datasets using sparse dictionary learning, clustering, and multidimensional scaling. Starting from random initializations, the algorithm reliably extracts the unknown medium properties necessary for accurate imaging using back-propagation, $\ell_2$ or $\ell_1$ methods. Remarkably, scattering enhances resolution beyond homogeneous medium limits. When abundant data are available, the algorithm allows the realization of super-resolution in imaging.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.

Abstract: Causal discovery combines data with knowledge provided by experts to learn the DAG representing the causal relationships between a given set of variables. When data are scarce, bagging is used to measure our confidence in an average DAG obtained by aggregating bootstrapped DAGs. However, the aggregation step has received little attention from the specialized literature: the average DAG is constructed using only the confidence in the individual edges of the bootstrapped DAGs, thus disregarding complex higher-order edge structures. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework based on higher-order structures and describe a new DAG aggregation algorithm. We perform a simulation study, discussing the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach. Our proposal is both computationally efficient and effective, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions, especially in low sample size regimes and under high dimensionality settings.

Abstract: We introduce Orion, a visual agent framework that can take in any modality and generate any modality. Using an agentic framework with multiple tool-calling capabilities, Orion is designed for visual AI tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results. Unlike traditional vision-language models that produce descriptive outputs, Orion orchestrates a suite of specialized computer vision tools, including object detection, keypoint localization, panoptic segmentation, Optical Character Recognition, and geometric analysis, to execute complex multi-step visual workflows. The system achieves competitive performance on MMMU, MMBench, DocVQA, and MMLongBench while extending monolithic vision-language models to production-grade visual intelligence. By combining neural perception with symbolic execution, Orion enables autonomous visual reasoning, marking a transition from passive visual understanding to active, tool-driven visual intelligence.

<title>Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.

Abstract: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) converts audio recordings into symbolic musical representations. Training deep neural networks (DNNs) for AMT typically requires strongly aligned training pairs with precise frame-level annotations. Since creating such datasets is costly and impractical for many musical contexts, weakly aligned approaches using segment-level annotations have gained traction. However, existing methods often rely on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) or soft alignment loss functions, both of which still require local semantic correspondences, making them error-prone and computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce CountEM, a novel AMT framework that eliminates the need for explicit local alignment by leveraging note event histograms as supervision, enabling lighter computations and greater flexibility. Using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach, CountEM iteratively refines predictions based solely on note occurrence counts, significantly reducing annotation efforts while maintaining high transcription accuracy. Experiments on piano, guitar, and multi-instrument datasets demonstrate that CountEM matches or surpasses existing weakly supervised methods, improving AMT's robustness, scalability, and efficiency.

Abstract: Heterogeneous porous materials play a crucial role in various engineering systems. Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent audio-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of audio tasks and are increasingly capable of handling long audio inputs. However, the computing costs in these models heavily depend on sequence length, which can become very large given the nature of audio data. In the vision-language domain, token pruning methods have proven effective in reducing token counts while preserving strong performance on standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate the relevance and effectiveness of such token selection strategies in the context of audio-language models. We also improve them by proposing a lightweight strategy that takes the time dimension into account. While retaining only a quarter of the initial tokens, our approach results in a relative maximum decrease of 2% in CIDEr on Clotho v2 and a relative maximum decrease of 4% in accuracy on MMAU.

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.

Abstract: In this report, we describe our submission to Track 5 of the DCASE 2025 Challenge for the task of Audio Question Answering(AQA). Our system leverages the SSL backbone BEATs to extract frame-level audio features, which are then processed by a classification head to generate segment-level predictions of acoustic events, following the Audioset ontology. These segment-level predictions are subsequently calibrated before producing event-level predictions. Finally, these predictions are incorporated into a structured prompt, along with the question and candidate answers. This prompt is then fed to a fine-tuned version of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, trained using the GRPO algorithm with a simple reward function. Our method achieves an accuracy of 62.6 % on the development set, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining acoustic event reasoning with instruction-tuned large language models for AQA.

Abstract: One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels.
  To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.

Abstract: Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control.

<title>Skewness-Robust Causal Discovery in Location-Scale Noise Models</title>

Abstract: To distinguish Markov equivalent graphs in causal discovery, it is necessary to restrict the structural causal model. Crucially, we need to be able to distinguish cause $X$ from effect $Y$ in bivariate models, that is, distinguish the two graphs $X \to Y$ and $Y \to X$. Location-scale noise models (LSNMs), in which the effect $Y$ is modeled based on the cause $X$ as $Y = f(X) + g(X)N$, form a flexible class of models that is general and identifiable in most cases. Estimating these models for arbitrary noise terms $N$, however, is challenging. Therefore, practical estimators are typically restricted to symmetric distributions, such as the normal distribution. As we showcase in this paper, when $N$ is a skewed random variable, which is likely in real-world domains, the reliability of these approaches decreases. To approach this limitation, we propose SkewD, a likelihood-based algorithm for bivariate causal discovery under LSNMs with skewed noise distributions. SkewD extends the usual normal-distribution framework to the skew-normal setting, enabling reliable inference under symmetric and skewed noise. For parameter estimation, we employ a combination of a heuristic search and an expectation conditional maximization algorithm. We evaluate SkewD on novel synthetically generated datasets with skewed noise as well as established benchmark datasets. Throughout our experiments, SkewD exhibits a strong performance and, in comparison to prior work, remains robust under high skewness.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

Abstract: Join ordering is the NP-hard problem of selecting the most efficient sequence in which to evaluate joins (conjunctive, binary operators) in a database query. As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future.

Abstract: Communication compression is essential for scalable distributed training of modern machine learning models, but it often degrades convergence due to the noise it introduces. Error Feedback (EF) mechanisms are widely adopted to mitigate this issue of distributed compression algorithms. Despite their popularity and training efficiency, existing distributed EF algorithms often require prior knowledge of problem parameters (e.g., smoothness constants) to fine-tune stepsizes. This limits their practical applicability especially in large-scale neural network training. In this paper, we study normalized error feedback algorithms that combine EF with normalized updates, various momentum variants, and parameter-agnostic, time-varying stepsizes, thus eliminating the need for problem-dependent tuning. We analyze the convergence of these algorithms for minimizing smooth functions, and establish parameter-agnostic complexity bounds that are close to the best-known bounds with carefully-tuned problem-dependent stepsizes. Specifically, we show that normalized EF21 achieve the convergence rate of near ${O}(1/T^{1/4})$ for Polyak's heavy-ball momentum, ${O}(1/T^{2/7})$ for Iterative Gradient Transport (IGT), and ${O}(1/T^{1/3})$ for STORM and Hessian-corrected momentum. Our results hold with decreasing stepsizes and small mini-batches. Finally, our empirical experiments confirm our theoretical insights.

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Structural nested mean models (SNMMs) are a principled approach to estimate the treatment effects over time. A particular strength of SNMMs is to break the joint effect of treatment sequences over time into localized, time-specific ``blip effects''. This decomposition promotes interpretability through the incremental effects and enables the efficient offline evaluation of optimal treatment policies without re-computation. However, neural frameworks for SNMMs are lacking, as their inherently sequential g-estimation scheme prevents end-to-end, gradient-based training. Here, we propose DeepBlip, the first neural framework for SNMMs, which overcomes this limitation with a novel double optimization trick to enable simultaneous learning of all blip functions. Our DeepBlip seamlessly integrates sequential neural networks like LSTMs or transformers to capture complex temporal dependencies. By design, our method correctly adjusts for time-varying confounding to produce unbiased estimates, and its Neyman-orthogonal loss function ensures robustness to nuisance model misspecification. Finally, we evaluate our DeepBlip across various clinical datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Abstract: Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.

<title>Online learning of subgrid-scale models for quasi-geostrophic turbulence in planetary interiors</title>

Abstract: The use of machine learning to represent subgrid-scale (SGS) dynamics is now well established in weather forecasting and climate modelling. Recent advances have demonstrated that SGS models trained via ``online'' end-to-end learning -- where the dynamical solver operating on the filtered equations participates in the training -- can outperform traditional physics-based approaches. Most studies, however, have focused on idealised periodic domains, neglecting the mechanical boundaries present e.g. in planetary interiors. To address this issue, we consider two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulent flow in an axisymmetric bounded domain that we model using a pseudo-spectral differentiable solver, thereby enabling online learning. We examine three configurations, varying the geometry (between an exponential container and a spherical shell) and the rotation rate. Flow is driven by a prescribed analytical forcing, allowing for precise control over the energy injection scale and an exact estimate of the power input. We evaluate the accuracy of the online-trained SGS model against the reference direct numerical simulation using integral quantities and spectral diagnostics. In all configurations, we show that an SGS model trained on data spanning only one turnover time remains stable and accurate over integrations at least a hundred times longer than the training period. Moreover, we demonstrate the model's remarkable ability to reproduce slow processes occurring on time scales far exceeding the training duration, such as the inward drift of jets in the spherical shell. These results suggest a promising path towards developing SGS models for planetary and stellar interior dynamics, including dynamo processes.

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become critical for advancing modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet existing synchronous RL systems face severe performance bottlenecks. The rollout phase, which dominates end-to-end iteration time, suffers from substantial long-tail latency and poor resource utilization due to inherent workload imbalance. We present Seer, a novel online context learning system that addresses these challenges by exploiting previously overlooked similarities in output lengths and generation patterns among requests sharing the same prompt. Seer introduces three key techniques: divided rollout for dynamic load balancing, context-aware scheduling, and adaptive grouped speculative decoding. Together, these mechanisms substantially reduce long-tail latency and improve resource efficiency during rollout. Evaluations on production-grade RL workloads demonstrate that Seer improves end-to-end rollout throughput by 74% to 97% and reduces long-tail latency by 75% to 93% compared to state-of-the-art synchronous RL systems, significantly accelerating RL training iterations.

Abstract: Radio spectrum monitoring in contested environments motivates the need for reliable automatic signal classification technology. Prior work highlights deep learning as a promising approach, but existing models depend on brute-force Doppler augmentation to achieve real-world generalization, which undermines both training efficiency and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with complex-valued layers that exploits convolutional shift equivariance in the frequency domain. To establish provable frequency bin shift invariance, we use adaptive polyphase sampling (APS) as pooling layers followed by a global average pooling layer at the end of the network. Using a synthetic dataset of common interference signals, experimental results demonstrate that unlike a vanilla CNN, our model maintains consistent classification accuracy with and without random Doppler shifts despite being trained on no Doppler-shifted examples. Overall, our method establishes an invariance-driven framework for signal classification that offers provable robustness against real-world effects.

Abstract: Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental "grammar" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

This is achieved by adopting a lifted perspective through mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD), unlike standard MFLD, however, our setting of 2SLS entails a \emph{bilevel} optimization problem in the space of probability measures. To address this challenge, we leverage the penalty gradient approach recently developed for bilevel optimization which formulates bilevel optimization as a Lagrangian problem. This leads to a novel fully first-order algorithm, termed \texttt{F$^2$BMLD}. Apart from the convergence bound, we further provide a generalization bound, revealing an inherent trade-off in the choice of the Lagrange multiplier between optimization and statistical guarantees. Finally, we empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on an offline reinforcement learning benchmark.

Abstract: As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are a class of neural networks designed to preserve symmetries inherent in the data. In this paper, we introduce a general method for modifying a neural network to enforce equivariance, a process we refer to as equivarification. We further show that group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) arise as a special case of our framework.

Abstract: Virtual Human Generative Model (VHGM) is a generative model that approximates the joint probability over more than 2000 human healthcare-related attributes. This paper presents the core algorithm, VHGM-MAE, a masked autoencoder (MAE) tailored for handling high-dimensional, sparse healthcare data. VHGM-MAE tackles four key technical challenges: (1) heterogeneity of healthcare data types, (2) probability distribution modeling, (3) systematic missingness in the training dataset arising from multiple data sources, and (4) the high-dimensional, small-$n$-large-$p$ problem. To address these challenges, VHGM-MAE employs a likelihood-based approach to model distributions with heterogeneous types, a transformer-based MAE to capture complex dependencies among observed and missing attributes, and a novel training scheme that effectively leverages available samples with diverse missingness patterns to mitigate the small-n-large-p problem. Experimental results demonstrate that VHGM-MAE outperforms existing methods in both missing value imputation and synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a major challenge to distributed learning systems, prompting the development of numerous robust learning methods. However, most existing approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the error increases with the number of model parameters. In this paper, we make a progress towards high dimensional problems, under arbitrary number of Byzantine attackers. The cornerstone of our design is a direct high dimensional semi-verified mean estimation method. The idea is to identify a subspace with large variance. The components of the mean value perpendicular to this subspace are estimated using corrupted gradient vectors uploaded from worker machines, while the components within this subspace are estimated using auxiliary dataset. As a result, a combination of large corrupted dataset and small clean dataset yields significantly better performance than using them separately. We then apply this method as the aggregator for distributed learning problems. The theoretical analysis shows that compared with existing solutions, our method gets rid of $\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimensionality, and achieves minimax optimal statistical rates. Numerical results validate our theory as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the most popular approach to deep generative modeling of images, largely due to their empirical performance and reliability. From a theoretical standpoint, a number of recent works have studied the iteration complexity of sampling, assuming access to an accurate diffusion model. In this work, we focus on understanding the sample complexity of training such a model; how many samples are needed to learn an accurate diffusion model using a sufficiently expressive neural network? Prior work showed bounds polynomial in the dimension, desired Total Variation error, and Wasserstein error. We show an exponential improvement in the dependence on Wasserstein error and depth, along with improved dependencies on other relevant parameters.

<title>Achieving Instance-dependent Sample Complexity for Constrained Markov Decision Process</title>

Abstract: We consider the reinforcement learning problem for the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which plays a central role in satisfying safety or resource constraints in sequential learning and decision-making. In this problem, we are given finite resources and a MDP with unknown transition probabilities. At each stage, we take an action, collecting a reward and consuming some resources, all assumed to be unknown and need to be learned over time. In this work, we take the first step towards deriving optimal problem-dependent guarantees for the CMDP problems. We derive a logarithmic regret bound, which translates into a $O(\frac{1}{\Delta\cdot\epsilon}\cdot\log^2(1/\epsilon))$ sample complexity bound, with $\Delta$ being a problem-dependent parameter, yet independent of $\epsilon$. Our sample complexity bound improves upon the state-of-art $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for CMDP problems established in the previous literature, in terms of the dependency on $\epsilon$. To achieve this advance, we develop a new framework for analyzing CMDP problems. To be specific, our algorithm operates in the primal space and we resolve the primal LP for the CMDP problem at each period in an online manner, with adaptive remaining resource capacities. The key elements of our algorithm are: i) a characterization of the instance hardness via LP basis, ii) an eliminating procedure that identifies one optimal basis of the primal LP, and; iii) a resolving procedure that is adaptive to the remaining resources and sticks to the characterized optimal basis.

Abstract: Although deep learning has revolutionized domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its dependence on centralized datasets raises serious privacy concerns. Federated learning addresses this issue by enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global deep learning model without compromising their data privacy. However, the performance of such a model degrades under label skew, where the label distribution differs between clients. To overcome this issue, a novel method called FedEntOpt is proposed. In each round, it selects clients to maximize the entropy of the aggregated label distribution, ensuring that the global model is exposed to data from all available classes. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 6% in classification accuracy under standard settings regardless of the model size, while achieving gains of over 30% in scenarios with low participation rates and client dropout. In addition, FedEntOpt offers the flexibility to be combined with existing algorithms, enhancing their classification accuracy by more than 40%. Importantly, its performance remains unaffected even when differential privacy is applied.

Abstract: Sensing human motions through Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) embedded in personal devices has enabled significant applications in health and wellness. Labeled IMU data is scarce, however, unlabeled or weakly labeled IMU data can be used to model human motions. For video or text modalities, the "pretrain and adapt" approach utilizes large volumes of unlabeled or weakly labeled data to build a strong feature extractor, followed by adaptation to specific tasks using limited labeled data. However, pretraining methods are poorly understood for IMU data, and pipelines are rarely evaluated on out-of-domain tasks. We propose PRIMUS: a method for PRetraining IMU encoderS that uses a novel pretraining objective that is empirically validated based on downstream performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. The PRIMUS objective effectively enhances downstream performance by combining self-supervision, multimodal, and nearest-neighbor supervision. With fewer than 500 labeled samples per class, PRIMUS improves test accuracy by up to 15%, compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To benefit the broader community, we have open-sourced our code at github.com/nokia-bell-labs/pretrained-imu-encoders.

Abstract: Modern datasets are increasingly high-dimensional and multiway, often represented as tensor-valued data with multi-indexed variables. While Transformers excel in sequence modeling and high-dimensional tasks, their direct application to multiway data is computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of dot-product attention and the need to flatten inputs, which disrupts tensor structure and cross-dimensional dependencies. We propose the Higher-Order Transformer (HOT), a novel factorized attention framework that represents multiway attention as sums of Kronecker products or sums of mode-wise attention matrices. HOT efficiently captures dense and sparse relationships across dimensions while preserving tensor structure. Theoretically, HOT retains the expressiveness of full high-order attention and allows complexity control via factorization rank. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that HOT achieves competitive performance in multivariate time series forecasting and image classification, with significantly reduced computational and memory costs. Visualizations of mode-wise attention matrices further reveal interpretable high-order dependencies learned by HOT, demonstrating its versatility for complex multiway data across diverse domains. The implementation of our proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/s-omranpour/HOT.

Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to improve the speed and reliability of radioisotope identification using gamma spectroscopy. However, meticulously labeling an experimental dataset for training is often prohibitively expensive, while training models purely on synthetic data is risky due to the domain gap between simulated and experimental measurements. In this research, we demonstrate that supervised domain adaptation can substantially improve the performance of radioisotope identification models by transferring knowledge between synthetic and experimental data domains. We consider two domain adaptation scenarios: (1) a simulation-to-simulation adaptation, where we perform multi-label proportion estimation using simulated high-purity germanium detectors, and (2) a simulation-to-experimental adaptation, where we perform multi-class, single-label classification using measured spectra from handheld lanthanum bromide (LaBr) and sodium iodide (NaI) detectors. We begin by pretraining a spectral classifier on synthetic data using a custom transformer-based neural network. After subsequent fine-tuning on just 64 labeled experimental spectra, we achieve a test accuracy of 96% in the sim-to-real scenario with a LaBr detector, far surpassing a synthetic-only baseline model (75%) and a model trained from scratch (80%) on the same 64 spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-adapted models learn more human-interpretable features than experiment-only baseline models. Overall, our results highlight the potential for supervised domain adaptation techniques to bridge the sim-to-real gap in radioisotope identification, enabling the development of accurate and explainable classifiers even in real-world scenarios where access to experimental data is limited.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become the dominant methods in image and video generation yet still suffer substantial computational costs. As an effective approach for DiT acceleration, feature caching methods are designed to cache the features of DiT in previous timesteps and reuse them in the next timesteps, allowing us to skip the computation in the next timesteps. Among them, token-wise feature caching has been introduced to perform different caching ratios for different tokens in DiTs, aiming to skip the computation for unimportant tokens while still computing the important ones. In this paper, we propose to carefully check the effectiveness in token-wise feature caching with the following two questions: (1) Is it really necessary to compute the so-called "important" tokens in each step? (2) Are so-called important tokens really important? Surprisingly, this paper gives some counter-intuition answers, demonstrating that consistently computing the selected ``important tokens'' in all steps is not necessary. The selection of the so-called ``important tokens'' is often ineffective, and even sometimes shows inferior performance than random selection. Based on these observations, this paper introduces dual feature caching referred to as DuCa, which performs aggressive caching strategy and conservative caching strategy iteratively and selects the tokens for computing randomly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in DiT, PixArt, FLUX, and OpenSora, demonstrating significant improvements than the previous token-wise feature caching.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly relied on in AI systems, predicting when they make mistakes is crucial. While a great deal of work in the field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these representations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an API. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using follow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as representations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate that training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces reliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance level (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question). Remarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate over a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In addition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate more nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be used to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that has been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers question-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code. Furthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model architectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of GPT-4o-mini).

Abstract: Wireless communications rely on path loss modeling, which is most effective when it includes the physical details of the propagation environment. Acquiring this data has historically been challenging, but geographic information systems data is becoming increasingly available with higher resolution and accuracy. Access to such details enables propagation models to more accurately predict coverage and account for interference in wireless deployments. Machine learning-based modeling can significantly support this effort, with feature based approaches allowing for accurate, efficient, and scalable propagation modeling. Building on previous work, we introduce an extended set of features that improves prediction accuracy while, most importantly, proving model generalization through rigorous statistical assessment and the use of test set holdouts.

Abstract: Importance sampling is widely used to improve the efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) training by reducing the variance of gradient estimators. However, efficiently assessing the variance reduction relative to uniform sampling remains challenging due to computational overhead. This paper proposes a method for estimating variance reduction during DNN training using only minibatches sampled under importance sampling. By leveraging the proposed method, the paper also proposes an effective minibatch size to enable automatic learning rate adjustment. An absolute metric to quantify the efficiency of importance sampling is also introduced as well as an algorithm for real-time estimation of importance scores based on moving gradient statistics. Theoretical analysis and experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed algorithm consistently reduces variance, improves training efficiency, and enhances model accuracy compared with current importance-sampling approaches while maintaining minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for backpropagation-free learning employ local error feedback to direct iterative optimisation via gradient descent. In this study, we examine the more restrictive setting where retrograde communication from neuronal outputs is unavailable for pre-synaptic weight optimisation. To address this challenge, we propose Forward Projection (FP). This randomised closed-form training method requires only a single forward pass over the entire dataset for model fitting, without retrograde communication. Our method generates target values for pre-activation membrane potentials at each layer through randomised nonlinear projections of pre-synaptic inputs and the labels, thereby encoding information from both sources. Local loss functions are optimised over pre-synaptic inputs using closed-form regression, without feedback from neuronal outputs or downstream layers. Interpretability is a key advantage of FP training; membrane potentials of hidden neurons in FP-trained networks encode information which are interpretable layer-wise as label predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP across four biomedical datasets, comparing it with backpropagation and local learning techniques such as Forward-Forward training and Local Supervision in multi-layer perceptron and convolutional architectures. In some few-shot learning tasks, FP yielded more generalisable models than those optimised via backpropagation. In large-sample tasks, FP-based models achieve generalisation comparable to gradient descent-based local learning methods while requiring only a single forward propagation step, achieving significant speed up for training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have attained human-level fluency in text generation, which complicates the distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This increases the risk of misuse and highlights the need for reliable detectors. Yet, existing detectors exhibit poor robustness on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and attacked data, which is critical for real-world scenarios. Also, they struggle to provide interpretable evidence to support their decisions, thus undermining the reliability. In light of these challenges, we propose IPAD (Inverse Prompt for AI Detection), a novel framework consisting of a Prompt Inverter that identifies predicted prompts that could have generated the input text, and two Distinguishers that examine the probability that the input texts align with the predicted prompts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IPAD outperforms the strongest baselines by 9.05% (Average Recall) on in-distribution data, 12.93% (AUROC) on out-of-distribution data, and 5.48% (AUROC) on attacked data. IPAD also performs robustly on structured datasets. Furthermore, an interpretability assessment is conducted to illustrate that IPAD enhances the AI detection trustworthiness by allowing users to directly examine the decision-making evidence, which provides interpretable support for its state-of-the-art detection results.

Abstract: Decision tree optimization is fundamental to interpretable machine learning. The most popular approach is to greedily search for the best feature at every decision point, which is fast but provably suboptimal. Recent approaches find the global optimum using branch and bound with dynamic programming, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and sparsity at great cost to scalability. An ideal solution would have the accuracy of an optimal method and the scalability of a greedy method. We introduce a family of algorithms called SPLIT (SParse Lookahead for Interpretable Trees) that moves us significantly forward in achieving this ideal balance. We demonstrate that not all sub-problems need to be solved to optimality to find high quality trees; greediness suffices near the leaves. Since each depth adds an exponential number of possible trees, this change makes our algorithms orders of magnitude faster than existing optimal methods, with negligible loss in performance. We extend this algorithm to allow scalable computation of sets of near-optimal trees (i.e., the Rashomon set).

Abstract: This paper discusses the weight parametrization of two standard 1-Lipschitz network architectures, the Almost-Orthogonal-Layers (AOL) and the SDP-based Lipschitz Layers (SLL). It examines their impact on initialization for deep 1-Lipschitz feedforward networks, and discusses underlying issues surrounding this initialization. These networks are mainly used in certifiably robust classification applications to combat adversarial attacks by limiting the impact of perturbations on the classification output. Exact and upper bounds for the parameterized weight variance were calculated assuming a standard Normal distribution initialization; additionally, an upper bound was computed assuming a Generalized Normal Distribution, generalizing the proof for Uniform, Laplace, and Normal distribution weight initializations. It is demonstrated that the weight variance holds no bearing on the output variance distribution and that only the dimension of the weight matrices matters. Additionally, this paper demonstrates that the weight initialization always causes deep 1-Lipschitz networks to decay to zero.

Abstract: Behavioral game theory models serve two purposes: yielding insights into how human decision-making works, and predicting how people would behave in novel strategic settings. A system called GameNet represents the state of the art for predicting human behavior in the setting of unrepeated simultaneous-move games, combining a simple "level-k" model of strategic reasoning with a complex neural network model of non-strategic "level-0" behavior. Although this reliance on well-established ideas from cognitive science ought to make GameNet interpretable, the flexibility of its level-0 model raises the possibility that it is able to emulate strategic reasoning. In this work, we prove that GameNet's level-0 model is indeed too general. We then introduce ElementaryNet, a novel neural network that is provably incapable of expressing strategic behavior. We show that these additional restrictions are empirically harmless, with ElementaryNet and GameNet having statistically indistinguishable performance. We then show how it is possible to derive insights about human behavior by varying ElementaryNet's features and interpreting its parameters, finding evidence of iterative reasoning, learning about the depth of this reasoning process, and showing the value of a rich level-0 specification.

Abstract: Graph learning plays a vital role in mining and analyzing complex relationships within graph data and has been widely applied to real-world scenarios such as social, citation, and e-commerce networks. Foundation models in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) have demonstrated remarkable cross-domain capabilities that are equally significant for graph data. However, existing graph learning approaches often struggle to generalize across domains. Motivated by recent advances in CV and NLP, cross-domain graph learning (CDGL) has gained renewed attention as a promising step toward realizing true graph foundation models. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and analysis of existing works on CDGL. We propose a new taxonomy that categorizes existing approaches according to the type of transferable knowledge learned across domains: structure-oriented, feature-oriented, and mixture-oriented. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically summarize representative methods in each category, discuss the key challenges and limitations of current studies, and outline promising directions for future research. A continuously updated collection of related works is available at: https://github.com/cshhzhao/Awesome-Cross-Domain-Graph-Learning.

<title>Proofs as Explanations: Short Certificates for Reliable Predictions</title>

Abstract: We consider a model for explainable AI in which an explanation for a prediction $h(x)=y$ consists of a subset $S'$ of the training data (if it exists) such that all classifiers $h' \in H$ that make at most $b$ mistakes on $S'$ predict $h'(x)=y$. Such a set $S'$ serves as a proof that $x$ indeed has label $y$ under the assumption that (1) the target function $h^\star$ belongs to $H$, and (2) the set $S$ contains at most $b$ corrupted points. For example, if $b=0$ and $H$ is the family of linear classifiers in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and if $x$ lies inside the convex hull of the positive data points in $S$ (and hence every consistent linear classifier labels $x$ as positive), then Carath\'eodory's theorem states that $x$ lies inside the convex hull of $d+1$ of those points. So, a set $S'$ of size $d+1$ could be released as an explanation for a positive prediction, and would serve as a short proof of correctness of the prediction under the assumption of realizability.
  In this work, we consider this problem more generally, for general hypothesis classes $H$ and general values $b\geq 0$. We define the notion of the robust hollow star number of $H$ (which generalizes the standard hollow star number), and show that it precisely characterizes the worst-case size of the smallest certificate achievable, and analyze its size for natural classes. We also consider worst-case distributional bounds on certificate size, as well as distribution-dependent bounds that we show tightly control the sample size needed to get a certificate for any given test example. In particular, we define a notion of the certificate coefficient $\varepsilon_x$ of an example $x$ with respect to a data distribution $D$ and target function $h^\star$, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on sample size as a function of $\varepsilon_x$, $b$, and the VC dimension $d$ of $H$.

<title>Non-Uniform Class-Wise Coreset Selection for Vision Model Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Coreset selection aims to identify a small yet highly informative subset of data, thereby enabling more efficient model training while reducing storage overhead. Recently, this capability has been leveraged to tackle the challenges of fine-tuning large foundation models, offering a direct pathway to their efficient and practical deployment. However, most existing methods are class-agnostic, causing them to overlook significant difficulty variations among classes. This leads them to disproportionately prune samples from either overly easy or hard classes, resulting in a suboptimal allocation of the data budget that ultimately degrades the final coreset performance. To address this limitation, we propose Non-Uniform Class-Wise Coreset Selection (NUCS), a novel framework that both integrates class-level and sample-level difficulty. We propose a robust metric for global class difficulty, quantified as the winsorized average of per-sample difficulty scores. Guided by this metric, our method performs a theoretically-grounded, non-uniform allocation of data selection budgets inter-class, while adaptively selecting samples intra-class with optimal difficulty ranges. Extensive experiments on a wide range of visual classification tasks demonstrate that NUCS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 10 diverse datasets and pre-trained models, achieving both superior accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting the promise of non-uniform class-wise selection strategy for advancing the efficient fine-tuning of large foundation models.

Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that training trajectories of multiple deep neural networks with different architectures, optimization algorithms, hyper-parameter settings, and regularization methods evolve on a remarkably low-dimensional "hyper-ribbon-like" manifold in the space of probability distributions. Inspired by the similarities in the training trajectories of deep networks and linear networks, we analytically characterize this phenomenon for the latter. We show, using tools in dynamical systems theory, that the geometry of this low-dimensional manifold is controlled by (i) the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the input correlation matrix of the training data, (ii) the relative scale of the ground-truth output to the weights at the beginning of training, and (iii) the number of steps of gradient descent. By analytically computing and bounding the contributions of these quantities, we characterize phase boundaries of the region where hyper-ribbons are to be expected. We also extend our analysis to kernel machines and linear models that are trained with stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, deceptive behaviors can undermine evaluation and mislead users at deployment. Recent work has shown that lie detectors can accurately classify deceptive behavior, but they are not typically used in the training pipeline due to concerns around contamination and objective hacking. We examine these concerns by incorporating a lie detector into the labelling step of LLM post-training and evaluating whether the learned policy is genuinely more honest, or instead learns to fool the lie detector while remaining deceptive. Using DolusChat, a novel 65k-example dataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses, we identify three key factors that determine the honesty of learned policies: amount of exploration during preference learning, lie detector accuracy, and KL regularization strength. We find that preference learning with lie detectors and GRPO can lead to policies which evade lie detectors, with deception rates of over 85\%. However, if the lie detector true positive rate (TPR) or KL regularization is sufficiently high, GRPO learns honest policies. In contrast, off-policy algorithms (DPO) consistently lead to deception rates under 25\% for realistic TPRs. Our results illustrate a more complex picture than previously assumed: depending on the context, lie-detector-enhanced training can be a powerful tool for scalable oversight, or a counterproductive method encouraging undetectable misalignment.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) models directly in low-precision offers a way to address computational costs by improving both throughput and energy efficiency. For those purposes, NVIDIA's recent Blackwell architecture facilitates very low-precision operations using FP4 variants. Yet, current algorithms for training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we investigate hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce a new approach for accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (i.e., linear layers) in low precision. Through extensive evaluations on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies performance trade-offs across bit-widths and training setups. Guided by this investigation, we design an "optimal" technique in terms of accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized CUDA kernels tailored for Blackwell, demonstrating that fully FP4-based training is a competitive alternative to FP16 half-precision and to FP8 training. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet.

Abstract: We introduce the attention-indexed model (AIM), a theoretical framework for analyzing learning in deep attention layers. Inspired by multi-index models, AIM captures how token-level outputs emerge from layered bilinear interactions over high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike prior tractable attention models, AIM allows full-width key and query matrices, aligning more closely with practical transformers. Using tools from statistical mechanics and random matrix theory, we derive closed-form predictions for Bayes-optimal generalization error and identify sharp phase transitions as a function of sample complexity, model width, and sequence length. We propose a matching approximate message passing algorithm and show that gradient descent can reach optimal performance. AIM offers a solvable playground for understanding learning in self-attention layers, that are key components of modern architectures.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective. FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Designing neural networks typically relies on manual trial and error or a neural architecture search (NAS) followed by weight training. The former is time-consuming and labor-intensive, while the latter often discretizes architecture search and weight optimization. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally different approach that simultaneously optimizes both the architecture and the weights of a neural network. Our framework first trains a universal multi-scale autoencoder that embeds both architectural and parametric information into a continuous latent space, where functionally similar neural networks are mapped closer together. Given a dataset, we then randomly initialize a point in the embedding space and update it via gradient descent to obtain the optimal neural network, jointly optimizing its structure and weights. The optimization process incorporates sparsity and compactness penalties to promote efficient models. Experiments on synthetic regression tasks demonstrate that our method effectively discovers sparse and compact neural networks with strong performance.

Abstract: Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) generate high-quality data from a noise distribution. However, their sampling process demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with high computational complexity. State-of-the-art methods focus on reducing the number of discrete time steps during sampling to improve efficiency. In this work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity tradeoff can also be controlled in terms of the neural network length. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its depth. Then, we apply a length consistency term during flow matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our ODE$_t$(ODE$_l$) approach is solver-agnostic in time dimension and reduces both latency and, importantly, memory usage. CelebA-HQ and ImageNet generation experiments show a latency reduction of up to $2\times$ in the most efficient sampling mode, and FID improvement of up to $2.8$ points for high-quality sampling when applied to prior methods. We open-source our code and checkpoints at github.com/gudovskiy/odelt.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target performance level, providing the first principled guidance for compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop \textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on representative reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC) demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance. Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large knowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to distill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream applications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations: they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive learning, and their application to the largest graphs requires significant engineering effort due to GPU memory limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to ensure global embedding consistency by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph with message passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable, few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive (black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed). Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis - consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its performance under uncertainty.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification, and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference. However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax, an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax, proving its convergence via exponential amplification of the gap ratio between the maximum and runner-up elements. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is critical in domains such as cybersecurity and finance, especially when working with large-scale tabular data. Yet, unsupervised anomaly detection-where no labeled anomalies are available-remains challenging because traditional deep learning methods model a single global distribution, assuming all samples follow the same behavior. In contrast, real-world data often contain heterogeneous contexts (e.g., different users, accounts, or devices), where globally rare events may be normal within specific conditions. We introduce a contextual learning framework that explicitly models how normal behavior varies across contexts by learning conditional data distributions $P(\mathbf{Y} \mid \mathbf{C})$ rather than a global joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X})$. The framework encompasses (1) a probabilistic formulation for context-conditioned learning, (2) a principled bilevel optimization strategy for automatically selecting informative context features using early validation loss, and (3) theoretical grounding through variance decomposition and discriminative learning principles. We instantiate this framework using a novel conditional Wasserstein autoencoder as a simple yet effective model for tabular anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that contextual learning consistently outperforms global approaches-even when the optimal context is not intuitively obvious-establishing a new foundation for anomaly detection in heterogeneous tabular data.

<title>Retrosynthesis Planning via Worst-path Policy Optimisation in Tree-structured MDPs</title>

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning aims to decompose target molecules into available building blocks, forming a synthetic tree where each internal node represents an intermediate compound and each leaf ideally corresponds to a purchasable reactant. However, this tree becomes invalid if any leaf node is not a valid building block, making the planning process vulnerable to the "weakest link" in the synthetic route. Existing methods often optimise for average performance across branches, failing to account for this worst-case sensitivity. In this paper, we reframe retrosynthesis as a worst-path optimisation problem within tree-structured Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that this formulation admits a unique optimal solution and provides monotonic improvement guarantees. Building on this insight, we introduce Interactive Retrosynthesis Planning (InterRetro), a method that interacts with the tree MDP, learns a value function for worst-path outcomes, and improves its policy through self-imitation, preferentially reinforcing past decisions with high estimated advantage. Empirically, InterRetro achieves state-of-the-art results - solving 100% of targets on the Retro*-190 benchmark, shortening synthetic routes by 4.9%, and achieving promising performance using only 10% of the training data.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently received increasing attention for its promising ability in dimensionality reduction on multi-view unlabeled data. Existing MUFS methods typically select discriminative features by capturing correlations between features and clustering labels. However, an important yet underexplored question remains: \textit{Are such correlations sufficiently reliable to guide feature selection?} In this paper, we analyze MUFS from a causal perspective by introducing a novel structural causal model, which reveals that existing methods may select irrelevant features because they overlook spurious correlations caused by confounders. Building on this causal perspective, we propose a novel MUFS method called CAusal multi-view Unsupervised feature Selection leArning (CAUSA). Specifically, we first employ a generalized unsupervised spectral regression model that identifies informative features by capturing dependencies between features and consensus clustering labels. We then introduce a causal regularization module that can adaptively separate confounders from multi-view data and simultaneously learn view-shared sample weights to balance confounder distributions, thereby mitigating spurious correlations. Thereafter, integrating both into a unified learning framework enables CAUSA to select causally informative features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CAUSA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of causal multi-view feature selection in the unsupervised setting.

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have been supported by the emergence of domain-specific software libraries, enabling streamlined workflows and increased reproducibility. For geospatial machine learning (GeoML), the availability of Earth observation data has outpaced the development of domain libraries to handle its unique challenges, such as varying spatial resolutions, spectral properties, temporal cadence, data coverage, coordinate systems, and file formats. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of GeoML libraries, analyzing their evolution, core functionalities, and the current ecosystem. It also introduces popular GeoML libraries such as TorchGeo, eo-learn, and Raster Vision, detailing their architecture, supported data types, and integration with ML frameworks. Additionally, it discusses common methodologies for data preprocessing, spatial--temporal joins, benchmarking, and the use of pretrained models. Through a case study in crop type mapping, it demonstrates practical applications of these tools. Best practices in software design, licensing, and testing are highlighted, along with open challenges and future directions, particularly the rise of foundation models and the need for governance in open-source geospatial software. Our aim is to guide practitioners, developers, and researchers in navigating and contributing to the rapidly evolving GeoML landscape.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures. FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements, with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing diffusion-based models.

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models. Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage, and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables (WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10 compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks, motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs and its real-time science applications.

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general, revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated using simplified transformers.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior $p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an $L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves. Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future physical state of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. However, existing world models often focus on random generation of open worlds, but neglect the need for high-fidelity modeling of deterministic scenarios (such as fixed-map mazes and static space robot navigation). In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone a deterministic 3D world. 1) Through diagnostic experiment, we quantitatively demonstrate that high-fidelity cloning is feasible and the primary bottleneck for long-horizon fidelity is the geometric structure of the latent representation, not the dynamics model itself. 2) Building on this insight, we show that applying temporal contrastive learning principle as a geometric regularization can effectively curate a latent space that better reflects the underlying physical state manifold, demonstrating that contrastive constraints can serve as a powerful inductive bias for stable world modeling; we call this approach Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM). At its core is a lightweight geometric regularization module that can be seamlessly integrated into standard autoencoders, reshaping their latent space to provide a stable foundation for effective dynamics modeling. By focusing on representation quality, GRWM offers a simple yet powerful pipeline for improving world model fidelity.

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Abstract: In this study, we present and validate the predictive capability of the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) methodology for solving a variety of engineering and biological dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While traditional numerical methods a re effective for many ODEs, they often struggle to achieve convergence in problems involving high stiffness, shocks, irregular domains, singular perturbations, high dimensions, or boundary discontinuities. Alternatively, PINNs offer a powerful approach for handling challenging numerical scenarios. In this study, classical ODE problems are employed as controlled testbeds to systematically evaluate the accuracy, training efficiency, and generalization capability under controlled conditions of the PINNs framework. Although not a universal solution, PINNs can achieve superior results by embedding physical laws directly into the learning process. We first analyze the existence and uniqueness properties of several benchmark problems and subsequently validate the PINNs methodology on these model systems. Our results demonstrate that for complex problems to converge to correct solutions, the loss function components data loss, initial condition loss, and residual loss must be appropriately balanced through careful weighting. We further establish that systematic tuning of hyperparameters, including network depth, layer width, activation functions, learning rate, optimization algorithms, w eight initialization schemes, and collocation point sampling, plays a crucial role in achieving accurate solutions. Additionally, embedding prior knowledge and imposing hard constraints on the network architecture, without loss the generality of the ODE system, significantly enhances the predictive capability of PINNs.

Abstract: Physical Neural Networks (PNN) are promising platforms for next-generation computing systems. However, recent advances in digital neural network performance are largely driven by the rapid growth in the number of trainable parameters and, so far, demonstrated PNNs are lagging behind by several orders of magnitude in terms of scale. This mirrors size and performance constraints found in early digital neural networks. In that period, efficient reuse of parameters contributed to the development of parameter-efficient architectures such as convolutional neural networks.
  In this work, we numerically investigate hardware-friendly weight-tying for PNNs. Crucially, with many PNN systems, there is a time-scale separation between the fast dynamic active elements of the forward pass and the only slowly trainable elements implementing weights and biases. With this in mind,we propose the Reuse of Layers for eXpanding a Neural Network (ReLaX-Net) architecture, which employs a simple layer-by-layer time-multiplexing scheme to increase the effective network depth and efficiently use the number of parameters. We only require the addition of fast switches for existing PNNs. We validate ReLaX-Nets via numerical experiments on image classification and natural language processing tasks. Our results show that ReLaX-Net improves computational performance with only minor modifications to a conventional PNN. We observe a favorable scaling, where ReLaX-Nets exceed the performance of equivalent traditional RNNs or DNNs with the same number of parameters.

Abstract: Green hydrogen production via polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis is pivotal for energy transition, yet hydrogen crossover through membranes threatens safety and economic viability-approaching explosive limits (4 mol% H$_2$ in O$_2$) while reducing Faradaic efficiency by 2.5%. Current physics-based models require extensive calibration and computational resources that preclude real-time implementation, while purely data-driven approaches fail to extrapolate beyond training conditions-critical for dynamic electrolyzer operation. Here we present the first application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for hydrogen crossover prediction, integrating mass conservation, Fick's diffusion law, and Henry's solubility law within a compact architecture (17,793 parameters). Validated across six membranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar, 25-85{\deg}C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^{2}$ = 99.84% $\pm$ 0.15\%, RMSE = 0.0932% $\pm$ 0.0438%) based on five-fold cross-validation, with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control. Remarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at pressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural networks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs to edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring essential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and computational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time electrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green hydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging plays a vital role in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. Most existing methods rely heavily on long and continuous EEG recordings, which poses significant challenges for data acquisition in resource-constrained systems, such as wearable or home-based monitoring systems. In this paper, we propose the task of resource-efficient sleep staging, which aims to reduce the amount of signal collected per sleep epoch while maintaining reliable classification performance. To solve this task, we adopt the masking and prompt learning strategy and propose a novel framework called Mask-Aware Sleep Staging (MASS). Specifically, we design a multi-level masking strategy to promote effective feature modeling under partial and irregular observations. To mitigate the loss of contextual information introduced by masking, we further propose a hierarchical prompt learning mechanism that aggregates unmasked data into a global prompt, serving as a semantic anchor for guiding both patch-level and epoch-level feature modeling. MASS is evaluated on four datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, especially when the amount of data is very limited. This result highlights its potential for efficient and scalable deployment in real-world low-resource sleep monitoring environments.

Abstract: We introduce MI-to-Mid Distilled Compression (M2M-DC), a two-scale, shape-safe compression framework that interleaves information-guided block pruning with progressive inner slicing and staged knowledge distillation (KD). First, M2M-DC ranks residual (or inverted-residual) blocks by a label-aware mutual information (MI) signal and removes the least informative units (structured prune-after-training). It then alternates short KD phases with stage-coherent, residual-safe channel slicing: (i) stage "planes" (co-slicing conv2 out-channels with the downsample path and next-stage inputs), and (ii) an optional mid-channel trim (conv1 out / bn1 / conv2 in). This targets complementary redundancy, whole computational motifs and within-stage width while preserving residual shape invariants. On CIFAR-100, M2M-DC yields a clean accuracy-compute frontier. For ResNet-18, we obtain 85.46% Top-1 with 3.09M parameters and 0.0139 GMacs (72% params, 63% GMacs vs. teacher; mean final 85.29% over three seeds). For ResNet-34, we reach 85.02% Top-1 with 5.46M params and 0.0195 GMacs (74% / 74% vs. teacher; mean final 84.62%). Extending to inverted-residuals, MobileNetV2 achieves a mean final 68.54% Top-1 at 1.71M params (27%) and 0.0186 conv GMacs (24%), improving over the teacher's 66.03% by +2.5 points across three seeds. Because M2M-DC exposes only a thin, architecture-aware interface (blocks, stages, and down sample/skip wiring), it generalizes across residual CNNs and extends to inverted-residual families with minor legalization rules. The result is a compact, practical recipe for deployment-ready models that match or surpass teacher accuracy at a fraction of the compute.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to improve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, applying RL to open-domain tasks faces two key challenges: (1) the inherent subjectivity of these tasks prevents the verifiable rewards as required by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR); (2) Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) relies on external reward mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Self-Examining Reinforcement Learning (SERL), a novel self-improving framework where the LLM serves as both Actor and Judge. SERL introduces two synergistic reward mechanisms without any external signals. On the one hand, to improve the Actor's capability, we derive rewards from Copeland-style pairwise comparison judgments across a group of generated responses. On the other hand, a self-consistency reward that encourages coherent judgments is proposed to improve the Judge's reliability. This process refines the Judge's capability, which in turn provides a more robust reward for Actor. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing self-improvement training methods. SERL improves the LC win rate of Qwen3-8B on AlpacaEval 2 from 52.37% to 59.90%. To the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-improving approaches. Furthermore, it achieves a performance comparable to significantly larger models like Qwen3-32B, demonstrating superior effectiveness and robustness on open-domain tasks.

Abstract: Identifying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional probability measures is an essential pre-processing step for efficient sampling. We introduce a method for identifying and approximating a target measure $\pi$ as a perturbation of a given reference measure $\mu$ along a few significant directions of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The reference measure can be a Gaussian or a nonlinear transformation of a Gaussian, as commonly arising in generative modeling. Our method extends prior work on minimizing majorizations of the Kullback--Leibler divergence to identify optimal approximations within this class of measures. Our main contribution unveils a connection between the \emph{dimensional} logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) and approximations with this ansatz. Specifically, when the target and reference are both Gaussian, we show that minimizing the dimensional LSI is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence restricted to this ansatz. For general non-Gaussian measures, the dimensional LSI produces majorants that uniformly improve on previous majorants for gradient-based dimension reduction. We further demonstrate the applicability of this analysis to the squared Hellinger distance, where analogous reasoning shows that the dimensional Poincar\'e inequality offers improved bounds.

Abstract: The prediction modeling of drug-target interactions is crucial to drug discovery and design, which has seen rapid advancements owing to deep learning technologies. Recently developed methods, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, demonstrate exceptional performance across various datasets by effectively extracting structural information. However, the benchmarking of these novel methods often varies significantly in terms of hyperparameter settings and datasets, which limits algorithmic progress. In view of these, we conducted a comprehensive survey and benchmark for drug-target interaction modeling from a structural perspective via integrating tens of explicit (i.e., GNN-based) and implicit (i.e., Transformer-based) structure learning algorithms. We conducted a macroscopical comparison between these two classes of encoding strategies as well as the different featurization techniques that inform molecules' chemical and physical properties. We then carry out the microscopical comparison between all the integrated models across the six datasets via comprehensively benchmarking their effectiveness and efficiency. To ensure fairness, we investigate model performance under individually optimized configuration. Remarkably, the summarized insights from the benchmark studies lead to the design of model combos. We demonstrate that our combos can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on various datasets associated with cost-effective memory and computation.

<title>The Energy Cost of Artificial Intelligence Lifecycle in Communication Networks</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being incorporated in several optimization, scheduling, orchestration as well as in native communication network functions. This paradigm shift results in increased energy consumption, however, quantifying the end-to-end energy consumption of adding intelligence to communication systems remains an open challenge since conventional energy consumption metrics focus on either communication, computation infrastructure, or model development. To address this, we propose a new metric, the Energy Cost of AI Lifecycle (eCAL) of an AI model in a system. eCAL captures the energy consumption throughout the development, deployment and utilization of an AI-model providing intelligence in a communication network by (i) analyzing the complexity of data collection and manipulation in individual components and (ii) deriving overall and per-bit energy consumption. We show that as a trained AI model is used more frequently for inference, its energy cost per inference decreases, since the fixed training energy is amortized over a growing number of inferences. For a simple case study we show that eCAL for 100 inferences is 2.73 times higher than for 1000 inferences. Additionally, we have developed a modular and extendable open-source simulation tool to enable researchers, practitioners, and engineers to calculate the end-to-end energy cost with various configurations and across various systems, ensuring adaptability to diverse use cases.

Abstract: Streamlining constraints (or streamliners, for short) narrow the search space, enhancing the speed and feasibility of solving complex constraint satisfaction problems. Traditionally, streamliners were crafted manually or generated through systematically combined atomic constraints with high-effort offline testing. Our approach utilizes the creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose effective streamliners for problems specified in the MiniZinc constraint programming language and integrates feedback to the LLM with quick empirical tests for validation. Evaluated across seven diverse constraint satisfaction problems, our method achieves substantial runtime reductions. We compare the results to obfuscated and disguised variants of the problem to see whether the results depend on LLM memorization. We also analyze whether longer off-line runs improve the quality of streamliners and whether the LLM can propose good combinations of streamliners.

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly engage with human society, how well do we understand their prosocial behaviors? We (1) investigate how LLM agents' prosocial behaviors can be induced by different personas and benchmarked against human behaviors; and (2) introduce a social science approach to evaluate LLM agents' decision-making. We explored how different personas and experimental framings affect these AI agents' altruistic behavior in dictator games and compared their behaviors within the same LLM family, across various families, and with human behaviors. The findings reveal that merely assigning a human-like identity to LLMs does not produce human-like behaviors. These findings suggest that LLM agents' reasoning does not consistently exhibit textual markers of human decision-making in dictator games and that their alignment with human behavior varies substantially across model architectures and prompt formulations; even worse, such dependence does not follow a clear pattern. As society increasingly integrates machine intelligence, "Prosocial AI" emerges as a promising and urgent research direction in philanthropic studies.

Abstract: A hallmark of advanced artificial intelligence is the capacity to progress from passive visual perception to the strategic modification of visual information to facilitate complex reasoning. This advanced capability, however, remains critically underdeveloped in current Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). The deficiency is often masked by evaluation metrics that prioritize final-answer accuracy, creating an illusion of competence where genuine reasoning is absent. Using the domain of geometric problem-solving as a precise instrument, we probe this issue through tasks that require constructing visual aids. To this end, we introduce \textbf{VisAidMath}, a challenging benchmark, and our novel Three-Layered Funnel Evaluation Framework. This framework moves beyond simple accuracy (ACCU) to scrutinize the generation of valid visual aids (PVA) and the soundness of subsequent reasoning steps (SPRS). Our extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models, including Doubao-Seed-1.6 and o4, reveal a profound ``Reasoning Illusion''. We observe that high surface-level accuracy conceals a catastrophic failure in the models' ability to produce valid visual aids or to reason from them. Our findings expose a fundamental schism between visual perception and logical deduction in modern LMMs. We host an evaluation platform at CodaBench for testing publicly.

<title>Iris: Integrating Language into Diffusion-based Monocular Depth Estimation</title>

Abstract: Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisances. We demonstrate that language can enhance monocular depth estimation by providing an additional condition (rather than images alone) aligned with plausible 3D scenes, thereby reducing the solution space for depth estimation. This conditional distribution is learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. To generate images under various viewpoints and layouts that precisely reflect textual descriptions, the model implicitly models object sizes, shapes, and scales, their spatial relationships, and the overall scene structure. In this paper, Iris, we investigate the benefits of our strategy to integrate text descriptions into training and inference of diffusion-based depth estimation models. We experiment with three different diffusion-based monocular depth estimators (Marigold, Lotus, and E2E-FT) and their variants. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, and evaluating on NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, ScanNet, and DIODE, we find that our strategy improves the overall monocular depth estimation accuracy, especially in small areas. It also improves the model's depth perception of specific regions described in the text. We find that by providing more details in the text, the depth prediction can be iteratively refined. Simultaneously, we find that language can act as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. Code and generated text data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Pulmonary Embolism (PE) are a leading cause of cardiovascular death. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the gold standard for PE diagnosis, with growing interest in AI-based diagnostic assistance. However, these algorithms are limited by scarce fine-grained annotations of thromboembolic burden. We address this challenge with iExplain, a weakly supervised learning algorithm that transforms coarse image-level annotations into detailed pixel-level PE masks through iterative model explainability. Our approach generates soft segmentation maps used to mask detected regions, enabling the process to repeat and discover additional embolisms that would be missed in a single pass. This iterative refinement effectively captures complete PE regions and detects multiple distinct embolisms. Models trained on these automatically generated annotations achieve excellent PE detection performance, with significant improvements at each iteration. We demonstrate iExplain's effectiveness on the RSPECT augmented dataset, achieving results comparable to strongly supervised methods while outperforming existing weakly supervised methods.

Abstract: Soft robots can revolutionize several applications with high demands on dexterity and safety. When operating these systems, real-time estimation and control require fast and accurate models. However, prediction with first-principles (FP) models is slow, and learned black-box models have poor generalizability. Physics-informed machine learning offers excellent advantages here, but it is currently limited to simple, often simulated systems without considering changes after training. We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for articulated soft robots (ASRs) with a focus on data efficiency. The amount of expensive real-world training data is reduced to a minimum -- one dataset in one system domain. Two hours of data in different domains are used for a comparison against two gold-standard approaches: In contrast to a recurrent neural network, the PINN provides a high generalizability. The prediction speed of an accurate FP model is exceeded with the PINN by up to a factor of 467 at slightly reduced accuracy. This enables nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) of a pneumatic ASR. Accurate position tracking with the MPC running at 47 Hz is achieved in six dynamic experiments.

Abstract: Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. MoM serves as a general framework that can be seamlessly combined with diverse memory update mechanisms across linear models. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

Abstract: Personalization is central to human-AI interaction, yet current diffusion-based image generation systems remain largely insensitive to user diversity. Existing attempts to address this often rely on costly paired preference data or introduce latency through Large Language Models. In this work, we introduce REBECA (REcommendations BEyond CAtalogs), a lightweight and scalable framework for personalized image generation that learns directly from implicit feedback signals such as likes, ratings, and clicks. Instead of fine-tuning the underlying diffusion model, REBECA employs a two-stage process: training a conditional diffusion model to sample user- and rating-specific image embeddings, which are subsequently decoded into images using a pretrained diffusion backbone. This approach enables efficient, fine-tuning-free personalization across large user bases. We rigorously evaluate REBECA on real-world datasets, proposing a novel statistical personalization verifier and a permutation-based hypothesis test to assess preference alignment. Our results demonstrate that REBECA consistently produces high-fidelity images tailored to individual tastes, outperforming baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Traditional feature extraction and projection techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis, struggle to adequately represent X-Ray Transmission (XRT) Multi-Energy (ME) images, limiting the performance of neural networks in decision-making processes. To address this issue, we propose a method that approximates the dataset topology by constructing adjacency graphs using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. This approach captures nonlinear correlations within the data, significantly improving the performance of machine learning algorithms, particularly in processing Hyperspectral Images (HSI) from X-ray transmission spectroscopy. This technique not only preserves the global structure of the data but also enhances feature separability, leading to more accurate and robust classification results.

Abstract: We propose a framework to convert $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-approximate Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms into $(\varepsilon', 0)$-pure DP mechanisms under certain conditions, a process we call ``purification.'' This algorithmic technique leverages randomized post-processing with calibrated noise to eliminate the $\delta$ parameter while achieving near-optimal privacy-utility tradeoff for pure DP. It enables a new design strategy for pure DP algorithms: first run an approximate DP algorithm with certain conditions, and then purify. This approach allows one to leverage techniques such as strong composition and propose-test-release that require $\delta>0$ in designing pure-DP methods with $\delta=0$. We apply this framework in various settings, including Differentially Private Empirical Risk Minimization (DP-ERM), stability-based release, and query release tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work with a statistically and computationally efficient reduction from approximate DP to pure DP. Finally, we illustrate the use of this reduction for proving lower bounds under approximate DP constraints with explicit dependence in $\delta$, avoiding the sophisticated fingerprinting code construction.

Abstract: Circuit link prediction, which identifies missing component connections from incomplete netlists, is crucial in analog circuit design automation. However, existing methods face three main challenges: 1) Insufficient use of topological patterns in circuit graphs reduces prediction accuracy; 2) Data scarcity due to the complexity of annotations hinders model generalization; 3) Limited adaptability to various netlist formats restricts model flexibility. We propose Graph Neural Networks Based Analog Circuit Link Prediction (GNN-ACLP), a graph neural networks (GNNs) based method featuring three innovations to tackle these challenges. First, we introduce the SEAL (learning from Subgraphs, Embeddings, and Attributes for Link prediction) framework and achieve port-level accuracy in circuit link prediction. Second, we propose Netlist Babel Fish, a netlist format conversion tool that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a large language model (LLM) to enhance the compatibility of netlist formats. Finally, we build a comprehensive dataset, SpiceNetlist, comprising 775 annotated circuits of 7 different types across 10 component classes. Experiments demonstrate accuracy improvements of 16.08% on SpiceNetlist, 11.38% on Image2Net, and 16.01% on Masala-CHAI compared to the baseline in intra-dataset evaluation, while maintaining accuracy from 92.05% to 99.07% in cross-dataset evaluation, demonstrating robust feature transfer capabilities. However, its linear computational complexity makes processing large-scale netlists challenging and requires future addressing.

Abstract: Mobile jammers pose a critical threat to 5G networks, particularly in military communications. We propose an intelligent anti-jamming framework that integrates Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) for high-resolution Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation, Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamforming for adaptive interference suppression, and machine learning (ML) to enhance DoA prediction for mobile jammers. Extensive simulations in a realistic highway scenario demonstrate that our hybrid approach achieves an average Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of 9.58 dB (maximum 11.08 dB) and up to 99.8% DoA estimation accuracy. The framework's computational efficiency and adaptability to dynamic jammer mobility patterns outperform conventional anti-jamming techniques, making it a robust solution for securing 5G communications in contested environments.

<title>TooBadRL: Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making applications, including robotics, healthcare, smart grids, and finance. Recent studies reveal that adversaries can implant backdoors into DRL agents during the training phase. These backdoors can later be activated by specific triggers during deployment, compelling the agent to execute targeted actions and potentially leading to severe consequences, such as drone crashes or vehicle collisions. However, existing backdoor attacks utilize simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking the critical impact of trigger design on attack effectiveness. To address this gap, we introduce TooBadRL, the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor triggers across three critical aspects: injection timing, trigger dimension, and manipulation magnitude. Specifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing mechanism to determine the injection timing during training. Then, we formulate trigger selection as an influence attribution problem and apply Shapley value analysis to identify the most influential trigger dimension for injection. Furthermore, we propose an adversarial input synthesis method to optimize the manipulation magnitude under environmental constraints. Extensive evaluations on three DRL algorithms and nine benchmark tasks demonstrate that TooBadRL outperforms five baseline methods in terms of attack success rate while only slightly affecting normal task performance. We further evaluate potential defense strategies from detection and mitigation perspectives. We open-source our code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

This inherently ill-posed problem is often addressed by classical geophysical inversion methods, which typically yield a single maximum-likelihood model that fails to capture the full range of plausible geology. The adoption of modern deep learning methods has been limited by the lack of large 3D training datasets. We address this gap with \textit{StructuralGeo}, a geological simulation engine that mimics eons of tectonic, magmatic, and sedimentary processes to generate a virtually limitless supply of realistic synthetic 3D lithological models. Using this dataset, we train both unconditional and conditional generative flow-matching models with a 3D attention U-net architecture. The resulting foundation model can reconstruct multiple plausible 3D scenarios from surface topography and sparse borehole data, depicting structures such as layers, faults, folds, and dikes. By sampling many reconstructions from the same observations, we introduce a probabilistic framework for estimating the size and extent of subsurface features. While the realism of the output is bounded by the fidelity of the training data to true geology, this combination of simulation and generative AI functions offers a flexible prior for probabilistic modeling, regional fine-tuning, and use as an AI-based regularizer in traditional geophysical inversion workflows.

Abstract: Modern language model (LM) training has been divided into multiple stages, making it difficult for downstream developers to evaluate the impact of design choices made at each stage. We present EvoLM, a model suite that enables systematic and transparent analysis of LMs' training dynamics across pre-training, continued pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. We train over 100 LMs with 1B and 4B parameters from scratch, and evaluate both upstream (language modeling) and downstream (problem-solving) capabilities, including considerations of both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Key insights highlight the diminishing returns from excessive pre-training and post-training, the importance and practices of mitigating forgetting during domain-specific continued pre-training, the crucial role of continued pre-training in bridging pre-training and post-training phases, and various intricate trade-offs when configuring supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. To facilitate open research and reproducibility, we release all pre-trained and post-trained models, training datasets for all stages, and our entire training and evaluation pipeline.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training solutions, such as on private data, new modalities, or simply for scientific questioning--which is currently extremely demanding computation-wise. We thus propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve self-supervised learning models robustness.

Abstract: Despite the progress in cross-domain few-shot learning, a model pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new concept, coalescent projection, as an effective successor to soft prompts. Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method, combined with self-supervised transformations, that relies solely on the base domain to prepare the network to encounter unseen samples from different domains. The proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the extreme domain-shift problem of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published at \href{https://github.com/Naeem-Paeedeh/CPLSR}{https://github.com/Naeem-Paeedeh/CPLSR}.

Abstract: While image generation techniques are now capable of producing high-quality images that respect prompts which span multiple sentences, the task of text-guided image editing remains a challenge. Even edit requests that consist of only a few words often fail to be executed correctly. We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.

<title>AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.

Abstract: E-commerce sellers are advised to bid on keyphrases to boost their advertising campaigns. These keyphrases must be relevant to prevent irrelevant items from cluttering search systems and to maintain positive seller perception. It is vital that keyphrase suggestions align with seller, search and buyer judgments. Given the challenges in collecting negative feedback in these systems, LLMs have been used as a scalable proxy to human judgments. This paper presents an empirical study on a major ecommerce platform of a distillation framework involving an LLM teacher, a cross-encoder assistant and a bi-encoder Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) student model, aimed at mitigating click-induced biases in keyphrase recommendations.

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval, and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend explanation evaluation metrics, such as the pointing game and area between the insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations. Experiments on the MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order methods, such as FIxLIP, outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in comparing different models, e.g. CLIP vs. SigLIP-2.

<title>MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

<title>Skill-Aligned Fairness in Multi-Agent Learning for Collaboration in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment. Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics. Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is one of the essential steps to guarantee the convergence of machine learning models. We argue that intuition about the optimal choice of hyperparameters for stochastic gradient descent can be obtained by studying a neural network's phase diagram, in which each phase is characterised by distinctive dynamics of the singular values of weight matrices. Taking inspiration from disordered systems, we start from the observation that the loss landscape of a multilayer neural network with mean squared error can be interpreted as a disordered system in feature space, where the learnt features are mapped to soft spin degrees of freedom, the initial variance of the weight matrices is interpreted as the strength of the disorder, and temperature is given by the ratio of the learning rate and the batch size. As the model is trained, three phases can be identified, in which the dynamics of weight matrices is qualitatively different. Employing a Langevin equation for stochastic gradient descent, previously derived using Dyson Brownian motion, we demonstrate that the three dynamical regimes can be classified effectively, providing practical guidance for the choice of hyperparameters of the optimiser.

Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape; and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven interest in automating cybersecurity penetration testing workflows, offering the promise of faster and more consistent vulnerability assessment for enterprise systems. Existing LLM agents for penetration testing primarily rely on self-guided reasoning, which can produce inaccurate or hallucinated procedural steps. As a result, the LLM agent may undertake unproductive actions, such as exploiting unused software libraries or generating cyclical responses that repeat prior tactics. In this work, we propose a guided reasoning pipeline for penetration testing LLM agents that incorporates a deterministic task tree built from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix, a proven penetration testing kll chain, to constrain the LLM's reaoning process to explicitly defined tactics, techniques, and procedures. This anchors reasoning in proven penetration testing methodologies and filters out ineffective actions by guiding the agent towards more productive attack procedures. To evaluate our approach, we built an automated penetration testing LLM agent using three LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4) and applied it to navigate 10 HackTheBox cybersecurity exercises with 103 discrete subtasks representing real-world cyberattack scenarios. Our proposed reasoning pipeline guided the LLM agent through 71.8\%, 72.8\%, and 78.6\% of subtasks using Llama-3-8B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4, respectively. Comparatively, the state-of-the-art LLM penetration testing tool using self-guided reasoning completed only 13.5\%, 16.5\%, and 75.7\% of subtasks and required 86.2\%, 118.7\%, and 205.9\% more model queries. This suggests that incorporating a deterministic task tree into LLM reasoning pipelines can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of automated cybersecurity assessments

Abstract: We study data-driven least squares (LS) problems with semidefinite (SD) constraints and derive finite-sample guarantees on the spectrum of their optimal solutions when these constraints are relaxed. In particular, we provide a high confidence bound allowing one to solve a simpler program in place of the full SDLS problem, while ensuring that the eigenvalues of the resulting solution are $\varepsilon$-close of those enforced by the SD constraints. The developed certificate, which consistently shrinks as the number of data increases, turns out to be easy-to-compute, distribution-free, and only requires independent and identically distributed samples. Moreover, when the SDLS is used to learn an unknown quadratic function, we establish bounds on the error between a gradient descent iterate minimizing the surrogate cost obtained with no SD constraints and the true minimizer.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models such as BERT have become foundational in NLP, yet their performance degrades in specialized domains like patents, which contain long, technical, and legally structured text. Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.

Abstract: Learning editable high-resolution scene representations for dynamic scenes is an open problem with applications across the domains from autonomous driving to creative editing - the most successful approaches today make a trade-off between editability and supporting scene complexity: neural atlases represent dynamic scenes as two deforming image layers, foreground and background, which are editable in 2D, but break down when multiple objects occlude and interact. In contrast, scene graph models make use of annotated data such as masks and bounding boxes from autonomous-driving datasets to capture complex 3D spatial relationships, but their implicit volumetric node representations are challenging to edit view-consistently. We propose Neural Atlas Graphs (NAGs), a hybrid high-resolution scene representation, where every graph node is a view-dependent neural atlas, facilitating both 2D appearance editing and 3D ordering and positioning of scene elements. Fit at test-time, NAGs achieve state-of-the-art quantitative results on the Waymo Open Dataset - by 5 dB PSNR increase compared to existing methods - and make environmental editing possible in high resolution and visual quality - creating counterfactual driving scenarios with new backgrounds and edited vehicle appearance. We find that the method also generalizes beyond driving scenes and compares favorably - by more than 7 dB in PSNR - to recent matting and video editing baselines on the DAVIS video dataset with a diverse set of human and animal-centric scenes.

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity, and the need for semantic disambiguation. We propose a Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy, especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite being 35 times smaller.

Abstract: Simulating microstructure evolution (MicroEvo) is vital for materials design but demands high numerical accuracy, efficiency, and physical fidelity. Although recent studies on deep learning (DL) offer a promising alternative to traditional solvers, the field lacks standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are flawed due to a lack of comparing specialized MicroEvo DL models with state-of-the-art spatio-temporal architectures, an overemphasis on numerical accuracy over physical fidelity, and a failure to analyze error propagation over time. To address these gaps, we introduce MicroEvoEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for image-based microstructure evolution prediction. We evaluate 14 models, encompassing both domain-specific and general-purpose architectures, across four representative MicroEvo tasks with datasets specifically structured for both short- and long-term assessment. Our multi-faceted evaluation framework goes beyond numerical accuracy and computational cost, incorporating a curated set of structure-preserving metrics to assess physical fidelity. Our extensive evaluations yield several key insights. Notably, we find that modern architectures (e.g., VMamba), not only achieve superior long-term stability and physical fidelity but also operate with an order-of-magnitude greater computational efficiency. The results highlight the necessity of holistic evaluation and identify these modern architectures as a highly promising direction for developing efficient and reliable surrogate models in data-driven materials science.

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) excel at modeling continuous-time dynamics, effectively handling challenges such as irregular observations, missing values, and noise. Despite their advantages, NDEs face a fundamental challenge in adopting dropout, a cornerstone of deep learning regularization, making them susceptible to overfitting. To address this research gap, we introduce Continuum Dropout, a universally applicable regularization technique for NDEs built upon the theory of alternating renewal processes. Continuum Dropout formulates the on-off mechanism of dropout as a stochastic process that alternates between active (evolution) and inactive (paused) states in continuous time. This provides a principled approach to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capabilities of NDEs. Moreover, Continuum Dropout offers a structured framework to quantify predictive uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling at test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Continuum Dropout outperforms existing regularization methods for NDEs, achieving superior performance on various time series and image classification tasks. It also yields better-calibrated and more trustworthy probability estimates, highlighting its effectiveness for uncertainty-aware modeling.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables from satellite imagery is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and agricultural management. In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring. The proposed approach illustrates how integrating physical models with advanced deep networks can improve the inversion of RTMs, opening new prospects for large-scale, physically-constrained remote sensing of vegetation traits.

<div> Keywords: recommender systems, human priors, generative models, beyond-accuracy objectives, adapter heads  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the need to optimize recommender systems not only for accuracy but also for beyond-accuracy objectives such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, which are key to long-term user satisfaction.  
2. It highlights the existence of vast structured domain knowledge called human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns) accumulated by industry practitioners, which is generally applied through post-hoc adjustments but remains separated from core model training.  
3. Existing methods often discard these human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner, and frequently require architecture-specific changes that limit flexibility.  
4. The authors propose a backbone-agnostic framework that integrates human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommender models using lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient large language model decoding techniques.  
5. Their framework enables the model to disentangle user intent along interpretable axes such as interaction types and long- versus short-term interests and introduces a hierarchical composition strategy to model complex interactions across different prior types.  
6. Experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives, showing that human priors facilitate better utilization of longer context lengths and larger model sizes within the backbone model. <div>

Abstract: Optimizing recommender systems for objectives beyond accuracy, such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner. Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.

<div> Drift chambers, cluster counting, machine learning, FPGA, real-time processing<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article addresses the evolving challenges in particle tracking with drift chambers, particularly for future colliders like a Higgs factory which require higher granularity and enhanced particle identification methods. Traditional tracking methods are limited by their data processing capacity when handling the increased data volume from such high-granularity detectors. To overcome this, the authors propose implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms directly at the detector’s cell-level readout, also known as "edge" processing. These ML models perform cluster counting at the source, significantly reducing the data rate that must be handled off-detector. The developed ML algorithms outperform conventional derivative-based techniques in achieving better pion-kaon separation, a critical aspect of particle ID. Moreover, when these algorithms are synthesized to FPGA hardware, they demonstrate low latencies compatible with real-time operation demands of future collider experiments. This advancement not only supports the development of next-generation drift chambers but also contributes to the broader field of hardware-embedded ML applications in high energy physics, opening new opportunities for efficient, fast, and precise detector data processing at the edge. <div>

Abstract: Drift chambers have long been central to collider tracking, but future machines like a Higgs factory motivate higher granularity and cluster counting for particle ID, posing new data processing challenges. Machine learning (ML) at the "edge", or in cell-level readout, can dramatically reduce the off-detector data rate for high-granularity drift chambers by performing cluster counting at-source. We present machine learning algorithms for cluster counting in real-time readout of future drift chambers. These algorithms outperform traditional derivative-based techniques based on achievable pion-kaon separation. When synthesized to FPGA resources, they can achieve latencies consistent with real-time operation in a future Higgs factory scenario, thus advancing both R&amp;D for future collider detectors as well as hardware-based ML for edge applications in high energy physics.

<div> Keywords: Electronic charge density, Floating orbitals, Cartesian tensor network, Rotation equivariance, Density functional theory (DFT)<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper introduces ELECTRA, an equivariant model designed to predict electronic charge densities using the concept of floating orbitals rather than atom-centered orbitals.  
2. Floating orbitals offer a more compact and accurate representation of electronic structures but require expert placement, which has hindered their broader application.  
3. ELECTRA addresses this challenge by employing a Cartesian tensor network trained in a data-driven fashion to predict both the spatial positions of these floating orbitals and their associated coefficients.  
4. A symmetry-breaking mechanism is incorporated to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule, while maintaining rotation equivariance of the resulting charge density.  
5. The model leverages Gaussian orbitals, predicting their weights and covariance matrices inspired by Gaussian Splatting techniques used for spatial density representation.  
6. ELECTRA achieves a state-of-the-art trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy on benchmark datasets.  
7. Importantly, the predicted charge densities can be used to initialize density functional theory (DFT) calculations, resulting in an average reduction of 50.72% in the number of self-consistent field iterations required for convergence on new molecules. <div>

Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using floating orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing concept in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding the ideal placement of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge, though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict the orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussian orbitals and predicting their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks. Furthermore, ELECTRA is able to lower the compute time required to arrive at converged DFT solutions - initializing calculations using our predicted densities yields an average 50.72 % reduction in self-consistent field (SCF) iterations on unseen molecules.

<div> Keywords: empirical scaling laws, spectral framework, learning dynamics, model compression, spectral-temporal elasticity<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses empirical scaling laws that characterize how test loss and performance metrics vary with model size, dataset size, and computational resources. It notes that while such laws hold within particular regimes, different scaling behaviors have been observed in related contexts like model compression. To unify these observations, the authors develop a generalized spectral framework grounded in recent advances in spectral analysis of neural representations. This framework extends the traditional linear spectral evolution function \( g(\lambda t) = \lambda t \) to a more general asymptotically polynomial form \( g(\lambda, t; \beta) \), introducing a novel parameter called spectral-temporal elasticity \(\rho(\beta)\). By doing so, it incorporates both lazy training regimes and feature-learning regimes as special cases, thus bridging previous theoretical models. The generalized formulation reveals an invariant relationship linking learning dynamics and compression effects, providing a unified perspective that captures diverse scaling phenomena. This approach helps explain observed discrepancies in scaling behaviors and offers a flexible theoretical tool for analyzing neural network performance across varying conditions and model modifications such as compression. <div>

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws describe how test loss and other performance metrics depend on model size, dataset size, and compute. While such laws are consistent within specific regimes, apparently distinct scaling behaviors have been reported for related settings such as model compression. Motivated by recent progress in spectral analyses of neural representations, this paper develops a \emph{generalized spectral framework} that unifies learning dynamics and compression phenomena under a common functional ansatz. We generalize the spectral evolution function from the linear kernel form $g(\lambda t)=\lambda t$ to an asymptotically polynomial function $g(\lambda,t;\beta)$, characterized by an effective spectral--temporal elasticity $\rho(\beta)$. This framework recovers existing lazy and feature-learning theories as special cases and yields an invariant relation between learning and compression

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Reward Function, Test-driven Reinforcement Learning, Trajectory Return Function, Multi-objective Optimization

<br /><br />Summary:  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective for robot control tasks but poses challenges in designing reward functions, which can lead to suboptimal task representations. To address this issue, the authors introduce a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework, utilizing multiple test functions instead of a single reward function. These test functions are categorized as pass-fail tests to define optimal goals and indicative tests to guide the learning process. The paper demonstrates that if a trajectory return function prioritizes trajectories closer to an optimal set, optimizing a maximum entropy policy based on this function results in policies more aligned with the optimal outcomes. Additionally, a lexicographic heuristic is presented for assessing the distance between trajectories and the optimal set for the learning of the trajectory return function. An algorithm for implementing TdRL is developed, and experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark show that TdRL matches or surpasses traditional reward methods in training policies. The framework simplifies the design process while intrinsically supporting multi-objective optimization, proposing a fresh perspective for task objective representation to mitigate reward design challenges in RL. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been recognized as a powerful tool for robot control tasks. RL typically employs reward functions to define task objectives and guide agent learning. However, since the reward function serves the dual purpose of defining the optimal goal and guiding learning, it is challenging to design the reward function manually, which often results in a suboptimal task representation. To tackle the reward design challenge in RL, inspired by the satisficing theory, we propose a Test-driven Reinforcement Learning (TdRL) framework. In the TdRL framework, multiple test functions are used to represent the task objective rather than a single reward function. Test functions can be categorized as pass-fail tests and indicative tests, each dedicated to defining the optimal objective and guiding the learning process, respectively, thereby making defining tasks easier. Building upon such a task definition, we first prove that if a trajectory return function assigns higher returns to trajectories closer to the optimal trajectory set, maximum entropy policy optimization based on this return function will yield a policy that is closer to the optimal policy set. Then, we introduce a lexicographic heuristic approach to compare the relative distance relationship between trajectories and the optimal trajectory set for learning the trajectory return function. Furthermore, we develop an algorithm implementation of TdRL. Experimental results on the DeepMind Control Suite benchmark demonstrate that TdRL matches or outperforms handcrafted reward methods in policy training, with greater design simplicity and inherent support for multi-objective optimization. We argue that TdRL offers a novel perspective for representing task objectives, which could be helpful in addressing the reward design challenges in RL applications.

It introduces DTAF, a novel dual-branch framework designed to handle non-stationarity both in the temporal and frequency domains for improved long-term forecasting. In the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module uses a non-stationary mixture of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while maintaining long-term dependencies.

By integrating the outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF can adaptively generate robust forecasts that account for distribution shifts and spectral variability. The approach was tested extensively on real-world benchmarks, where it outperformed state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for decision-making across dynamic domains such as energy, finance, transportation, and cloud computing. However, real-world time series often exhibit non-stationarity, including temporal distribution shifts and spectral variability, which pose significant challenges for long-term time series forecasting. In this paper, we propose DTAF, a dual-branch framework that addresses non-stationarity in both the temporal and frequency domains. For the temporal domain, the Temporal Stabilizing Fusion (TFS) module employs a non-stationary mix of experts (MOE) filter to disentangle and suppress temporal non-stationary patterns while preserving long-term dependencies. For the frequency domain, the Frequency Wave Modeling (FWM) module applies frequency differencing to dynamically highlight components with significant spectral shifts. By fusing the complementary outputs of TFS and FWM, DTAF generates robust forecasts that adapt to both temporal and frequency domain non-stationarity. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DTAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding significant improvements in forecasting accuracy under non-stationary conditions.

<div> Keywords: Gaussian process regression, uncertainty bounds, chaining-based framework, kernel-specific refinements, local uncertainty quantification  

<br /><br />Summary: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a widely-used nonparametric Bayesian method that offers predictive uncertainty estimates, essential for safety-critical applications. Previous research has presented various uncertainty bounds; however, most of these methods require specific input features and depend on posterior statistics or hyperparameter tuning, which limits robustness and fails to capture the global behavior of the model effectively. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on expected extreme values for unseen data without needing specific input features. The authors provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels like RBF and Matérn, ensuring tighter bounds compared to generic approaches. Furthermore, they enhance numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimations, the study presents a novel technique for local uncertainty quantification at designated inputs, using chaining geometry through partition diameters to adapt to local structures without relying on posterior variance scaling. Experimental results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features, and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or the tuning of hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input features. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\'ern, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structures without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<div> Genetics, Phenotype Prediction, Gene Knockout, Multi-label Learning, Interpretability<br /><br />Summary:  
This article addresses the challenge of understanding how genetic sequences influence phenotypes, particularly under gene knockout conditions. It highlights current limitations in predicting multiple phenotype abnormalities from gene sequences due to the complexity of gene-phenotype relationships and the reliance on curated genetic data. The authors introduce GenePheno, a novel interpretable multi-label prediction framework that directly predicts knockout-induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno uses a contrastive multi-label learning objective to capture correlations between multiple phenotypes and applies exclusive regularization to maintain biological consistency in predictions. Additionally, it incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer that provides human interpretable concepts linking gene functions to phenotypic outcomes. To facilitate research in this domain, the study curates four datasets pairing canonical gene sequences with phenotypic abnormalities caused by gene knockouts. Experimental results show that GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art performance on both gene-centric metrics (F_max) and phenotype-centric metrics (AUC). Finally, case studies demonstrate GenePheno’s ability to reveal underlying gene functional mechanisms driving phenotype formation, offering interpretable insights that may guide future biological experimentation and scalable hypothesis testing. <div>

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric $F_{\text{max}}$ and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study challenges the common perception that large language models (LLMs) "know" facts in a human-like manner, clarifying that they store information as probabilistic internal knowledge formed during training. It critically evaluates current probing methods used to determine the truthfulness of statements derived from LLM activations, revealing flawed assumptions underlying these approaches. To overcome these limitations, the authors present sAwMIL (Sparse-Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a novel multiclass framework that integrates multiple-instance learning with conformal prediction to classify statements into true, false, or neither categories by leveraging LLM internal states. The method was tested on 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based models, using three new carefully curated datasets. Key findings include (1) existing probing techniques generally fail to deliver reliable and generalizable directions for veracity and sometimes perform worse than zero-shot prompting; (2) the models encode truth and falsehood asymmetrically rather than in a balanced fashion; and (3) LLMs capture a third distinct signal separate from both true and false, suggesting a more complex internal representation of knowledge than previously recognized. <div>

Abstract: The public often attributes human-like qualities to large language models (LLMs) and assumes they "know" certain things. In reality, LLMs encode information retained during training as internal probabilistic knowledge. This study examines existing methods for probing the veracity of that knowledge and identifies several flawed underlying assumptions. To address these flaws, we introduce sAwMIL (Sparse-Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a multiclass probing framework that combines multiple-instance learning with conformal prediction. sAwMIL leverages internal activations of LLMs to classify statements as true, false, or neither. We evaluate sAwMIL across 16 open-source LLMs, including default and chat-based variants, on three new curated datasets. Our results show that (1) common probing methods fail to provide a reliable and transferable veracity direction and, in some settings, perform worse than zero-shot prompting; (2) truth and falsehood are not encoded symmetrically; and (3) LLMs encode a third type of signal that is distinct from both true and false.

<div> Keywords: Hopfield model, vectorial extension, associative memory, spectral gap, connectivity  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper presents a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model, where each neuron is represented by a unit vector on the sphere \( S^2 \). The synaptic connections are structured as \( 3 \times 3 \) blocks, formed through a vectorial Hebbian learning rule. The derived block-structured operator is analogous to the Hessian used in the study of amorphous solids, creating a rigid energy landscape with pronounced minima for the stored patterns. The authors demonstrate through simulations and spectral analysis that this vectorial model significantly outperforms the traditional binary Hopfield model. They find that the critical storage ratio \( \gamma_c \) increases roughly linearly with the coordination number \( Z \) in moderate connectivity scenarios. When \( Z \) exceeds approximately 40, a high-connectivity regime emerges where \( \gamma_c \) consistently surpasses the low \( Z \) linear extrapolation. Additionally, a persistent spectral gap is observed, which facilitates the separation of pattern modes from the bulk, leading to larger basins of attraction and enhanced resilience against initialization noise. The results indicate that integrating geometric constraints with amorphous-solid-like structures yields superior associative memory performance, particularly for high-connectivity ( \( Z \gtrsim 20-30 \) ) scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.

<div> Keywords: projection methods, convex quadratic programs, active set, learning guarantees, dimensionality reduction

<br /><br />Summary: This article discusses projection methods designed to enhance the scalability of high-dimensional optimization problems by reducing their dimensionality. It focuses on a recent data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs) proposed by Sakaue and Oki, which learns the projection matrix from observed problem instances. The authors analyze this approach's generalization guarantees when applied to convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not limited to the vertices of their feasible regions, complicating the analysis of their optimal value function. To address this, the authors utilize Caratheodory's theorem to show that convex QP solutions can be localized within a feasible region defined by a specific active set. They introduce the unrolled active set method, which models the optimal value computation as a Goldberg-Jerrum algorithm with bounded complexities, providing learning guarantees. Furthermore, the analysis extends to various scenarios, including frameworks for learning to achieve optimal solutions and an input-aware approach that learns mappings from QP instances to projection matrices. This research establishes a foundation for improving QP optimization through data-driven methodologies. <div>

Abstract: Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.

<div> Keywords: Curse of dimensionality, Adaptive sampling, Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling, Quasi-Monte Carlo, High-dimensional optimization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The article addresses the challenge posed by the curse of dimensionality in optimization, where the search space expands exponentially, making traditional algorithms inefficient. It introduces an adaptive sampling technique called Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), designed to accelerate optimization in high-dimensional spaces by providing an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling methods. HDS works by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the parameter space and employs three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to avoid expensive high-dimensional geometric computations. This results in an intelligent, non-uniform sampling sequence that targets statistically promising regions, enhancing the quality of final optimization solutions. A notable feature of HDS is the option to incorporate Gaussian weights, allowing the sample distribution to focus on known areas of interest, thus broadening its applicability beyond optimization tasks. The method was benchmarked against the Sobol QMC method using differential evolution on 29 CEC2017 test functions. The experimental results demonstrated statistically significant improvements in solution accuracy, with p-values less than 0.05, and performance gains ranging from 3% in 30 dimensions to 37% in 10 dimensions. Overall, the paper establishes HDS as a robust and effective alternative to traditional QMC techniques for solving high-dimensional optimization problems. <div>

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality presents a pervasive challenge in optimization problems, with exponential expansion of the search space rapidly causing traditional algorithms to become inefficient or infeasible. An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.
  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.
  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of HDS as a robust alternative to QMC sampling for high-dimensional optimization.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, model extraction attacks, watermarking, Class-Feature Watermarks, resilience  

<br /><br />Summary: Machine learning models are valuable assets but can be subjected to model extraction attacks (MEA) where adversaries replicate their functionality. To counter MEAs, model watermarking is employed, embedding markers for ownership verification. However, existing watermarks focus mainly on surviving MEAs by using representation entanglement but fail to address resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. This study uncovers the underestimation of risks as current removal techniques are vulnerable due to entanglement. To address this, the authors introduce Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which effectively diminishes watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across various benchmarks. For enhanced protection, they propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW) that utilize class-level artifacts and create synthetic classes using out-of-domain samples. This approach helps eliminate weak decision boundaries between original and artifact-modified samples. CFW optimizes the transferability of MEA and ensures stability after MEA outcomes. Experimental results across different domains indicate that CFW outperforms existing methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% even under both MEA and WRK distortions, while also preserving the utility of the protected models. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning models constitute valuable intellectual property, yet remain vulnerable to model extraction attacks (MEA), where adversaries replicate their functionality through black-box queries. Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.
  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models.

<div> Keywords: AI system, negative flips, margin-calibration, image classification, focal distillation loss

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the challenge of minimizing inconsistencies across versions of AI models, focusing on image classification. A significant issue identified is "negative flips," where updated models misclassify previously correctly identified samples, particularly as the number of training classes increases. The authors propose a novel method to mitigate negative flips by preserving the margins of the original model while allowing the learning of new classes. This approach involves introducing a margin-calibration term that maintains a larger relative margin between old and new classes. However, the proposed method also recognizes the potential negative impact on the accuracy of new classes if their logit margins are overly constrained, compared to an independently trained model. To balance this, the approach integrates a double-source focal distillation loss that draws from both the previous model and a new independently trained model. This enables the learning of an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even with logit margin calibration in place. Extensive experimental results on various image classification benchmarks indicate that this approach effectively reduces the rate of negative flips while maintaining high overall accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2511.08322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimizing inconsistencies across successive versions of an AI system is as crucial as reducing the overall error. In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy.

<div> Keywords: world model, video generation, action-conditioned, long-horizon, simulation  

<br /><br />Summary: The article presents PAN, a novel world model designed for intelligent agents that enables them to predict and reason about future states based on their actions. Unlike existing video generation models, which typically produce sequences in a linear fashion without causal control or long-term coherence, PAN allows for interactive and effective long-horizon simulations. It addresses the limitations of current world modeling efforts that focus on narrow domains by providing a generalizable approach that spans diverse environments. PAN integrates the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture, which utilizes an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone powered by a large language model. This approach grounds its simulations in a wealth of text-based knowledge and allows conditioning on language-specified actions. Additionally, PAN incorporates a video diffusion decoder to produce high-quality, temporally coherent visual outputs. Trained on extensive video-action pair datasets, PAN excels in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning, outperforming existing video generators and world models. The work represents a significant advancement towards creating general world models that support predictive simulation for intelligent reasoning and action. <div>
arXiv:2511.09057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

<div> Keywords: AI alignment, model raising, training corpus, social interactions, human values

<br /><br />Summary: The article critiques current AI training methods, which typically align models with human values only after core capabilities are established, leading to potential misalignment. It introduces a new paradigm called "model raising," where alignment is integrated from the outset of a model's development. Key components include redesigning the training corpus by reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experiences, simulating social interactions, and carefully scaffolding the ordering of training data. This approach aims for an early commitment to values from the very first training token, making the intertwining of knowledge, skills, and values more intrinsic and harder to separate. The authors argue that in a rapidly evolving landscape where large language models may surpass human capabilities in various tasks, implementing this paradigm shift is essential for fostering AI systems that inherently align with human values throughout their learning process. <div>
arXiv:2511.09287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, differential geometry, softmax, entropy, information geometry

<br /><br />Summary: This article establishes a connection between machine learning and modern differential geometry, specifically through the logits-to-probabilities transition achieved by the softmax function. The authors model this transition as a geometric interface where two potential-generated, conservative descriptions converge along a Legendrian "seam" within a contact screen, represented by the probability simplex, situated in a folded symplectic collar. They identify bias-shift invariance as Reeb flow along the contact screen. Additionally, they introduce the Fenchel-Young equality and KL gap as a computable measure of distance to this seam. The paper offers concrete examples in the contexts of two- and three-class classification problems to illustrate their concepts. Moreover, the authors suggest future directions for machine learning research, including the development of compact logit models (both projective and spherical) and the exploration of global invariants. They also emphasize their potential connections to information geometry, where the dynamics occurring in the described geometric framework can be understood as replicator flows. This work serves as a significant initial step towards bridging machine learning with geometric principles. <div>
arXiv:2511.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note offers a first bridge from machine learning to modern differential geometry. We show that the logits-to-probabilities step implemented by softmax can be modeled as a geometric interface: two potential-generated, conservative descriptions (from negative entropy and log-sum-exp) meet along a Legendrian "seam" on a contact screen (the probability simplex) inside a simple folded symplectic collar. Bias-shift invariance appears as Reeb flow on the screen, and the Fenchel-Young equality/KL gap provides a computable distance to the seam. We work out the two- and three-class cases to make the picture concrete and outline next steps for ML: compact logit models (projective or spherical), global invariants, and connections to information geometry where on-screen dynamics manifest as replicator flows.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, M-RARU, Classification Accuracy

<br /><br />Summary:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective in classification tasks but are hindered by high computational and financial costs, particularly in dynamic settings. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a method where a larger "teacher" model trains a smaller "student" model to reduce costs. However, the distillation process can be expensive as it requires the teacher to label many samples, leading to excessive token consumption. To address this issue, the authors introduce M-RARU (Multi-class Randomized Accept/Reject Uncertainty Sampling), a novel Active Learning (AL) approach designed to create efficient student models at a lower cost while maintaining LLM performance. M-RARU strategically combines uncertainty with a randomized accept-reject mechanism, selecting only the most informative data points, thereby minimizing API calls and data processing times. The effectiveness of M-RARU is evaluated against random sampling using five diverse student models (SVM, LDA, RF, GBDT, and DistilBERT) across multiple benchmark datasets. The experimental results reveal that M-RARU can achieve up to an 80% reduction in sample requirements compared to random sampling, significantly enhancing classification accuracy while decreasing financial costs and overall training duration. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly accurate in classification tasks, however, substantial computational and financial costs hinder their large-scale deployment in dynamic environments. Knowledge Distillation (KD) where a LLM "teacher" trains a smaller and more efficient "student" model, offers a promising solution to this problem. However, the distillation process itself often remains costly for large datasets, since it requires the teacher to label a vast number of samples while incurring significant token consumption. To alleviate this challenge, in this work we explore the active learning (AL) as a way to create efficient student models at a fraction of the cost while preserving the LLM's performance. In particular, we introduce M-RARU (Multi-class Randomized Accept/Reject Uncertainty Sampling), a novel AL algorithm that significantly reduces training costs. M-RARU employs an innovative strategy combining uncertainty with a randomized accept-reject mechanism to select only the most informative data points for the LLM teacher. This focused approach significantly minimizes required API calls and data processing time. We evaluate M-RARU against random sampling across five diverse student models (SVM, LDA, RF, GBDT, and DistilBERT) on multiple benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 80% reduction in sample requirements as compared to random sampling, substantially improving classification accuracy while reducing financial costs and overall training time.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, algorithmic fairness, statistical significance, recidivism forecasting, bias

<br /><br />Summary: 
The paper addresses the growing concern over algorithmic fairness as machine learning algorithms are adopted in critical sectors like finance and healthcare. It critiques the current literature for lacking methods to determine whether disparities between privileged and protected groups are statistically significant or merely coincidental. To address this gap, the authors provide a robust framework that employs k-fold cross-validation to establish sampling distributions of fairness metrics. This framework is complemented by statistical tests that help identify meaningful violations of fairness, examining disparities in predicted vs. actual outcomes, model calibration, and employing causal inference techniques. The authors apply their methodology to recidivism forecasting algorithms sourced from the National Institute of Justice. Their findings indicate a statistically significant bias against Black individuals across multiple fairness definitions, while revealing varied results concerning White individuals. This underscores the necessity for thorough statistical evaluations when judging the fairness of algorithmic decision-making systems. The paper emphasizes that a rigorous approach is essential to ensure fairness in AI applications, ultimately advancing the discourse around ethical AI practices. <div>
arXiv:2511.11575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly deployed in critical domains such as finance, healthcare, and criminal justice [1]. The increasing popularity of algorithmic decision-making has stimulated interest in algorithmic fairness within the academic community. Researchers have introduced various fairness definitions that quantify disparities between privileged and protected groups, use causal inference to determine the impact of race on model predictions, and that test calibration of probability predictions from the model. Existing literature does not provide a way in which to assess whether observed disparities between groups are statistically significant or merely due to chance. This paper introduces a rigorous framework for testing the statistical significance of fairness violations by leveraging k-fold cross-validation [2] to generate sampling distributions of fairness metrics. This paper introduces statistical tests that can be used to identify statistically significant violations of fairness metrics based on disparities between predicted and actual outcomes, model calibration, and causal inference techniques [1]. We demonstrate this approach by testing recidivism forecasting algorithms trained on data from the National Institute of Justice. Our findings reveal that machine learning algorithms used for recidivism forecasting exhibit statistically significant bias against Black individuals under several fairness definitions, while also exhibiting no bias or bias against White individuals under other definitions. The results from this paper underscore the importance of rigorous and robust statistical testing while evaluating algorithmic decision-making systems.

<br /><br />Summary:  
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly propelled research in automated optimization modeling. Traditionally, much of the focus has been on deterministic optimization with well-known parameters, neglecting the complexities introduced by uncertainty in real-world decision-making. This paper proposes the DAOpt framework, which addresses this gap by introducing a novel dataset called OptU tailored for uncertain settings. Additionally, the framework encompasses a multi-agent decision-making module and a simulation environment designed to evaluate LLMs on criteria such as out-of-sample feasibility and robustness. By integrating few-shot learning techniques, the authors enhance the modeling prowess of LLMs by incorporating domain knowledge derived from stochastic and robust optimization. This holistic approach not only expands the applicability of LLMs in uncertain decision-making scenarios but also sets the stage for future studies to further explore and leverage LLM capabilities in optimization. <div>

<div> Keywords: Rotary Positional Encoding, Transformers, attention heads, positional information, model behavior

<br /><br />Summary: The paper investigates the encoding of positional and symbolic information in Transformers, focusing specifically on Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) and its effectiveness. It introduces general definitions for classifying attention head behavior as positional or symbolic, proving that these behaviors are mutually exclusive. A new metric is developed to quantify these behaviors, allowing for a deeper analysis of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) that utilize RoPE. The study finds a strong correspondence between the behavior of attention heads and their frequency usage. To further explore these behaviors, the authors design canonical tasks that are purely positional or symbolic, revealing a causal relationship between Transformer performance and the appropriate leveraging of frequencies by attention heads. The results indicate that regulating access to specific frequencies can control the performance of the Transformer. Overall, the work deepens the understanding of RoPE and its implications for Transformer model behavior, demonstrating the importance of differentiating between positional and symbolic information during language processing. <div>
arXiv:2511.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important aspect subtending language understanding and production is the ability to independently encode positional and symbolic information of the words within a sentence. In Transformers, positional information is typically encoded using Positional Encodings (PEs). One such popular PE, namely Rotary PE (RoPE), has been widely used due to its empirical success. Recently, it has been argued that part of RoPE's success emerges from its ability to encode robust positional and semantic information using large and small frequencies, respectively. In this work, we perform a deeper dive into the positional versus symbolic dichotomy of attention heads behavior, both at the theoretical and empirical level. We provide general definitions of what it means for a head to behave positionally or symbolically, prove that these are two mutually exclusive behaviors and develop a metric to quantify them. We apply our framework to analyze Transformer-based LLMs using RoPE and find that all heads exhibit a strong correspondence between behavior and frequency use. Finally, we introduce canonical tasks designed to be either purely positional or symbolic, and demonstrate that the Transformer performance causally relates to the ability of attention heads to leverage the appropriate frequencies. In particular, we show that we can control the Transformer performance by controlling which frequencies the attention heads can access. Altogether, our work provides a detailed understanding of RoPE, and how its properties relate to model behavior.

Abstract: A long-standing goal in both industry and academia is to develop an LLM inference platform that is portable across hardware architectures, eliminates the need for low-level hand-tuning, and still delivers best-in-class efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that portable, efficient cross-platform LLM inference is indeed possible and share our experience. We develop a state-of-the-art paged attention kernel, the core performance-critical component of many LLM deployments, that builds exclusively on the domain-specific just-in-time compiled language Triton to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. We describe our high-level approach, the key algorithmic and system-level improvements, the parameter auto-tuning required to unlock efficiency, and the integrations into a popular inference server that are necessary to bring the performance of a generic Triton attention kernel from 19.7% of the state-of-the-art to 105.9%. Our results highlight how open-source domain-specific languages can be leveraged to unlock model portability across different GPU vendors.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Financial Recommendations, Knowledge Graphs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Behavioral Alignment

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses limitations of large language models (LLMs) in personalized financial recommendations, particularly their restricted context window, hallucination issues, and insufficient behavioral grounding. Building on the authors' prior work, FLARKO, which integrates structured knowledge graphs (KGs) into LLM prompts to better align advice with user behavior and market data, the authors introduce RAG-FLARKO, a retrieval-augmented extension designed to enhance scalability and relevance. RAG-FLARKO employs a multi-stage and parallel KG retrieval approach: it first extracts behaviorally relevant entities from a user’s transaction KG, then filters temporally consistent signals from a market KG using this retrieved context. This process constructs a compact, contextually grounded subgraph supplied to the LLM, reducing context overhead while focusing the model on pertinent information. Empirical evaluation on a real-world financial transaction dataset demonstrates that RAG-FLARKO significantly improves recommendation quality. Importantly, the framework allows smaller and more efficient language models to perform effectively in terms of profitability and behavioral alignment. This makes RAG-FLARKO a promising approach for deploying grounded financial AI systems in environments with limited computational resources. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for personalized financial recommendations but are hampered by context limits, hallucinations, and a lack of behavioral grounding. Our prior work, FLARKO, embedded structured knowledge graphs (KGs) in LLM prompts to align advice with user behavior and market data. This paper introduces RAG-FLARKO, a retrieval-augmented extension to FLARKO, that overcomes scalability and relevance challenges using multi-stage and parallel KG retrieval processes. Our method first retrieves behaviorally relevant entities from a user's transaction KG and then uses this context to filter temporally consistent signals from a market KG, constructing a compact, grounded subgraph for the LLM. This pipeline reduces context overhead and sharpens the model's focus on relevant information. Empirical evaluation on a real-world financial transaction dataset demonstrates that RAG-FLARKO significantly enhances recommendation quality. Notably, our framework enables smaller, more efficient models to achieve high performance in both profitability and behavioral alignment, presenting a viable path for deploying grounded financial AI in resource-constrained environments.

<div> Obfuscated chain of thought, monitorability, safe-looking outputs, training generalization, mitigation strategies  

<br /><br />Summary:  
OpenAI (2025) identified that training language models against a chain of thought (CoT) monitor can result in obfuscated CoTs that hide undesirable behavior, which the monitor fails to detect. To counter this, OpenAI proposed restricting training to output monitors that do not access CoTs, aiming to keep CoTs monitorable. This paper demonstrates that such a training approach can still produce obfuscated CoTs through two mechanisms. First, models trained to generate safe-looking outputs may generalize this safety to their CoTs, causing the reasoning itself to appear safe despite underlying issues. Second, because later tokens depend on earlier ones, the presence of safe-looking CoTs can increase the likelihood of safe final outputs, effectively reinforcing the creation of deceptively safe CoTs. To address these challenges, the authors introduce two mitigation techniques targeting these specific mechanisms. These mitigations lead to an improved balance, achieving a Pareto improvement by enhancing both the monitorability of CoTs and the model’s task performance compared to standard training methods. This work highlights the nuanced risks involved in training with CoT monitors and proposes practical solutions to maintain transparency and safety in model reasoning processes. <div>

Abstract: OpenAI (2025) showed that training against a chain of thought (CoT) monitor can cause obfuscated CoTs, which contain bad behavior the monitor cannot detect. They proposed to keep CoTs monitorable by training only against output monitors that do not have access to CoT. We show that such training can still cause obfuscated CoTs via two mechanisms. First, when a model is trained to produce a safe-looking output, that model may generalize to making its CoTs look safe. Second, since later tokens are conditioned on earlier ones, safe-looking CoTs may increase the likelihood of safe outputs, causing safe-looking CoTs to be reinforced. We introduce two mitigations to address these two issues, which achieve a Pareto improvement in terms of monitorability and task performance compared to regular training.

<div> Keywords: FedGen-Edge, federated learning, generative models, Low-Rank Adaptation, personalization

<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces FedGen-Edge, a framework designed to enhance the training and adaptation of large generative models in federated settings, addressing challenges posed by computation, communication, and statistical/system heterogeneity. The approach utilizes a frozen, pre-trained global backbone along with lightweight client-side adapters, allowing only the adapters to be federated. By employing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), client updates are constrained to a compact subspace, which significantly reduces uplink traffic by over 99% compared to traditional full-model FedAvg. Additionally, the method stabilizes aggregation in scenarios involving non-IID data and supports personalization, as each client retains a locally tuned adapter. The framework demonstrates lower perplexity and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores along with faster convergence on language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10) tasks compared to strong existing baselines while maintaining the simplicity of a FedAvg-style server. An ablation study indicates that there are diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and highlights a trade-off between local training epochs and client drift. Overall, FedGen-Edge presents a viable solution for deploying privacy-preserving, resource-efficient, and personalized generative AI on diverse edge devices. <div>

Abstract: Large generative models (for example, language and diffusion models) enable high-quality text and image synthesis but are hard to train or adapt in cross-device federated settings due to heavy computation and communication and statistical/system heterogeneity. We propose FedGen-Edge, a framework that decouples a frozen, pre-trained global backbone from lightweight client-side adapters and federates only the adapters. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrains client updates to a compact subspace, which reduces uplink traffic by more than 99 percent versus full-model FedAvg, stabilizes aggregation under non-IID data, and naturally supports personalization because each client can keep a locally tuned adapter. On language modeling (PTB) and image generation (CIFAR-10), FedGen-Edge achieves lower perplexity/FID and faster convergence than strong baselines while retaining a simple FedAvg-style server. A brief ablation shows diminishing returns beyond moderate LoRA rank and a trade-off between local epochs and client drift. FedGen-Edge offers a practical path toward privacy-preserving, resource-aware, and personalized generative AI on heterogeneous edge devices.

<div> wildfire risk, machine learning, Random Forest, wildfire indicators, interpretability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper presents WildfireGenome, a novel approach to wildfire risk assessment that improves interpretability and decision-scale relevance compared to existing coarse hazard maps and opaque machine learning models. First, it fuses seven federal wildfire risk indicators into a sign-aligned composite risk label using principal component analysis (PCA) at fine spatial resolution (H3 Level-8). Second, a Random Forest classifier is trained on these labels to predict local wildfire risk across ecologically diverse U.S. counties with accuracy ranging from 0.755 to 0.878 and Quadratic Weighted Kappa up to 0.951, while principal components explain 87-94% of indicator variance. Third, interpretability is enhanced through SHAP and ICE/PDP analyses, revealing county-specific nonlinear relationships between wildfire risk and environmental drivers. Across regions, needleleaf forest cover and elevation consistently emerge as dominant risk drivers, with wildfire risk increasing steeply when needleleaf coverage exceeds 30-40%. Model transferability tests indicate reliable performance between ecologically similar regions but significant degradation in unrelated contexts. Overall, WildfireGenome advances wildfire risk assessment by providing interpretable, locally detailed analytics that can inform vegetation management, zoning policies, and infrastructure planning to better mitigate wildfire hazards. <div>
arXiv:2511.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current wildfire risk assessments rely on coarse hazard maps and opaque machine learning models that optimize regional accuracy while sacrificing interpretability at the decision scale. WildfireGenome addresses these gaps through three components: (1) fusion of seven federal wildfire indicators into a sign-aligned, PCA-based composite risk label at H3 Level-8 resolution; (2) Random Forest classification of local wildfire risk; and (3) SHAP and ICE/PDP analyses to expose county-specific nonlinear driver relationships. Across seven ecologically diverse U.S. counties, models achieve accuracies of 0.755-0.878 and Quadratic Weighted Kappa up to 0.951, with principal components explaining 87-94% of indicator variance. Transfer tests show reliable performance between ecologically similar regions but collapse across dissimilar contexts. Explanations consistently highlight needleleaf forest cover and elevation as dominant drivers, with risk rising sharply at 30-40% needleleaf coverage. WildfireGenome advances wildfire risk assessment from regional prediction to interpretable, decision-scale analytics that guide vegetation management, zoning, and infrastructure planning.

<div> Keywords: maximum entropy, reinforcement learning, trajectory entropy, Q-value estimation, off-policy algorithm  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses key limitations in maximum entropy reinforcement learning, specifically the instability caused by jointly updating Q-values and the temperature parameter, and the short-sighted nature of local entropy tuning. To overcome these, the authors propose the Trajectory Entropy-Constrained Reinforcement Learning (TECRL) framework, which introduces separate Q-functions for rewards and entropy. This separation stabilizes value target estimation by decoupling temperature updates from reward learning. Additionally, the entropy Q-function quantifies expected cumulative entropy, enabling the imposition of a trajectory-level entropy constraint that controls policy stochasticity over the long term, rather than just at individual steps. Based on TECRL, the authors develop an off-policy algorithm called DSAC-E by refining the distributional soft actor-critic method with three specific improvements, termed DSAC-T. Experimental evaluation on OpenAI Gym benchmarks demonstrates that DSAC-E outperforms existing methods by achieving higher returns and improved training stability. Overall, this work extends maximum entropy RL frameworks by addressing non-stationarity and local entropy tuning issues through trajectory-level entropy considerations and separate Q-function learning, resulting in a more stable and effective off-policy RL algorithm. <div>
arXiv:2511.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum entropy has become a mainstream off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) framework for balancing exploitation and exploration. However, two bottlenecks still limit further performance improvement: (1) non-stationary Q-value estimation caused by jointly injecting entropy and updating its weighting parameter, i.e., temperature; and (2) short-sighted local entropy tuning that adjusts temperature only according to the current single-step entropy, without considering the effect of cumulative entropy over time. In this paper, we extends maximum entropy framework by proposing a trajectory entropy-constrained reinforcement learning (TECRL) framework to address these two challenges. Within this framework, we first separately learn two Q-functions, one associated with reward and the other with entropy, ensuring clean and stable value targets unaffected by temperature updates. Then, the dedicated entropy Q-function, explicitly quantifying the expected cumulative entropy, enables us to enforce a trajectory entropy constraint and consequently control the policy long-term stochasticity. Building on this TECRL framework, we develop a practical off-policy algorithm, DSAC-E, by extending the state-of-the-art distributional soft actor-critic with three refinements (DSAC-T). Empirical results on the OpenAI Gym benchmark demonstrate that our DSAC-E can achieve higher returns and better stability.

<div> Graph neural networks, knowledge graph completion, mean aggregation, non-negative weights, logical rules<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper studies graph neural networks (GNNs) that use mean aggregation functions with non-negative weights, referred to as MAGNNs, in the context of knowledge graph completion. The authors identify the exact class of monotonic logical rules that can soundly explain MAGNN predictions, addressing a gap in explainability for mean-aggregation GNNs. They also define a restricted fragment of first-order logic that can characterize any prediction made by MAGNNs, providing a theoretical basis for understanding these models. Experimentally, the paper shows that constraining mean-aggregation GNNs to non-negative weights results in performance that is comparable or better on standard inductive benchmarks, suggesting that this restriction does not harm predictive capability. Moreover, the study demonstrates that sound logical rules can indeed be extracted in practical scenarios, enabling insightful explanations for the model's behavior. Finally, the extracted sound rules can reveal weaknesses or issues in the trained models, offering a tool for diagnosing and improving GNNs. This work contributes both theoretical insights and practical techniques for enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of GNNs in knowledge graph completion tasks. <div>
arXiv:2511.11593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are frequently used for knowledge graph completion. Their black-box nature has motivated work that uses sound logical rules to explain predictions and characterise their expressivity. However, despite the prevalence of GNNs that use mean as an aggregation function, explainability and expressivity results are lacking for them. We consider GNNs with mean aggregation and non-negative weights (MAGNNs), proving the precise class of monotonic rules that can be sound for them, as well as providing a restricted fragment of first-order logic to explain any MAGNN prediction. Our experiments show that restricting mean-aggregation GNNs to have non-negative weights yields comparable or improved performance on standard inductive benchmarks, that sound rules are obtained in practice, that insightful explanations can be generated in practice, and that the sound rules can expose issues in the trained models.

<div> Keywords: Loss Given Default, LGD modeling, recursive partitioning, mutual information, financial institutions

<br /><br />Summary: Loss Given Default (LGD) modeling faces a significant data quality challenge, as 90% of available training data consists of proxy estimates instead of actual recovery outcomes from bankruptcies. This mixture-contaminated training data leads to systematic failures in recursive partitioning methods, illustrated by Random Forest achieving a negative r-squared of -0.664 on held-out test data. In contrast, information-theoretic approaches that utilize Shannon entropy and mutual information demonstrate better generalization, with an r-squared of 0.191 and RMSE of 0.284 over 1,218 corporate bankruptcies spanning from 1980 to 2023. The analysis highlights that leverage-based features provide 1.510 bits of mutual information, while size effects contribute a mere 0.086 bits, challenging regulatory assumptions about scale-dependent recovery. The findings offer practical guidance for financial institutions deploying LGD models under Basel III requirements when sufficient representative outcome data is scarce. Additionally, the results have implications for other fields, such as medical outcomes research, climate forecasting, and technology reliability, where extended observation periods can lead to similar mixture structures in training data. <div>

Abstract: Loss Given Default (LGD) modeling faces a fundamental data quality constraint: 90% of available training data consists of proxy estimates based on pre-distress balance sheets rather than actual recovery outcomes from completed bankruptcy proceedings. We demonstrate that this mixture-contaminated training structure causes systematic failure of recursive partitioning methods, with Random Forest achieving negative r-squared (-0.664, worse than predicting the mean) on held-out test data. Information-theoretic approaches based on Shannon entropy and mutual information provide superior generalization, achieving r-squared of 0.191 and RMSE of 0.284 on 1,218 corporate bankruptcies (1980-2023). Analysis reveals that leverage-based features contain 1.510 bits of mutual information while size effects contribute only 0.086 bits, contradicting regulatory assumptions about scale-dependent recovery. These results establish practical guidance for financial institutions deploying LGD models under Basel III requirements when representative outcome data is unavailable at sufficient scale. The findings generalize to medical outcomes research, climate forecasting, and technology reliability-domains where extended observation periods create unavoidable mixture structure in training data.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement learning, Nash equilibria, Aspiration-based learning, Stochastic stability, Multi-player games

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the limitations of reinforcement-based learning in distributed setups, particularly in multi-player weakly-acyclic games. While such learning methods can effectively filter out noise, they struggle to guarantee convergence to desirable pure Nash equilibria when players act independently. Previous research has mainly focused on potential and coordination games, leaving a gap in understanding broader game dynamics. To tackle this, the authors introduce aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA), a novel payoff-based learning scheme designed for distributed optimization. In APLA, players adjust their action selection probabilities based on a combination of past selections and an aspiration factor that reflects their satisfaction. The study conducts a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in the context of multi-player positive-utility games while accounting for noisy observations. Importantly, the paper establishes a relationship between an infinite-dimensional Markov chain and a finite-dimensional counterpart, which enhances the understanding of stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games. Additionally, the findings are specialized to examine the dynamics within weakly acyclic games, expanding the theoretical framework for understanding player behavior in complex strategic environments. <div>
arXiv:2511.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement-based learning has attracted considerable attention both in modeling human behavior as well as in engineering, for designing measurement- or payoff-based optimization schemes. Such learning schemes exhibit several advantages, especially in relation to filtering out noisy observations. However, they may exhibit several limitations when applied in a distributed setup. In multi-player weakly-acyclic games, and when each player applies an independent copy of the learning dynamics, convergence to (usually desirable) pure Nash equilibria cannot be guaranteed. Prior work has only focused on a small class of games, namely potential and coordination games. To address this main limitation, this paper introduces a novel payoff-based learning scheme for distributed optimization, namely aspiration-based perturbed learning automata (APLA). In this class of dynamics, and contrary to standard reinforcement-based learning schemes, each player's probability distribution for selecting actions is reinforced both by repeated selection and an aspiration factor that captures the player's satisfaction level. We provide a stochastic stability analysis of APLA in multi-player positive-utility games under the presence of noisy observations. This is the first part of the paper that characterizes stochastic stability in generic non-zero-sum games by establishing equivalence of the induced infinite-dimensional Markov chain with a finite dimensional one. In the second part, stochastic stability is further specialized to weakly acyclic games.

<div> Keywords: Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, predictive maintenance, nuclear industry, data-driven methodologies  

<br /><br />Summary: The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 has significantly improved data-driven approaches within the nuclear industry, enhancing both safety and economic efficiency. This progress presents challenges in accurately predicting future maintenance requirements, which is essential for minimizing downtime and operational costs. The efficacy of data-driven methods in nuclear settings relies heavily on extensive domain knowledge due to the complexity of the systems. This paper proposes an innovative predictive maintenance methodology that integrates data-driven techniques with specialized knowledge from nuclear equipment. The originality of this research is twofold: it exposes the limitations of solely data-driven methods and emphasizes the critical role of domain knowledge in improving predictive model performance. The applied novelty is evident in its relevance to the highly regulated and sensitive nuclear industry, which faces significant security, economic, and environmental issues. A comprehensive case study highlights the methodology’s superiority over traditional approaches, showing that while data-driven methods have a limited prediction horizon of 3 hours and an F1 score of 56.36%, the hybrid approach extends the prediction horizon to 24 hours and achieves an F1 score of 93.12%. <div>

Abstract: The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 has significantly enhanced data-driven methodologies within the nuclear industry, notably enhancing safety and economic efficiency. This advancement challenges the precise prediction of future maintenance needs for assets, which is crucial for reducing downtime and operational costs. However, the effectiveness of data-driven methodologies in the nuclear sector requires extensive domain knowledge due to the complexity of the systems involved. Thus, this paper proposes a novel predictive maintenance methodology that combines data-driven techniques with domain knowledge from a nuclear equipment. The methodological originality of this paper is located on two levels: highlighting the limitations of purely data-driven approaches and demonstrating the importance of knowledge in enhancing the performance of the predictive models. The applicative novelty of this work lies in its use within a domain such as a nuclear industry, which is highly restricted and ultrasensitive due to security, economic and environmental concerns. A detailed real-world case study which compares the current state of equipment monitoring with two scenarios, demonstrate that the methodology significantly outperforms purely data-driven methods in failure prediction. While purely data-driven methods achieve only a modest performance with a prediction horizon limited to 3 h and a F1 score of 56.36%, the hybrid approach increases the prediction horizon to 24 h and achieves a higher F1 score of 93.12%.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant advancements, achieving superhuman performance in various tasks. However, RL agents often operate under the assumption of environmental stationarity, which poses a great challenge to learning efficiency since many environments are inherently non-stationary. This non-stationarity results in the requirement of millions of iterations, leading to low sample efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Clustering Orthogonal Weight Modified (COWM) layer, which can be integrated into the policy network of any RL algorithm and mitigate non-stationarity effectively. The COWM layer stabilizes the learning process by employing clustering techniques and a projection matrix. Our approach not only improves learning speed but also reduces gradient interference, thereby enhancing the overall learning efficiency. Empirically, the COWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves improvements of 9% and 12.6% in vision based and state-based DMControl benchmark. It also shows robustness and generality across various algorithms and tasks.

<div> Keywords: Tokenization, Transfer Learning, Time Series, Model Performance, Pretraining  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This work investigates how tokenizer design affects time series foundation models, focusing on scaling and quantization strategies. It highlights that the configuration of tokenizers is crucial for the model's representational capacity and stability. The study contrasts the impact of pretraining versus random initialization, revealing that pretrained models benefit significantly from well-designed tokenizers, especially when using smaller vocabulary sizes. Additionally, it emphasizes that ineffective tokenization may reduce or negate the advantages of pretraining. The findings underscore the necessity of meticulous tokenization for effective time series modeling. Furthermore, incorporating small, efficient vocabularies alongside pretrained weights is particularly beneficial in multi-modal forecasting scenarios where a shared vocabulary across various modalities is essential. The paper provides actionable recommendations for designing tokenizers and effectively utilizing transfer learning within discrete representation learning for continuous signals, ultimately guiding practitioners in optimizing their forecasting models. <div>

Abstract: Tokenization and transfer learning are two critical components in building state of the art time series foundation models for forecasting. In this work, we systematically study the effect of tokenizer design, specifically scaling and quantization strategies, on model performance, alongside the impact of pretraining versus random initialization. We show that tokenizer configuration primarily governs the representational capacity and stability of the model, while transfer learning influences optimization efficiency and alignment. Using a combination of empirical training experiments and theoretical analyses, we demonstrate that pretrained models consistently leverage well-designed tokenizers more effectively, particularly at smaller vocabulary sizes. Conversely, misaligned tokenization can diminish or even invert the benefits of pretraining. These findings highlight the importance of careful tokenization in time series modeling and suggest that combining small, efficient vocabularies with pretrained weights is especially advantageous in multi-modal forecasting settings, where the overall vocabulary must be shared across modalities. Our results provide concrete guidance for designing tokenizers and leveraging transfer learning in discrete representation learning for continuous signals.

<div> Graft-versus-host disease, liver transplantation, multi-modal deep learning, electronic health records, class imbalance<br /><br />Summary:  
This study addresses the challenge of early prediction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a rare but deadly complication following liver transplantation. Using a cohort of 2,100 liver transplant patients from Mayo Clinic recorded between 1992 and 2025, which included 42 GVHD cases, the authors analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR). The dataset integrated four modalities: patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and medications. To handle heterogeneous data, irregular records, missing values, and severe class imbalance, they developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses information from all modalities and optimizes based on AUC. This approach outperformed single-modal and other multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, AUPRC of 0.157, recall of 0.768, and specificity of 0.803. The framework effectively leverages complementary information across multiple data types, improving predictive performance in the face of real-world EHR challenges. The study demonstrates that multi-modal deep learning can significantly enhance early GVHD prediction accuracy, facilitating timely clinical intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes despite the extremely imbalanced nature of the data. <div>

Abstract: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare but often fatal complication in liver transplantation, with a very high mortality rate. By harnessing multi-modal deep learning methods to integrate heterogeneous and imbalanced electronic health records (EHR), we aim to advance early prediction of GVHD, paving the way for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR) spanning the period before surgery for 2,100 liver transplantation patients, including 42 cases of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), from a cohort treated at Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2025. The dataset comprised four major modalities: patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and medications. We developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses these modalities, handles irregular records with missing values, and addresses extreme class imbalance through AUC-based optimization. The developed framework outperforms all single-modal and multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, an AUPRC of 0.157, a recall of 0.768, and a specificity of 0.803. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complementary information from different modalities, leading to improved performance. Our multi-modal deep learning framework substantially improves existing approaches for early GVHD prediction. By effectively addressing the challenges of heterogeneity and extreme class imbalance in real-world EHR, it achieves accurate early prediction. Our proposed multi-modal deep learning method demonstrates promising results for early prediction of a GVHD in liver transplantation, despite the challenge of extremely imbalanced EHR data.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, medical imaging, federated learning, adversarial attacks, brain tumor detection  

<br /><br />Summary: Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be impactful in medical imaging, notably for brain tumor detection through MRI. Despite its promise, AI models face vulnerabilities during inference when trained via Federated Learning (FL), a method aimed at ensuring patient privacy. Adversarial attacks pose a significant risk as they can subtly manipulate medical images, leading to misdiagnoses while remaining undetectable by human observers. Current defenses struggle in decentralized and varied federated medical environments. This paper introduces MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework that safeguards diagnostic AI models during inference without sacrificing privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure incorporates three main components: a personalized FL model tailored to each institution's data distribution, a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to identify suspicious inputs by revealing hidden perturbations, and an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans flagged scans. When evaluated using the Br35H brain MRI dataset, MedFedPure displayed significant improvements in adversarial robustness, with performance rising from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a clean accuracy of 97.67%. This framework offers a viable, real-time solution for implementing secure and privacy-respecting AI tools in clinical settings. <div>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great potential in medical imaging, particularly for brain tumor detection using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the models remain vulnerable at inference time when they are trained collaboratively through Federated Learning (FL), an approach adopted to protect patient privacy. Adversarial attacks can subtly alter medical scans in ways invisible to the human eye yet powerful enough to mislead AI models, potentially causing serious misdiagnoses. Existing defenses often assume centralized data and struggle to cope with the decentralized and diverse nature of federated medical settings. In this work, we present MedFedPure, a personalized federated learning defense framework designed to protect diagnostic AI models at inference time without compromising privacy or accuracy. MedFedPure combines three key elements: (1) a personalized FL model that adapts to the unique data distribution of each institution; (2) a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) that detects suspicious inputs by exposing hidden perturbations; and (3) an adaptive diffusion-based purification module that selectively cleans only the flagged scans before classification. Together, these steps offer robust protection while preserving the integrity of normal, benign images. We evaluated MedFedPure on the Br35H brain MRI dataset. The results show a significant gain in adversarial robustness, improving performance from 49.50% to 87.33% under strong attacks, while maintaining a high clean accuracy of 97.67%. By operating locally and in real time during diagnosis, our framework provides a practical path to deploying secure, trustworthy, and privacy-preserving AI tools in clinical workflows.

<div> Keywords: Full-waveform inversion, structure-aligned encoder, mixture-of-operators, velocity-field inversion, neural operators<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses challenges in full-waveform inversion (FWI), which is a method to create detailed models of subsurface structures but suffers from ill-posedness, nonlinearity, and high computational costs. <br /><br />2. Existing deep learning approaches for FWI often rely on a single convolutional neural network (CNN) or neural operator, limiting their ability to generalize across unknown or complex geological environments and to distinguish between diverse geological types. <br /><br />3. The authors propose the Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture designed specifically for velocity-field inversion without prior knowledge of subsurface structures. This approach first uses a structure-aligned encoder to transform high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, mitigating the mismatch between waveform and velocity domains and improving feature generalization and high-frequency detail recovery. <br /><br />4. An adaptive routing mechanism then dynamically selects and integrates multiple neural-operator experts—spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators—to predict velocity models more effectively than single-operator methods. <br /><br />5. Evaluation on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset demonstrates that SA-EMO substantially outperforms conventional CNN and single-operator models, achieving around 58.443% average reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) and about 10.308% better boundary resolution. Ablation studies confirm the importance of each major component: the structure-aligned encoder, expert fusion, and routing mechanism.<br /><br />6. This work establishes a new, scalable, efficient, and physically interpretable framework for full-waveform inversion, improving velocity-field prediction under complex geological conditions. <div>

Abstract: Full-waveform inversion (FWI) can produce high-resolution subsurface models, yet it remains inherently ill-posed, highly nonlinear, and computationally intensive. Although recent deep learning and numerical acceleration methods have improved speed and scalability, they often rely on single CNN architectures or single neural operators, which struggle to generalize in unknown or complex geological settings and are ineffective at distinguishing diverse geological types. To address these issues, we propose a Structure-Aligned Encoder-Mixture-of-Operators (SA-EMO) architecture for velocity-field inversion under unknown subsurface structures. First, a structure-aligned encoder maps high-dimensional seismic wavefields into a physically consistent latent space, thereby eliminating spatio-temporal mismatch between the waveform and velocity domains, recovering high-frequency components, and enhancing feature generalization. Then, an adaptive routing mechanism selects and fuses multiple neural-operator experts, including spectral, wavelet, multiscale, and local operators, to predict the velocity model. We systematically evaluate our approach on the OpenFWI benchmark and the Marmousi2 dataset. Results show that SA-EMO significantly outperforms traditional CNN or single-operator methods, achieving an average MAE reduction of approximately 58.443% and an improvement in boundary resolution of about 10.308%. Ablation studies further reveal that the structure-aligned encoder, the expert-fusion mechanism, and the routing module each contribute markedly to the performance gains. This work introduces a new paradigm for efficient, scalable, and physically interpretable full-waveform inversion.

<div> Keywords: Strain Gauge Status, time series classification, global features, hypergraph-based learning, recognition accuracy  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Strain Gauge Status (SGS) recognition is vital for intelligent manufacturing in the Internet of Things, enabling early detection of mechanical failures. Time series classification (TSC) algorithms are used to identify loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges. While deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in extracting local features from time series data, they struggle to capture essential global features, especially when local subsequences exhibit high similarity, such as in the case of aircraft wing SGS data during static strength tests. To address this limitation, the authors propose two key insights: constructing global features through feature engineering and learning high-order relationships between local features for capturing global features. To implement these insights, a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework is introduced, aimed at enhancing the representation of SGS time series and increasing recognition accuracy. The effectiveness of this method is validated on industrial SGS datasets and public UCR datasets, demonstrating improved generalization capabilities for unseen data in SGS recognition tasks. <div>

Abstract: Strain Gauge Status (SGS) recognition is crucial in the field of intelligent manufacturing based on the Internet of Things, as accurate identification helps timely detection of failed mechanical components, avoiding accidents. The loading and unloading sequences generated by strain gauges can be identified through time series classification (TSC) algorithms. Recently, deep learning models, e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in the TSC task, as they can extract discriminative local features from the subsequences to identify the time series. However, we observe that only the local features may not be sufficient for expressing the time series, especially when the local sub-sequences between different time series are very similar, e.g., SGS data of aircraft wings in static strength experiments. Nevertheless, CNNs suffer from the limitation in extracting global features due to the nature of convolution operations. For extracting global features to more comprehensively represent the SGS time series, we propose two insights: (i) Constructing global features through feature engineering. (ii) Learning high-order relationships between local features to capture global features. To realize and utilize them, we propose a hypergraph-based global feature learning and fusion framework, which learns and fuses global features for semantic consistency to enhance the representation of SGS time series, thereby improving recognition accuracy. Our method designs are validated on industrial SGS and public UCR datasets, showing better generalization for unseen data in SGS recognition.

<div> Keywords: Grain Growth, Deep Learning, LSTM, Forecasting, Microstructural Engineering

<br /><br />Summary: This study investigates the role of grain growth in materials' mechanical behavior, focusing on predicting grain size distributions. Various deep learning techniques were assessed, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, for this purpose. Instead of using computationally intensive full-field simulations, the research utilized mean-field statistical descriptors derived from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset comprising 120 grain growth sequences was created, representing normalized grain size distributions over time. The models were trained to project future distributions based on short-term historical data through a recursive forecasting method. Results indicate that the LSTM network outperformed other models, achieving over 90% accuracy and showing stable performance across long forecasting horizons. Additionally, LSTM significantly reduced computation time from roughly 20 minutes per sequence to just a few seconds. Other architectures exhibited tendencies to diverge during longer-term predictions. The findings underscore the advantages of utilizing low-dimensional descriptors alongside LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and precise microstructure predictions, with meaningful implications for digital twin development and process optimization in materials engineering. <div>

Abstract: Grain Growth strongly influences the mechanical behavior of materials, making its prediction a key objective in microstructural engineering. In this study, several deep learning approaches were evaluated, including recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional networks (TCN), and transformers, to forecast grain size distributions during grain growth. Unlike full-field simulations, which are computationally demanding, the present work relies on mean-field statistical descriptors extracted from high-fidelity simulations. A dataset of 120 grain growth sequences was processed into normalized grain size distributions as a function of time. The models were trained to predict future distributions from a short temporal history using a recursive forecasting strategy. Among the tested models, the LSTM network achieved the highest accuracy (above 90\%) and the most stable performance, maintaining physically consistent predictions over extended horizons while reducing computation time from about 20 minutes per sequence to only a few seconds, whereas the other architectures tended to diverge when forecasting further in time. These results highlight the potential of low-dimensional descriptors and LSTM-based forecasting for efficient and accurate microstructure prediction, with direct implications for digital twin development and process optimization.

<div> Keywords: few-shot learning, metric-based meta-learning, classifiers, meta-components, generalization  

<br /><br />Summary: In few-shot learning, the main challenge is to enable classifiers to generalize to unseen classes with only a few examples. A widely used approach to tackle this problem is through metric-based meta-learning. However, this method can lead to overfitting, as the deep metric learned from seen classes may not perform well on unseen classes. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel meta-learning algorithm that defines each classifier as a combination of meta-components. These meta-components are learned during meta-learning episodes focusing on seen classes. To ensure that these components do not become redundant and to promote diversity, an orthogonal regularizer is applied, which helps in capturing various shared substructures among different classifiers. The proposed method demonstrates improved generalization capabilities in extensive experiments conducted on several few-shot benchmark tasks, showing superior performance compared to existing methods. This suggests that by effectively structuring classifiers into diverse components and utilizing orthogonal regularization, the ability to learn from limited data can be significantly enhanced in the context of few-shot learning. <div>
arXiv:2511.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In few-shot learning, classifiers are expected to generalize to unseen classes given only a small number of instances of each new class. One of the popular solutions to few-shot learning is metric-based meta-learning. However, it highly depends on the deep metric learned on seen classes, which may overfit to seen classes and fail to generalize well on unseen classes. To improve the generalization, we explore the substructures of classifiers and propose a novel meta-learning algorithm to learn each classifier as a combination of meta-components. Meta-components are learned across meta-learning episodes on seen classes and disentangled by imposing an orthogonal regularizer to promote its diversity and capture various shared substructures among different classifiers. Extensive experiments on few-shot benchmark tasks show superior performances of the proposed method.

<div> Keywords: PCOS, fairness, SHAP, Random Forest, calibration  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces a new machine learning framework tailored to predict polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with a focus on fairness and interpretability. The framework employs SHAP-based feature attributions alongside demographic audits, linking predictive insights to disparities among patient subgroups. Probabilistic calibration metrics, specifically Brier Score and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), are utilized to enhance the reliability of risk predictions. Various models, including Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, were calibrated for fairness comparison, with the calibrated Random Forest achieving a predictive accuracy of 90.8%. Key influential features identified through SHAP analysis included follicle count, weight gain, and menstrual irregularity, aligning with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. Notably, the model displayed age-related performance variations, excelling with women aged 25-35 (accuracy 90.9%) but underperforming for those under 25 (69.2%). It also demonstrated perfect precision in obese women and high recall in lean PCOS cases. Finally, a Streamlit-based web interface was developed for real-time PCOS risk assessment and interactive analysis, enhancing the practical applicability of AI in clinical settings. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a fairness-audited and interpretable machine learning framework for predicting polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), designed to evaluate model performance and identify diagnostic disparities across patient subgroups. The framework integrated SHAP-based feature attributions with demographic audits to connect predictive explanations with observed disparities for actionable insights. Probabilistic calibration metrics (Brier Score and Expected Calibration Error) are incorporated to ensure reliable risk predictions across subgroups. Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost models were trained with isotonic and Platt scaling for calibration and fairness comparison. A calibrated Random Forest achieved a high predictive accuracy of 90.8%. SHAP analysis identified follicle count, weight gain, and menstrual irregularity as the most influential features, which are consistent with the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. Although the SVM with isotonic calibration achieved the lowest calibration error (ECE = 0.0541), the Random Forest model provided a better balance between calibration and interpretability (Brier = 0.0678, ECE = 0.0666). Therefore, it was selected for detailed fairness and SHAP analyses. Subgroup analysis revealed that the model performed best among women aged 25-35 (accuracy 90.9%) but underperformed in those under 25 (69.2%), highlighting age-related disparities. The model achieved perfect precision in obese women and maintained high recall in lean PCOS cases, demonstrating robustness across phenotypes. Finally, a Streamlit-based web interface enables real-time PCOS risk assessment, Rotterdam criteria evaluation, and interactive 'what-if' analysis, bridging the gap between AI research and clinical usability.

<div> Keywords: Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Regularized Long Wave equation, Adaptive loss weighting, Conservation laws, Nonlinear systems<br /><br />Summary: This research addresses the limitations of standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving the regularized long wave (RLW) equation, which exhibit large error rates. Two enhanced PINN methods were developed: an adaptive approach utilizing self-adaptive loss weighting, and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. These methods were tested on three benchmarks: single soliton propagation, interaction of two solitons, and the long-term evolution of an undular bore (up to time $t=250$). Results showed that PINN effectiveness is problem-dependent. The adaptive PINN outperformed others for problems involving complex nonlinear phenomena, such as soliton collisions. Conversely, the conservative PINN excelled in modeling long-term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. A key finding revealed that explicitly enforcing conservation laws can hinder optimization in highly nonlinear equation systems, indicating the need for special training techniques. Both adaptive and conservative PINNs achieved accuracy within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions without requiring mesh discretization, highlighting PINNs’ capability for mesh-free PDE solving. This study challenges the assumption that conservation enforcement invariably improves PINN performance and offers guidance for designing PINNs tailored to specific problem types. <div>
arXiv:2511.11638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard physics-informed neural network implementations have produced large error rates when using these models to solve the regularized long wave (RLW) equation. Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Transformer, Sparse Training, Structured Sparsity, Model Compression, Efficient Training<br /><br />Summary:  
Transformers are fundamental to modern AI but require substantial computational resources, creating system challenges. Existing sparse training techniques improve efficiency but overlook maintaining structural relationships between weight matrices, especially those interacting multiplicatively in attention and feed-forward layers, which causes performance loss at high sparsity. EcoSpa is introduced as a novel structured sparse training method that jointly evaluates and sparsifies pairs of coupled weight matrices, preserving their interaction by removing aligned rows and columns. This method defines a new granularity to measure the importance of structural components and applies coupled estimation and sparsification consistently across both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. EcoSpa’s evaluation on popular transformer architectures shows significant efficiency gains: it reduces memory usage by 50% and speeds up training by 21% on LLaMA-1B, achieves a 2.2× compression ratio with 2.4 lower perplexity on GPT-2-Medium, and provides a 1.6× speedup during inference. Importantly, the approach leverages standard PyTorch operations without needing custom hardware or specialized kernels, making efficient transformer training practical on common commodity hardware and accessible to a broader range of users. <div>

Abstract: Transformers have become the backbone of modern AI, yet their high computational demands pose critical system challenges. While sparse training offers efficiency gains, existing methods fail to preserve critical structural relationships between weight matrices that interact multiplicatively in attention and feed-forward layers. This oversight leads to performance degradation at high sparsity levels. We introduce EcoSpa, an efficient structured sparse training method that jointly evaluates and sparsifies coupled weight matrix pairs, preserving their interaction patterns through aligned row/column removal. EcoSpa introduces a new granularity for calibrating structural component importance and performs coupled estimation and sparsification across both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. Evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: EcoSpa enables efficient training of LLaMA-1B with 50\% memory reduction and 21\% faster training, achieves $2.2\times$ model compression on GPT-2-Medium with $2.4$ lower perplexity, and delivers $1.6\times$ inference speedup. The approach uses standard PyTorch operations, requiring no custom hardware or kernels, making efficient transformer training accessible on commodity hardware.

<div> Keywords: product line extension, consumer attributes, deep learning model, Conditional Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder, marketing strategy

<br /><br />Summary: This paper focuses on product line extension as a marketing strategy aimed at enhancing a company's influence while maintaining brand image. To avoid excessive line extensions, it emphasizes the importance of aligning new product offerings with consumer needs. Marketers must first understand the key attributes of their primary customers before launching new line-extended products. The study introduces a novel deep learning model called Conditional Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder (CTVAE), which predicts changes in consumer attributes using synthetic data derived from large-scale tabular datasets of consumers and products. Experimental results indicate that the CTVAE outperforms existing models in prediction accuracy. Additionally, the paper provides insights into product line marketing strategies, particularly for new products that involve changes in containers or flavors. The proposed approach aims to mitigate the risk of cannibalization and helps in designing effective product images and marketing strategies for line extensions. Overall, the findings highlight the potential for CTVAE to improve decision-making in product line marketing by leveraging advanced data analytics tailored to consumer preferences. <div>

Abstract: Product line extension is a marketing strategy that enhances a company's sphere of influence. Because excessive line extensions disrupt brand image, only appropriate line extensions based on consumer needs are desirable. Marketers should know the key consumer attributes of the primary customers for new line-extended products before companies enter the market. This paper describes a method for predicting changes in consumer attributes for new line-extended products using a novel deep learning model. The proposed model, Conditional Tabular Variational Auto-Encoder (CTVAE), generates synthetic data from large-scale tabular data of consumers and products. It can provide various implications about effective product line marketing for marketers. The experimental results demonstrate that the CTVAE offers superior prediction performance than existing models. We indicate implications for new products that change containers or flavors for effective product line marketing. The proposed approach has the potential to contribute to avoiding cannibalization and to designing product images and marketing strategies.

<div> Keywords: beam selection, transfer learning, Reinforcement Learning, energy efficiency, point cloud

<br /><br />Summary: This paper proposes a new approach for beam selection in 5G and future networks, leveraging transfer learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance sustainability. Traditional RL-based models require significant training time and computational resources, particularly in varied propagation environments, which poses challenges for scalability and energy efficiency. To mitigate this, the authors model the environment as a point cloud, representing locations of gNodeBs and surrounding scatterers. By calculating the Chamfer distance between point clouds, the method identifies structurally similar environments, allowing for the reuse of pre-trained models. This innovation results in a 16-fold reduction in training time and resource consumption, improving energy efficiency. The approach minimizes retraining in new deployments, reducing power usage and contributing to the development of sustainable AI in wireless systems. Additionally, it accelerates deployment timelines while decreasing carbon emissions linked to training processes. The simulation results validate that this approach sustains high performance and significantly lowers energy costs, highlighting the potential of transfer learning in scalable, adaptive, and environmentally friendly RL-based beam selection in diverse and dynamic propagation landscapes. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and sustainable approach for improving beam selection in 5G and beyond networks using transfer learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge. Simulation results confirm that our approach maintains high performance while drastically cutting energy costs, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to enable scalable, adaptive, and environmentally conscious RL-based beam selection strategies in dynamic and diverse propagation environments.

<div> Keywords: Time Series Foundation Models, Data Valuation, In-Context Finetuning, Temporal Dependencies, Lightweight Approach

<br /><br />Summary:  
Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have gained capabilities due to extensive pretraining with diverse data, necessitating effective data valuation for their performance. Traditional methods like influence functions suffer from computational inefficiencies and fail to maintain temporal dependencies. This paper introduces LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation method utilizing in-context finetuning. LTSV derives its theoretical foundation from the approximation of influence functions, assessing a sample's contribution by measuring changes in context loss after finetuning. It leverages the strong generalization of TSFMs for effective data valuations. To address temporal dependencies, LTSV employs a technique called temporal block aggregation, which integrates influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experimental results from various time series datasets demonstrate that LTSV consistently delivers reliable valuation performance while ensuring manageable computational costs. The findings indicate that in-context finetuning on TSFMs offers a practical solution for bridging data attribution and model generalization in time series learning, highlighting the method's versatility and robustness in evaluating time series data effectively. <div>

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated increasing capabilities due to their extensive pretraining on large volumes of diverse time series data. Consequently, the quality of time series data is crucial to TSFM performance, rendering an accurate and efficient data valuation of time series for TSFMs indispensable. However, traditional data valuation methods, such as influence functions, face severe computational bottlenecks due to their poor scalability with growing TSFM model sizes and often fail to preserve temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose LTSV, a Lightweight Time Series Valuation on TSFMS via in-context finetuning. Grounded in the theoretical evidence that in-context finetuning approximates the influence function, LTSV estimates a sample's contribution by measuring the change in context loss after in-context finetuning, leveraging the strong generalization capabilities of TSFMs to produce robust and transferable data valuations. To capture temporal dependencies, we introduce temporal block aggregation, which integrates per-block influence scores across overlapping time windows. Experiments across multiple time series datasets and models demonstrate that LTSV consistently provides reliable and strong valuation performance, while maintaining manageable computational requirements. Our results suggest that in-context finetuning on time series foundation models provides a practical and effective bridge between data attribution and model generalization in time series learning.

<div> Keywords: leak detection, water distribution networks, data-driven, Support Vector Machines, anomaly detection  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Water loss due to leaks in Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) is a significant issue, necessitating effective management and detection systems. This paper introduces a novel leak detection method focused on analyzing water pressure measurements collected from various nodes within a WDN. The technique is entirely data-driven, relying only on the WDN's topology and pressure data collected in the absence of leaks. By employing a feature extractor and a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on no-leak data, the approach identifies leaks as anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a simulated dataset from the Modena WDN. Results indicate that this solution surpasses the performance of recent leak detection methods, highlighting its potential as a reliable option for managing water resources efficiently. The study emphasizes the importance of integrating data-driven techniques in advancing leak detection systems for WDNs, ultimately contributing to reducing water loss and improving resource management. <div>

Abstract: Water is a critical resource that must be managed efficiently. However, a substantial amount of water is lost each year due to leaks in Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). This underscores the need for reliable and effective leak detection and localization systems. In recent years, various solutions have been proposed, with data-driven approaches gaining increasing attention due to their superior performance. In this paper, we propose a new method for leak detection. The method is based on water pressure measurements acquired at a series of nodes of a WDN. Our technique is a fully data-driven solution that makes only use of the knowledge of the WDN topology, and a series of pressure data acquisitions obtained in absence of leaks. The proposed solution is based on an feature extractor and a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained on no-leak data, so that leaks are detected as anomalies. The results achieved on a simulate dataset using the Modena WDN demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms recent methods for leak detection.

<div> Keywords: depression, EEG, feature selection, IDFS-MEC, noise interference  

<br /><br />Summary: The article addresses the challenges of accurately detecting depression, a critical mental health disorder, using EEG data. It highlights that EEG features often contain redundant, irrelevant, and noisy information, which complicates analysis. Real-world data acquisition can also suffer from issues like electrode detachment and heavy noise, leading to data loss. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a novel feature selection approach called Incomplete Depression Feature Selection with Missing EEG Channels (IDFS-MEC). This method incorporates missing-channel indicator information and adaptive channel weighting learning into orthogonal regression to minimize the impact of incomplete channels on model construction. Furthermore, it employs global redundancy minimization learning to eliminate redundant information among selected feature subsets. The effectiveness of IDFS-MEC is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on MODMA and PRED-d003 datasets. Results indicate that the EEG feature subsets selected using IDFS-MEC outperform ten popular feature selection methods under 3-, 64-, and 128-channel settings, thereby showcasing its potential for improving depression detection accuracy. <div>

Abstract: As a critical mental health disorder, depression has severe effects on both human physical and mental well-being. Recent developments in EEG-based depression analysis have shown promise in improving depression detection accuracies. However, EEG features often contain redundant, irrelevant, and noisy information. Additionally, real-world EEG data acquisition frequently faces challenges, such as data loss from electrode detachment and heavy noise interference. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel feature selection approach for robust depression analysis, called Incomplete Depression Feature Selection with Missing EEG Channels (IDFS-MEC). IDFS-MEC integrates missing-channel indicator information and adaptive channel weighting learning into orthogonal regression to lessen the effects of incomplete channels on model construction, and then utilizes global redundancy minimization learning to reduce redundant information among selected feature subsets. Extensive experiments conducted on MODMA and PRED-d003 datasets reveal that the EEG feature subsets chosen by IDFS-MEC have superior performance than 10 popular feature selection methods among 3-, 64-, and 128-channel settings.

<div> Keywords: Urban Weather Station Networks, WSN thinning, air temperature prediction, humidity monitoring, urban climate modeling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The study addresses the challenge of costly and labor-intensive maintenance of Urban Weather Station Networks (WSNs) used for monitoring urban weather and climate.  
2. A step-wise station removal method is applied to an existing WSN in Freiburg, Germany, to reduce the number of stations while retaining predictive capability.  
3. The ability of reduced WSN subsets to reproduce air temperature and humidity patterns of the full original network is evaluated over one year following a simulated density reduction.  
4. Results show a significant reduction in station numbers is feasible with only a modest increase in prediction errors. Specifically, reducing stations from 42 to 4 raised root-mean-square errors (RMSE) from 0.69 K to 0.83 K for temperature and from 3.8% to 4.4% for relative humidity, representing 20% and 16% increases respectively.  
5. Predictive accuracy is lower for remote forest stations compared to urban or open areas but remains better than predictions from the advanced Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme (SUEWS) numerical model.  
6. Stations positioned at the interface between built-up and rural areas provide the greatest value for city-wide climate reconstruction.  
7. The findings support the potential for optimizing WSN deployment by thinning networks to allocate financial and personnel resources more efficiently in urban climate research. <div>

Abstract: Urban weather station networks (WSNs) are widely used to monitor urban weather and climate patterns and aid urban planning. However, maintaining WSNs is expensive and labor-intensive. Here, we present a step-wise station removal procedure to thin an existing WSN in Freiburg, Germany, and analyze the ability of WSN subsets to reproduce air temperature and humidity patterns of the entire original WSN for a year following a simulated reduction of WSN density. We found that substantial reductions in station numbers after one year of full deployment are possible while retaining high predictive accuracy. A reduction from 42 to 4 stations, for instance, increased mean prediction RMSEs from 0.69 K to 0.83 K for air temperature and from 3.8% to 4.4% for relative humidity, corresponding to RMSE increases of only 20% and 16%, respectively. Predictive accuracy is worse for remote stations in forests than for stations in built-up or open settings, but consistently better than a state-of-the-art numerical urban land-surface model (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme). Stations located at the edges between built-up and rural areas are most valuable when reconstructing city-wide climate characteristics. Our study demonstrates the potential of thinning WSNs to maximize the efficient allocation of financial and personnel-related resources in urban climate research.

<div> Keywords: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Traffic Signal Control, Convergence, Stability, Stochastic Approximation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of traffic congestion caused by rapid urbanization in cities such as Bangalore, emphasizing the importance of efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems. The authors focus on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where each traffic signal operates as an independent agent using Q-learning, a method that has shown empirical success in reducing commuter delays. Despite previous empirical work, there has been a lack of rigorous theoretical analysis regarding the stability and convergence of these independent learning agents when applied to cooperative traffic control tasks. The primary goal of the study is to fill this knowledge gap by providing a formal theoretical framework. Using stochastic approximation techniques, the paper analyzes the dynamics of the MARL learning process in the context of TSC. The key contribution is a convergence proof demonstrating that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm applied to traffic signal control systems converges under prescribed conditions. This work extends previous single-agent asynchronous value iteration convergence proofs, validating the theoretical foundations of using independent learners in a cooperative multi-agent environment for traffic management. <div>

Abstract: Rapid urbanization in cities like Bangalore has led to severe traffic congestion, making efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) essential. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. This paper addresses the challenge of computing preimage bounds for neural networks, a problem known to be #P-hard, which limits scalability of existing provable methods.  
2. It proposes a novel probabilistic approach aimed at achieving high-confidence guarantees with bounded error, instead of exact, often infeasible solutions.  
3. The core contribution is the introduction of RF-ProVe (Random Forest Property Verifier), a method that leverages an ensemble of randomized decision trees to identify candidate input regions satisfying target output properties.  
4. RF-ProVe refines these candidate regions through active resampling, allowing it to better capture complex data patterns in high-dimensional input spaces where the desired output property holds.  
5. The authors provide theoretical analysis establishing formal statistical guarantees regarding the purity of the found regions as well as their global coverage, ensuring reliability of approximations.  
6. RF-ProVe offers a practical and scalable solution to preimage approximation problems, particularly useful when exact solvers are unable to scale to larger or more complex networks. <div>

Abstract: Although recent provable methods have been developed to compute preimage bounds for neural networks, their scalability is fundamentally limited by the #P-hardness of the problem. In this work, we adopt a novel probabilistic perspective, aiming to deliver solutions with high-confidence guarantees and bounded error. To this end, we investigate the potential of bootstrap-based and randomized approaches that are capable of capturing complex patterns in high-dimensional spaces, including input regions where a given output property holds. In detail, we introduce $\textbf{R}$andom $\textbf{F}$orest $\textbf{Pro}$perty $\textbf{Ve}$rifier ($\texttt{RF-ProVe}$), a method that exploits an ensemble of randomized decision trees to generate candidate input regions satisfying a desired output property and refines them through active resampling. Our theoretical derivations offer formal statistical guarantees on region purity and global coverage, providing a practical, scalable solution for computing compact preimage approximations in cases where exact solvers fail to scale.

<div> Keywords: large language models, quantization, Fourier frequency domain, activation outliers, low-frequency truncation<br /><br />Summary: This paper presents SpecQuant, a novel two-stage framework designed for extreme ultra-low-bit quantization of both activations and weights in large language models (LLMs). The approach revisits LLM compression from the perspective of the Fourier frequency domain to enhance quantization efficiency and accuracy. In the first stage, activation outliers are smoothed and integrated into the weight matrix, simplifying the process for subsequent quantization steps. The second stage involves channel-wise low-frequency Fourier truncation, which suppresses high-frequency components while retaining the essential signal energy, thereby improving the robustness of quantization. The methodology relies on the understanding that weight energy predominantly concentrates in low-frequency components, allowing these to be preserved with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, SpecQuant introduces a lightweight, adaptive truncation module that dynamically adjusts thresholds during inference based on the characteristics of each channel, enabling runtime adaptability. Experimental results on the LLaMA-3 8B model demonstrate that SpecQuant achieves 4-bit quantization for both weights and activations, reducing the zero-shot accuracy drop to only 1.5% compared to full-precision models. Furthermore, the method achieves a twofold speedup in inference and reduces memory usage by three times, highlighting its efficiency and practical benefits for deploying LLMs on end-user devices. <div>

Abstract: The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has sparked a push for advanced quantization techniques to enable efficient deployment on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the challenge of extreme LLM compression -- targeting ultra-low-bit quantization for both activations and weights -- from a Fourier frequency domain perspective. We propose SpecQuant, a two-stage framework that tackles activation outliers and cross-channel variance. In the first stage, activation outliers are smoothed and transferred into the weight matrix to simplify downstream quantization. In the second stage, we apply channel-wise low-frequency Fourier truncation to suppress high-frequency components while preserving essential signal energy, improving quantization robustness. Our method builds on the principle that most of the weight energy is concentrated in low-frequency components, which can be retained with minimal impact on model accuracy. To enable runtime adaptability, we introduce a lightweight truncation module during inference that adjusts truncation thresholds based on channel characteristics. On LLaMA-3 8B, SpecQuant achieves 4-bit quantization for both weights and activations, narrowing the zero-shot accuracy gap to only 1.5% compared to full precision, while delivering 2 times faster inference and 3times lower memory usage.

<div> Rotary Positional Embeddings, Quaternion Rotary Embeddings, Clifford Algebra, Shift-equivariance, Multivector Encoding<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitations of existing Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), particularly focusing on their extension to higher-dimensional inputs. Traditional RoPE methods are praised for their strong performance and shift-equivariance, a property often lost in non-commutative extensions such as Spherical RoPE. The authors introduce Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo), leveraging quaternions to represent 3D rotations and parameterize rotation axes, which helps overcome the ambiguities tied to rotation order inherent in spherical rotations. They demonstrate that both Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE are particular cases within the QuatRo framework. Building on this, the authors propose a further generalization named Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE), utilizing geometric algebra. CARE extends rotary embeddings beyond quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors, enabling two major advancements: rotary embeddings can now operate in arbitrary dimensions, and positional encoding is extended to multivectors with multiple grades rather than limited to vectors. Preliminary experiments compare the performance of spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based rotary embeddings, laying the groundwork for future research. This work offers a unified and extensible mathematical foundation for sophisticated positional encoding in machine learning models. <div>
arXiv:2511.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) have demonstrated exceptional performance as a positional encoding method, consistently outperforming their baselines. While recent work has sought to extend RoPE to higher-dimensional inputs, many such extensions are non-commutative, thereby forfeiting RoPE's shift-equivariance property. Spherical RoPE is one such non-commutative variant, motivated by the idea of rotating embedding vectors on spheres rather than circles. However, spherical rotations are inherently non-commutative, making the choice of rotation sequence ambiguous. In this work, we explore a quaternion-based approach -- Quaternion Rotary Embeddings (QuatRo) -- in place of Euler angles, leveraging quaternions' ability to represent 3D rotations to parameterize the axes of rotation. We show Mixed RoPE and Spherical RoPE to be special cases of QuatRo. Further, we propose a generalization of QuatRo to Clifford Algebraic Rotary Embeddings (CARE) using geometric algebra. Viewing quaternions as the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0,0), we extend the notion of rotary embeddings from quaternions to Clifford rotors acting on multivectors. This formulation enables two key generalizations: (1) extending rotary embeddings to arbitrary dimensions, and (2) encoding positional information in multivectors of multiple grades, not just vectors. We present preliminary experiments comparing spherical, quaternion, and Clifford-based rotary embeddings.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian neural networks, sampling algorithms, SA-SGLD, stepsize, curvature

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenges of scalable sampling algorithms for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), particularly focusing on stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) methods like SGLD, which are sensitive to stepsize selection. The authors introduce a novel adaptive scheme named SA-SGLD, based on the 'SamAdams' framework, which utilizes time rescaling to adjust the stepsize dynamically depending on the local gradient norm. This adaptation allows the stepsize to shrink in regions of high curvature and expand in flatter areas, thereby enhancing both the stability and mixing of the sampling process. Importantly, SA-SGLD effectively avoids the introduction of bias that is often associated with other adaptive methods requiring divergence correction terms. The proposed method demonstrates its advantages by showing improved accuracy in posterior sampling compared to traditional SGLD. The results are supported by experiments conducted on high-curvature 2D toy problems and image classification tasks utilizing BNNs with sharp priors, underscoring the effectiveness and potential of SA-SGLD in practical applications. <div>
arXiv:2511.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) require scalable sampling algorithms to approximate posterior distributions over parameters. Existing stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) methods are highly sensitive to the choice of stepsize and adaptive variants such as pSGLD typically fail to sample the correct invariant measure without addition of a costly divergence correction term. In this work, we build on the recently proposed `SamAdams' framework for timestep adaptation (Leimkuhler, Lohmann, and Whalley 2025), introducing an adaptive scheme: SA-SGLD, which employs time rescaling to modulate the stepsize according to a monitored quantity (typically the local gradient norm). SA-SGLD can automatically shrink stepsizes in regions of high curvature and expand them in flatter regions, improving both stability and mixing without introducing bias. We show that our method can achieve more accurate posterior sampling than SGLD on high-curvature 2D toy examples and in image classification with BNNs using sharp priors.

<div> Machine Unlearning, Knowledge Density, Layer Re-insertion, Large Language Models, Gradient Propagation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of machine unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs), which involves selectively removing harmful knowledge without retraining the model from scratch. Existing methods often fail to completely eliminate such knowledge, leaving residual harmful information that can be recovered. To overcome these issues, the authors propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel strategy that identifies and targets layers rich in harmful knowledge for removal. The method leverages knowledge density estimation to precisely locate these critical layers, enabling accurate and efficient unlearning. Furthermore, KUnBR introduces a layer re-insertion approach that extracts harmful knowledge-laden layers and re-inserts them into the original model architecture. This strategy bypasses gradient obstruction commonly caused by cover layers, facilitating effective gradient propagation necessary for thorough unlearning. Experimental results on various unlearning and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that KUnBR achieves state-of-the-art performance in forgetting harmful knowledge while preserving the overall utility and capabilities of the LLM. The approach thus provides a promising solution for privacy, regulatory, and ethical concerns related to managing harmful knowledge in large pre-trained models. <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning, which selectively removes harmful knowledge from a pre-trained model without retraining from scratch, is crucial for addressing privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical concerns in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing unlearning methods often struggle to thoroughly remove harmful knowledge, leaving residual harmful knowledge that can be easily recovered. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge Density-Guided Unlearning via Blocks Reinsertion (KUnBR), a novel approach that first identifies layers with rich harmful knowledge and then thoroughly eliminates the harmful knowledge via re-insertion strategy. Our method introduces knowledge density estimation to quantify and locate layers containing the most harmful knowledge, enabling precise unlearning. Additionally, we design a layer re-insertion strategy that extracts and re-inserts harmful knowledge-rich layers into the original LLM, bypassing gradient obstruction caused by cover layers and ensuring effective gradient propagation during unlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on several unlearning and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that KUnBR achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance while maintaining model utility.

<div> Keywords: Transformers, positional encoding, RollPE, traveling waves, self-attention<br /><br />Summary:  
Transformers require positional encoding to handle the permutation invariance of their self-attention mechanism. Traditional positional encodings include absolute sinusoidal embeddings or learned positional vectors, but newer approaches focus on relative positional encodings to better capture translation equivariances. This paper introduces RollPE, a novel positional encoding method inspired by traveling waves, which applies a circular roll operation to the query and key tensors within self-attention. The roll operation creates a relative phase shift between positions, enabling the model to compute attention based on positional differences instead of absolute indices. Empirical results show that RollPE significantly outperforms classic absolute positional embeddings and achieves performance comparable to Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). The authors also derive a continuous form of RollPE, which induces a topographic organization within the query and key space. Furthermore, a mathematical equivalence between RollPE and a specific configuration of RoPE is established, providing theoretical grounding. By interpreting RollPE through the concept of traveling waves, the work suggests potential simplifications of RoPE and offers insights into connections with biological processes of information flow in the brain. Overall, RollPE presents a simple yet effective alternative for positional encoding in Transformer models. <div>

Abstract: Transformers rely on positional encoding to compensate for the inherent permutation invariance of self-attention. Traditional approaches use absolute sinusoidal embeddings or learned positional vectors, while more recent methods emphasize relative encodings to better capture translation equivariances. In this work, we propose RollPE, a novel positional encoding mechanism based on traveling waves, implemented by applying a circular roll operation to the query and key tensors in self-attention. This operation induces a relative shift in phase across positions, allowing the model to compute attention as a function of positional differences rather than absolute indices. We show this simple method significantly outperforms traditional absolute positional embeddings and is comparable to RoPE. We derive a continuous case of RollPE which implicitly imposes a topographic structure on the query and key space. We further derive a mathematical equivalence of RollPE to a particular configuration of RoPE. Viewing RollPE through the lens of traveling waves may allow us to simplify RoPE and relate it to processes of information flow in the brain.

<div> Keywords: neural network, dynamic routing, adaptive computation, architecture design, interpretability<br /><br />Summary:<br /> This article introduces a novel neural network architecture that can dynamically modify its internal structure based on input data through a routing mechanism. Each layer in the model actively influences how its outputs are transmitted across the network, enabling iterative and adaptive reasoning processes inspired by human thought patterns. The architecture aims to condition information flow not merely on the input data but also on the network's evolving internal state. Crucially, the work is conceptual and does not seek to outperform current state-of-the-art language models in benchmark tasks. Instead, it serves as a prototype framework to explore networks capable of learning both representations and the computational structure itself. The study emphasizes conceptual innovation over optimization and acknowledges practical limitations in computing resources and data, which constrain the scope of experimentation. Despite these constraints, initial experimental results indicate promise, suggesting that with greater computational capacity, further experiments could unlock the architecture's full potential. Overall, the paper opens new avenues for developing adaptable, possibly more interpretable neural architectures that integrate dynamic reasoning and flexible computation paths. <div>

Abstract: This article explores the design and experimentation of a neural network architecture capable of dynamically adjusting its internal structure based on the input data. The proposed model introduces a routing mechanism that allows each layer to influence how its outputs are propagated through the network, enabling iterative and adaptive computation. This concept is loosely inspired by the idea of thought processes and dynamic reasoning, where information flow is conditioned not only on the data itself, but also on the internal state of the system.
  It is important to note that this work does not aim to compete with state-of-the-art language models in terms of performance. Instead, it presents a conceptual prototype-an architectural framework that opens up a new direction for exploring adaptable and potentially more interpretable networks. The goal is not optimization of existing benchmarks but rather the proposal of a system that can learn not only representations, but also the structure of computation itself.
  Due to practical constraints in computing resources and data, this study remains a preliminary investigation. Nevertheless, initial observations show promise, and the architecture's full potential can only be evaluated in future experiments under more favorable computational conditions.

Abstract: Learning Analytics Dashboards can be a powerful tool to support self-regulated learning in Digital Learning Environments and promote development of meta-cognitive skills, such as reflection. However, their effectiveness can be affected by the interpretability of the data they provide. To assist in the interpretation, we employ a large language model to generate verbal explanations of the data in the dashboard and evaluate it against a standalone dashboard and explanations provided by human teachers in an expert study with university level educators (N=12). We find that the LLM-based explanations of the skill state presented in the dashboard, as well as general recommendations on how to proceed with learning within the course are significantly more favored compared to the other conditions. This indicates that using LLMs for interpretation purposes can enhance the learning experience for learners while maintaining the pedagogical standards approved by teachers.

<div> Keywords: Synergistic Fusion Layer, deep learning, lyrical content classification, Sentence-BERT, Expected Calibration Error  

<br /><br />Summary: This study presents a solution to the challenge of combining high-dimensional deep semantic features with simple, interpretable structural cues for classifying lyrical content. The authors introduce the Synergistic Fusion Layer (SFL), a deep learning model that employs a gated mechanism to adjust Sentence-BERT embeddings (Fdeep) using low-dimensional auxiliary features (Fstruct). The task is redefined as binary classification to differentiate a dominant, homogeneous cluster (Class 0) from all other content (Class 1), based on clustering UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL model achieved impressive performance with an accuracy of 0.9894 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9894, surpassing a Random Forest (RF) baseline that used feature concatenation, which achieved an accuracy of 0.9868. Additionally, the SFL model displayed significantly enhanced reliability, demonstrating a 93% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0035) and a 2.5 times lower Log Loss (0.0304) compared to the RF baseline (ECE = 0.0500; Log Loss = 0.0772). This validates the hypothesis that non-linear gating is superior to simple concatenation, establishing the SFL as a trustworthy and robust system for complex multimodal lyrical analysis. <div>

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of integrating complex, high-dimensional deep semantic features with simple, interpretable structural cues for lyrical content classification. We introduce a novel Synergistic Fusion Layer (SFL) architecture, a deep learning model utilizing a gated mechanism to modulate Sentence-BERT embeddings (Fdeep) using low-dimensional auxiliary features (Fstruct). The task, derived from clustering UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings, is reframed as binary classification, distinguishing a dominant, homogeneous cluster (Class 0) from all other content (Class 1). The SFL model achieved an accuracy of 0.9894 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9894, outperforming a comprehensive Random Forest (RF) baseline that used feature concatenation (Accuracy = 0.9868). Crucially, the SFL model demonstrated vastly superior reliability and calibration, exhibiting a 93% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0035) and a 2.5x lower Log Loss (0.0304) compared to the RF baseline (ECE = 0.0500; Log Loss = 0.0772). This performance validates the architectural hypothesis that non-linear gating is superior to simple feature concatenation, establishing the SFL model as a robust and trustworthy system for complex multimodal lyrical analysis.

<title>Beyond One-Way Pruning: Bidirectional Pruning-Regrowth for Extreme Accuracy-Sparsity Tradeoff</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11675</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11675</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: model pruning, model compression, sparsity, pruning-regrowth strategy, hardware constraints<br /><br />Summary:<br />Model pruning is a widely used technique for compressing neural networks by removing less important connections to reduce model size. However, when the level of pruning sparsity goes beyond a certain threshold, the model's performance dramatically declines, which happens with both iterative and one-shot pruning methods. This sharp drop in accuracy limits how much a model can be compressed, thereby making it difficult to meet the stringent size requirements imposed by some hardware platforms, sometimes rendering the pruned models unusable. To address this challenge, the authors propose a novel bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy. Instead of pruning from a fully dense network, their method starts with an extremely compressed model that already satisfies hardware constraints. From this starting point, the strategy selectively regrows or regenerates critical connections that were previously removed to help recover the lost accuracy. This selective regrowth effectively mitigates the steep performance degradation that occurs under very high sparsity levels, enabling higher compression ratios without sacrificing model quality. As a result, the approach provides a practical and efficient way to create sparse models suitable for deployment on resource-constrained hardware platforms while maintaining robust accuracy. <div>

Abstract: As a widely adopted model compression technique, model pruning has demonstrated strong effectiveness across various architectures. However, we observe that when sparsity exceeds a certain threshold, both iterative and one-shot pruning methods lead to a steep decline in model performance. This rapid degradation limits the achievable compression ratio and prevents models from meeting the stringent size constraints required by certain hardware platforms, rendering them inoperable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a bidirectional pruning-regrowth strategy. Starting from an extremely compressed network that satisfies hardware constraints, the method selectively regenerates critical connections to recover lost performance, effectively mitigating the sharp accuracy drop commonly observed under high sparsity conditions.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Continual Multitask Learning, Geometric Structure, Catastrophic Forgetting, Robustness

<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces a new framework for Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where artificial intelligence models learn multiple tasks sequentially using a shared data stream, exemplified by applications in autonomous driving and medical imaging. Traditional continual learning methods often struggle due to the interference of fragmented, task-specific features, leading to "catastrophic forgetting" of previous tasks. The authors propose Learning with Preserving (LwP), which emphasizes maintaining the geometric structure of the representation space instead of just preserving task outputs. Central to LwP is the Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss, designed to prevent representation drift by regularizing pairwise distances between latent data representations. This approach allows the model to retain implicit knowledge across various tasks and eliminates the need for a replay buffer, making it suitable for applications that prioritize privacy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LwP mitigates catastrophic forgetting effectively and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Furthermore, it shows exceptional robustness to distribution shifts and is the only method to exceed the performance of strong single-task learning baselines, highlighting its potential for dynamic real-world environments. <div>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems in critical fields like autonomous driving and medical imaging analysis often continually learn new tasks using a shared stream of input data. For instance, after learning to detect traffic signs, a model may later need to learn to classify traffic lights or different types of vehicles using the same camera feed. This scenario introduces a challenging setting we term Continual Multitask Learning (CMTL), where a model sequentially learns new tasks on an underlying data distribution without forgetting previously learned abilities. Existing continual learning methods often fail in this setting because they learn fragmented, task-specific features that interfere with one another. To address this, we introduce Learning with Preserving (LwP), a novel framework that shifts the focus from preserving task outputs to maintaining the geometric structure of the shared representation space. The core of LwP is a Dynamically Weighted Distance Preservation (DWDP) loss that prevents representation drift by regularizing the pairwise distances between latent data representations. This mechanism of preserving the underlying geometric structure allows the model to retain implicit knowledge and support diverse tasks without requiring a replay buffer, making it suitable for privacy-conscious applications. Extensive evaluations on time-series and image benchmarks show that LwP not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CMTL tasks. Notably, our method shows superior robustness to distribution shifts and is the only approach to surpass the strong single-task learning baseline, underscoring its effectiveness for real-world dynamic environments.

<div> Keywords: Learning to optimize, AC optimal power flow, homotopy method, self-supervised learning, power system operations<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of solving AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems using learning to optimize (L2O) techniques, which aim to enable fast, reusable decision-making in real-time power system operations. <br />2. AC-OPF problems are inherently nonconvex, leading to complicated optimization landscapes where standard learning approaches often fail to find feasible and high-quality solutions.<br />3. The authors propose a homotopy-guided self-supervised L2O method that gradually deforms the objective and constraints during training, starting from a relaxed version of the problem with a wide basin of attraction and progressively shifting toward the original problem.<br />4. This homotopy-guided training approach enhances convergence stability and better enforces feasibility without relying on labeled optimal solutions or external solvers.<br />5. Evaluation on standard IEEE AC-OPF benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed method substantially improves feasibility rates compared to methods without homotopy guidance and achieves objective values close to those obtained by full AC-OPF solvers, highlighting the promise of homotopy-based heuristics for scalable, constraint-aware L2O in power system optimization. <div>

Abstract: Learning to optimize (L2O) parametric approximations of AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) solutions offers the potential for fast, reusable decision-making in real-time power system operations. However, the inherent nonconvexity of AC-OPF results in challenging optimization landscapes, and standard learning approaches often fail to converge to feasible, high-quality solutions. This work introduces a \textit{homotopy-guided self-supervised L2O method} for parametric AC-OPF problems. The key idea is to construct a continuous deformation of the objective and constraints during training, beginning from a relaxed problem with a broad basin of attraction and gradually transforming it toward the original problem. The resulting learning process improves convergence stability and promotes feasibility without requiring labeled optimal solutions or external solvers. We evaluate the proposed method on standard IEEE AC-OPF benchmarks and show that homotopy-guided L2O significantly increases feasibility rates compared to non-homotopy baselines, while achieving objective values comparable to full OPF solvers. These findings demonstrate the promise of homotopy-based heuristics for scalable, constraint-aware L2O in power system optimization.

<div> Keywords: free-boundary diffeomorphism, LSQC theory, Spectral Beltrami Network, SBN-Opt, surface mapping  

<br /><br />Summary: The paper addresses the complex problem of free-boundary diffeomorphism optimization, which is essential for accurate surface mapping but poses significant challenges due to the unconstrained boundary and the requirement for local bijectivity during large deformations. It introduces Numerical Least-Squares Quasiconformal (LSQC) theory as a solution, highlighting its benefits like provable existence, uniqueness, similarity-invariance, and resolution-independence. Traditionally, LSQC requires landmark conditioning, limiting its application in gradient-based optimization. To overcome this, the authors propose a novel neural surrogate called the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), which integrates LSQC energy into a multiscale mesh-spectral architecture. They further develop an optimization framework, SBN-Opt, that fine-tunes free-boundary diffeomorphism while allowing explicit control over local geometric distortion. Through extensive experiments focusing on density-equalizing maps and inconsistent surface registration, the study demonstrates that SBN-Opt outperforms traditional numerical algorithms, showcasing its efficacy and potential for broader applications in surface mapping problems. <div>

Abstract: Free-boundary diffeomorphism optimization is a core ingredient in the surface mapping problem but remains notoriously difficult because the boundary is unconstrained and local bijectivity must be preserved under large deformation. Numerical Least-Squares Quasiconformal (LSQC) theory, with its provable existence, uniqueness, similarity-invariance and resolution-independence, offers an elegant mathematical remedy. However, the conventional numerical algorithm requires landmark conditioning, and cannot be applied into gradient-based optimization. We propose a neural surrogate, the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), that embeds LSQC energy into a multiscale mesh-spectral architecture. Next, we propose the SBN guided optimization framework SBN-Opt which optimizes free-boundary diffeomorphism for the problem, with local geometric distortion explicitly controllable. Extensive experiments on density-equalizing maps and inconsistent surface registration demonstrate our SBN-Opt's superiority over traditional numerical algorithms.

<div> Wildfire risk, Random Forest, SHAP, California, Ecosystem drivers<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This study addresses the global threat of wildfires, focusing on California, which faces recurring fires influenced by climate, topography, vegetation, and human activities. A comprehensive wildfire risk map was developed using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm combined with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) via Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret model predictions. The model's performance was evaluated through spatial and temporal validation techniques. The RF model showed excellent predictive accuracy for grasslands (AUC 0.996) and forests (AUC 0.997). Spatial cross-validation indicated moderate model transferability with ROC-AUC scores of 0.6155 (forests) and 0.5416 (grasslands), while temporal validation demonstrated better generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC 0.6615, PR-AUC 0.8423). SHAP-based analysis identified ecosystem-specific key drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and NDVI were most influential for forests; land surface temperature, elevation, and vegetation health indices predominated for grasslands. District-level risk classification pinpointed Central Valley and Northern Buttes with the highest grassland fire risk, and Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods as primary forest high-risk zones. Overall, the RF-SHAP framework presents a robust, interpretable, and adaptable tool for wildfire risk assessment, supporting informed decision-making and targeted mitigation strategies. <div>

Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant global threat to ecosystems worldwide, with California experiencing recurring fires due to various factors, including climate, topographical features, vegetation patterns, and human activities. This study aims to develop a comprehensive wildfire risk map for California by applying the random forest (RF) algorithm, augmented with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to interpret model predictions. Model performance was assessed using both spatial and temporal validation strategies. The RF model demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving near-perfect discrimination for grasslands (AUC = 0.996) and forests (AUC = 0.997). Spatial cross-validation revealed moderate transferability, yielding ROC-AUC values of 0.6155 for forests and 0.5416 for grasslands. In contrast, temporal split validation showed enhanced generalization, especially for forests (ROC-AUC = 0.6615, PR-AUC = 0.8423). SHAP-based XAI analysis identified key ecosystem-specific drivers: soil organic carbon, tree cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) emerged as the most influential in forests, whereas Land Surface Temperature (LST), elevation, and vegetation health indices were dominant in grasslands. District-level classification revealed that Central Valley and Northern Buttes districts had the highest concentration of high-risk grasslands, while Northern Buttes and North Coast Redwoods dominated forested high-risk areas. This RF-SHAP framework offers a robust, comprehensible, and adaptable method for assessing wildfire risks, enabling informed decisions and creating targeted strategies to mitigate dangers.

<div> Keywords: cloud image segmentation, MPCM-Net, multi-scale context, feature extraction, CSRC dataset  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Ground-based cloud image segmentation is crucial for improving photovoltaic power forecasting. Current deep learning methods focus on encoder-decoder architectures but have limitations, such as reliance on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, which lacks partial feature effectiveness and inter-channel interoperability. Additionally, attention mechanisms do not adequately balance accuracy and throughput, while decoder modifications fail to capture global interdependencies among local features, hindering inference efficiency. To address these issues, the authors propose MPCM-Net, a multi-scale network that incorporates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures for better segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Key innovations include an encoder with MPAC, which features a MPC block for global spatial interaction and a MPA block for feature extraction with lower computational complexity. The decoder utilizes a M2B to reduce contextual loss via a SSHD, maintaining linear complexity while enhancing deep feature aggregation. Furthermore, the authors introduce the CSRC dataset, a fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to address the shortcomings of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments show that MPCM-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. The dataset and code are available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Ground-based cloud image segmentation is a critical research domain for photovoltaic power forecasting. Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/CSRC.

<div> Keywords: vision transformer, knowledge stratification, WPAC, PIAD, model compression  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the inefficiency of training and deploying multiple Vision Transformer (ViT) models for diverse resource constraints by proposing a single adaptable super-network. The authors present a method to transform a pre-trained ViT into a stratified knowledge-density super-network, where knowledge is hierarchically organized across weights, enabling flexible extraction of sub-networks that maximize retained knowledge at different sizes. To concentrate knowledge effectively, they introduce Weighted PCA for Attention Contraction (WPAC), which applies token-wise weighted principal component analysis on intermediate features and injects the resulting transformations into adjacent layers, preserving original network functions while compacting critical weights. Complementing this, Progressive Importance-Aware Dropout (PIAD) progressively assesses and updates the importance of weight groups during training, enforcing a dropout regime that encourages knowledge stratification throughout the network. Experimental results demonstrate that WPAC surpasses existing pruning criteria in concentrating knowledge efficiently. Furthermore, the combined approach of WPAC and PIAD establishes a strong alternative to current state-of-the-art approaches in both model compression and model expansion, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance. This work thus offers a practical and efficient framework for scalable ViT deployment across varying resource constraints. <div>

Abstract: Training and deploying multiple vision transformer (ViT) models for different resource constraints is costly and inefficient. To address this, we propose transforming a pre-trained ViT into a stratified knowledge-density super-network, where knowledge is hierarchically organized across weights. This enables flexible extraction of sub-networks that retain maximal knowledge for varying model sizes. We introduce \textbf{W}eighted \textbf{P}CA for \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{C}ontraction (WPAC), which concentrates knowledge into a compact set of critical weights. WPAC applies token-wise weighted principal component analysis to intermediate features and injects the resulting transformation and inverse matrices into adjacent layers, preserving the original network function while enhancing knowledge compactness. To further promote stratified knowledge organization, we propose \textbf{P}rogressive \textbf{I}mportance-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}ropout (PIAD). PIAD progressively evaluates the importance of weight groups, updates an importance-aware dropout list, and trains the super-network under this dropout regime to promote knowledge stratification. Experiments demonstrate that WPAC outperforms existing pruning criteria in knowledge concentration, and the combination with PIAD offers a strong alternative to state-of-the-art model compression and model expansion methods.

<div> Keywords: sequential decision, funnel structure, selective censoring, Bayesian model, healthcare disparities  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This work addresses sequential decision-making in healthcare settings characterized by funnel structures, where patients pass through progressively fewer stages with increasing decision costs, such as screening exams followed by diagnostic tests. A critical issue is that the true patient outcomes, like biopsy results, are only revealed at the funnel’s end, causing selective censoring that can bias risk estimation, particularly affecting underserved patient groups with more frequent censored outcomes. The authors develop a novel Bayesian model tailored for these funnel decision structures, building upon existing methods that handle selective labels and censoring. In synthetic experiments, the model successfully recovers true parameters and makes more accurate predictions for censored patients compared to baseline approaches. They then apply the model to emergency department data, focusing on in-hospital mortality which is only observed for admitted patients. Their analysis reveals gender-based differences in admission decisions; notably, the estimated mortality risk threshold for ICU admission is higher for women (5.1%) than for men (4.5%). This finding highlights potential biases or disparities in clinical decision-making. Overall, the study proposes a statistical framework that improves outcome prediction under censoring and uncovers important healthcare inequities. <div>

Abstract: Many sequential decision settings in healthcare feature funnel structures characterized by a series of stages, such as screenings or evaluations, where the number of patients who advance to each stage progressively decreases and decisions become increasingly costly. For example, an oncologist may first conduct a breast exam, followed by a mammogram for patients with concerning exams, followed by a biopsy for patients with concerning mammograms. A key challenge is that the ground truth outcome, such as the biopsy result, is only revealed at the end of this funnel. The selective censoring of the ground truth can introduce statistical biases in risk estimation, especially in underserved patient groups, whose outcomes are more frequently censored. We develop a Bayesian model for funnel decision structures, drawing from prior work on selective labels and censoring. We first show in synthetic settings that our model is able to recover the true parameters and predict outcomes for censored patients more accurately than baselines. We then apply our model to a dataset of emergency department visits, where in-hospital mortality is observed only for those who are admitted to either the hospital or ICU. We find that there are gender-based differences in hospital and ICU admissions. In particular, our model estimates that the mortality risk threshold to admit women to the ICU is higher for women (5.1%) than for men (4.5%).

<title>R-Tuning: Wavelet-Decomposed Replay and Semantic Alignment for Continual Adaptation of Pretrained Time-Series Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11685</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in time-series forecasting; however, adapting them to evolving data distributions remains a significant challenge. A key hurdle lies in accessing the original training data, as fine-tuning solely on new data often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose Replay Tuning (R-Tuning), a novel framework designed for the continual adaptation of pre-trained time-series models. R-Tuning constructs a unified latent space that captures both prior and current task knowledge through a frequency-aware replay strategy. Specifically, it augments model-generated samples via wavelet-based decomposition across multiple frequency bands, generating trend-preserving and fusion-enhanced variants to improve representation diversity and replay efficiency. To further reduce reliance on synthetic samples, R-Tuning introduces a latent consistency constraint that aligns new representations with the prior task space. This constraint guides joint optimization within a compact and semantically coherent latent space, ensuring robust knowledge retention and adaptation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of R-Tuning, which reduces MAE and MSE by up to 46.9% and 46.8%, respectively, on new tasks, while preserving prior knowledge with gains of up to 5.7% and 6.0% on old tasks. Notably, under few-shot settings, R-Tuning outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines even when synthetic proxy samples account for only 5% of the new task dataset.

<title>Regularized Schr\"odinger: Alleviating Distortion and Exposure Bias in Solving Inverse Problems</title>

arXiv:2511.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models serve as a powerful generative framework for solving inverse problems. However, they still face two key challenges: 1) the distortion-perception tradeoff, where improving perceptual quality often degrades reconstruction fidelity, and 2) the exposure bias problem, where the training-inference input mismatch leads to prediction error accumulation and reduced reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose the Regularized Schr\"odinger Bridge (RSB), an adaptation of Schr\"odinger Bridge tailored for inverse problems that addresses the above limitations. RSB employs a novel regularized training strategy that perturbs both the input states and targets, effectively mitigating exposure bias by exposing the model to simulated prediction errors and also alleviating distortion by well-designed interpolation via the posterior mean. Extensive experiments on two typical inverse problems for speech enhancement demonstrate that RSB outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving distortion metrics and effectively reducing exposure bias.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have set a new standard for generative fidelity but are hindered by a slow iterative sampling process. A powerful training-free strategy to accelerate this process is Schedule Optimization, which aims to find an optimal distribution of timesteps for a fixed and small Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to maximize sample quality. To this end, a successful schedule optimization method must adhere to four core principles: effectiveness, adaptivity, practical robustness, and computational efficiency. However, existing paradigms struggle to satisfy these principles simultaneously, motivating the need for a more advanced solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical-Schedule-Optimizer (HSO), a novel and efficient bi-level optimization framework. HSO reframes the search for a globally optimal schedule into a more tractable problem by iteratively alternating between two synergistic levels: an upper-level global search for an optimal initialization strategy and a lower-level local optimization for schedule refinement. This process is guided by two key innovations: the Midpoint Error Proxy (MEP), a solver-agnostic and numerically stable objective for effective local optimization, and the Spacing-Penalized Fitness (SPF) function, which ensures practical robustness by penalizing pathologically close timesteps. Extensive experiments show that HSO sets a new state-of-the-art for training-free sampling in the extremely low-NFE regime. For instance, with an NFE of just 5, HSO achieves a remarkable FID of 11.94 on LAION-Aesthetics with Stable Diffusion v2.1. Crucially, this level of performance is attained not through costly retraining, but with a one-time optimization cost of less than 8 seconds, presenting a highly practical and efficient paradigm for diffusion model acceleration.

<title>Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning for vision-language models has demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities under zero-shot settings. However, tuning the learnable prompts solely based on unlabeled test data may induce prompt optimization bias, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we analyze the underlying causes of prompt optimization bias from both the model and data perspectives. In terms of the model, the entropy minimization objective typically focuses on reducing the entropy of model predictions while overlooking their correctness. This can result in overconfident yet incorrect outputs, thereby compromising the quality of prompt optimization. On the data side, prompts affected by optimization bias can introduce misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which further aggravates the prompt optimization bias. To this end, we propose a Doubly Debiased Test-Time Prompt Tuning method. Specifically, we first introduce a dynamic retrieval-augmented modulation module that retrieves high-confidence knowledge from a dynamic knowledge base using the test image feature as a query, and uses the retrieved knowledge to modulate the predictions. Guided by the refined predictions, we further develop a reliability-aware prompt optimization module that incorporates a confidence-based weighted ensemble and cross-modal consistency distillation to impose regularization constraints during prompt tuning. Extensive experiments across 15 benchmark datasets involving both natural distribution shifts and cross-datasets generalization demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, validating its effectiveness in mitigating prompt optimization bias.

<title>Beyond saliency: enhancing explanation of speech emotion recognition with expert-referenced acoustic cues</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11691</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is critical for building transparent, trustworthy models. Current saliency-based methods, adapted from vision, highlight spectrogram regions but fail to show whether these regions correspond to meaningful acoustic markers of emotion, limiting faithfulness and interpretability. We propose a framework that overcomes these limitations by quantifying the magnitudes of cues within salient regions. This clarifies "what" is highlighted and connects it to "why" it matters, linking saliency to expert-referenced acoustic cues of speech emotions. Experiments on benchmark SER datasets show that our approach improves explanation quality by explicitly linking salient regions to theory-driven speech emotions expert-referenced acoustics. Compared to standard saliency methods, it provides more understandable and plausible explanations of SER models, offering a foundational step towards trustworthy speech-based affective computing.

<title>AnchorDS: Anchoring Dynamic Sources for Semantically Consistent Text-to-3D Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11692</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization-based text-to-3D methods distill guidance from 2D generative models via Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), but implicitly treat this guidance as static. This work shows that ignoring source dynamics yields inconsistent trajectories that suppress or merge semantic cues, leading to "semantic over-smoothing" artifacts. As such, we reformulate text-to-3D optimization as mapping a dynamically evolving source distribution to a fixed target distribution. We cast the problem into a dual-conditioned latent space, conditioned on both the text prompt and the intermediately rendered image. Given this joint setup, we observe that the image condition naturally anchors the current source distribution. Building on this insight, we introduce AnchorDS, an improved score distillation mechanism that provides state-anchored guidance with image conditions and stabilizes generation. We further penalize erroneous source estimates and design a lightweight filter strategy and fine-tuning strategy that refines the anchor with negligible overhead. AnchorDS produces finer-grained detail, more natural colours, and stronger semantic consistency, particularly for complex prompts, while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses previous methods in both quality and efficiency.

<title>Toward Dignity-Aware AI: Next-Generation Elderly Monitoring from Fall Detection to ADL</title>

Abstract: This position paper envisions a next-generation elderly monitoring system that moves beyond fall detection toward the broader goal of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition. Our ultimate aim is to design privacy-preserving, edge-deployed, and federated AI systems that can robustly detect and understand daily routines, supporting independence and dignity in aging societies. At present, ADL-specific datasets are still under collection. As a preliminary step, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments using the SISFall dataset and its GAN-augmented variants, treating fall detection as a proxy task. We report initial results on federated learning with non-IID conditions, and embedded deployment on Jetson Orin Nano devices. We then outline open challenges such as domain shift, data scarcity, and privacy risks, and propose directions toward full ADL monitoring in smart-room environments. This work highlights the transition from single-task detection to comprehensive daily activity recognition, providing both early evidence and a roadmap for sustainable and human-centered elderly care AI.

<title>Benchmarking GNNs for OOD Materials Property Prediction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11697</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MatUQ, a benchmark framework for evaluating graph neural networks (GNNs) on out-of-distribution (OOD) materials property prediction with uncertainty quantification (UQ). MatUQ comprises 1,375 OOD prediction tasks constructed from six materials datasets using five OFM-based and a newly proposed structure-aware splitting strategy, SOAP-LOCO, which captures local atomic environments more effectively. We evaluate 12 representative GNN models under a unified uncertainty-aware training protocol that combines Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Evidential Regression (DER), and introduce a novel uncertainty metric, D-EviU, which shows the strongest correlation with prediction errors in most tasks. Our experiments yield two key findings. First, the uncertainty-aware training approach significantly improves model prediction accuracy, reducing errors by an average of 70.6\% across challenging OOD scenarios. Second, the benchmark reveals that no single model dominates universally: earlier models such as SchNet and ALIGNN remain competitive, while newer models like CrystalFramer and SODNet demonstrate superior performance on specific material properties. These results provide practical insights for selecting reliable models under distribution shifts in materials discovery.

<title>Moirai 2.0: When Less Is More for Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11698</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Moirai 2.0, a decoder-only time-series foundation model trained on a new corpus of 36M series. The model adopts quantile forecasting and multi-token prediction, improving both probabilistic accuracy and inference efficiency. On the Gift-Eval benchmark, it ranks among the top pretrained models while achieving a strong trade-off between accuracy, speed, and model size. Compared to Moirai 1.0, Moirai 2.0 replaces masked-encoder training, multi-patch inputs, and mixture-distribution outputs with a simpler decoder-only architecture, single patch, and quantile loss. Ablation studies isolate these changes -- showing that the decoder-only backbone along with recursive multi-quantile decoding contribute most to the gains. Additional experiments show that Moirai 2.0 outperforms larger models from the same family and exhibits robust domain-level results. In terms of efficiency and model size, Moirai 2.0 is twice as fast and thirty times smaller than its prior best version, Moirai 1.0-Large, while also performing better. Model performance plateaus with increasing parameter count and declines at longer horizons, motivating future work on data scaling and long-horizon modeling. We release code and evaluation details to support further research.

<title>Tighter Truncated Rectangular Prism Approximation for RNN Robustness Verification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustness verification is a promising technique for rigorously proving Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) robustly. A key challenge is to over-approximate the nonlinear activation functions with linear constraints, which can transform the verification problem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem. Existing methods over-approximate the nonlinear parts with linear bounding planes individually, which may cause significant over-estimation and lead to lower verification accuracy. In this paper, in order to tightly enclose the three-dimensional nonlinear surface generated by the Hadamard product, we propose a novel truncated rectangular prism formed by two linear relaxation planes and a refinement-driven method to minimize both its volume and surface area for tighter over-approximation. Based on this approximation, we implement a prototype DeepPrism for RNN robustness verification. The experimental results demonstrate that \emph{DeepPrism} has significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in various tasks of image classification, speech recognition and sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting is critical for strategic decision-making in deregulated electricity markets, where volatility stems from complex supply-demand dynamics and external factors. Traditional point forecasts often fail to capture inherent uncertainties, limiting their utility for risk management. This work presents a framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting using Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, training separate models for each hour of the day to capture diurnal patterns. A critical assessment and comparison with the benchmark model, namely: generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity with exogenous variable (GARCHX) model and the LASSO estimated auto-regressive model (LEAR), highlights that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models in terms of point prediction and intervals. This work serves as a reference for leveraging probabilistic neural models in energy market predictions.

<title>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning in 3D Environments through Semantic Segmentation: A Case Study in ViZDoom</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in 3D environments with high-dimensional sensory input poses two major challenges: (1) the high memory consumption induced by memory buffers required to stabilise learning, and (2) the complexity of learning in partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). This project addresses these challenges by proposing two novel input representations: SS-only and RGB+SS, both employing semantic segmentation on RGB colour images. Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied. Meanwhile, RGB+SS significantly enhances RL agents' performance with the additional semantic information provided. Furthermore, we explored density-based heatmapping as a tool to visualise RL agents' movement patterns and evaluate their suitability for data collection. A brief comparison with a previous approach highlights how our method overcame common pitfalls in applying semantic segmentation in 3D environments like ViZDoom.

Abstract: We present a lightweight yet effective pipeline for training vision-language models to solve math problems by rendering LaTeX encoded equations into images and pairing them with structured chain-of-thought prompts. This simple text-to-vision augmentation enables compact multimodal architectures to achieve state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy. Through systematic ablations, we find that rendering fidelity and prompt design are the primary drivers of performance. Despite its simplicity, our approach consistently matches or surpasses both open-source and proprietary math-focused vision-language solvers on widely used benchmarks, while preserving broad general-domain competence - showing gains on tasks such as MMMU, ChartQA, and DocVQA of up to 20%.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) foundation models have emerged as an effective approach to derive latent representations of the Earth system from various remote sensing sensors. These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions.

<title>FSC-Net: Fast-Slow Consolidation Networks for Continual Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Continual learning remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting, where neural networks lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in neuroscience, we propose FSC-Net (Fast-Slow Consolidation Networks), a dual-network architecture that separates rapid task learning from gradual knowledge consolidation. Our method employs a fast network (NN1) for immediate adaptation to new tasks and a slow network (NN2) that consolidates knowledge through distillation and replay. Within the family of MLP-based NN1 variants we evaluated, consolidation effectiveness is driven more by methodology than architectural embellishments -- a simple MLP outperforms more complex similarity-gated variants by 1.2pp. Through systematic hyperparameter analysis, we observed empirically that pure replay without distillation during consolidation achieves superior performance, consistent with the hypothesis that distillation from the fast network introduces recency bias. On Split-MNIST (30 seeds), FSC-Net achieves 91.71% +/- 0.62% retention accuracy, a +4.27pp gain over the fast network alone (87.43% +/- 1.27%, paired t=23.585, p < 1e-10). On Split-CIFAR-10 (5 seeds), our method achieves 33.31% +/- 0.38% retention with an +8.20pp gain over the fast network alone (25.11% +/- 1.61%, paired t=9.75, p < 1e-3), demonstrating +8.20pp gain, though absolute performance (33.31%) remains modest and below random expectation, highlighting need for stronger backbones. Our results provide empirical evidence that the dual-timescale consolidation mechanism, rather than architectural complexity, is central to mitigating catastrophic forgetting in this setting.

Abstract: Although sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are crucial for identifying interpretable features in neural networks, it is still challenging to distinguish between real computational patterns and erroneous correlations. We introduce Model-X knockoffs to SAE feature selection, using knock-off+ to control the false discovery rate (FDR) with finite-sample guarantees under the standard Model-X assumptions (in our case, via a Gaussian surrogate for the latent distribution). We select 129 features at a target FDR q=0.1 after analyzing 512 high-activity SAE latents for sentiment classification using Pythia-70M. About 25% of the latents under examination carry task-relevant signal, whereas 75% do not, according to the chosen set, which displays a 5.40x separation in knockoff statistics compared to non-selected features. Our method offers a re-producible and principled framework for reliable feature discovery by combining SAEs with multiple-testing-aware inference, advancing the foundations of mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: What is reasoning? This question has driven centuries of philosophical inquiry, from Aristotle's syllogisms to modern computational complexity theory. In the age of large language models achieving superhuman performance on benchmarks like GSM8K (95\% accuracy) and HumanEval (90\% pass@1), we must ask: have these systems learned to \emph{reason}, or have they learned to \emph{pattern-match over reasoning traces}?
  This paper argues for a specific answer: \textbf{reasoning is iterative operator application in state spaces, converging to fixed points}. This definition is not merely philosophical -- it has concrete architectural implications that explain both the failures of current systems and the path to genuine reasoning capabilities.
  Our investigation begins with a puzzle (OpenXOR), progresses through theory (OpenOperator), and culminates in a working solution (OpenLM) that achieves 76\% accuracy where state-of-the-art LLMs achieve 0\%. This is not about criticizing existing systems, but about \emph{understanding what reasoning requires} and \emph{building architectures that provide it}.

<title>Federated Learning for Pediatric Pneumonia Detection: Enabling Collaborative Diagnosis Without Sharing Patient Data</title>

Abstract: Early and accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-rays (CXRs) is clinically critical to expedite treatment and isolation, reduce complications, and curb unnecessary antibiotic use. Although artificial intelligence (AI) substantially improves CXR-based detection, development is hindered by globally distributed data, high inter-hospital variability, and strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) that make centralization impractical. These constraints are compounded by heterogeneous imaging protocols, uneven data availability, and the costs of transferring large medical images across geographically dispersed sites.
  In this paper, we evaluate Federated Learning (FL) using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, enabling multiple hospitals (nodes) to collaboratively train a CXR classifier for pneumonia while keeping data in place and private. Using the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset, we simulate cross-hospital collaboration with non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data, reproducing real-world variability across institutions and jurisdictions. Our experiments demonstrate that collaborative and privacy-preserving training across multiple hospitals via FL led to a dramatic performance improvement achieving 0.900 Accuracy and 0.966 ROC-AUC, corresponding to 47.5% and 50.0% gains over single-hospital models (0.610; 0.644), without transferring any patient CXR. These results indicate that FL delivers high-performing, generalizable, secure and private pneumonia detection across healthcare networks, with data kept local. This is especially relevant for rare diseases, where FL enables secure multi-institutional collaboration without data movement, representing a breakthrough for accelerating diagnosis and treatment development in low-data domains.

arXiv:2511.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell data analysis seeks to characterize cellular heterogeneity based on high-dimensional gene expression profiles. Conventional approaches represent each cell as a vector in Euclidean space, which limits their ability to capture intrinsic correlations and multiscale geometric structures. We propose a multiscale framework based on Grassmann manifolds that integrates machine learning with subspace geometry for single-cell data analysis. By generating embeddings under multiple representation scales, the framework combines their features from different geometric views into a unified Grassmann manifold. A power-based scale sampling function is introduced to control the selection of scales and balance in- formation across resolutions. Experiments on nine benchmark single-cell RNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively preserves meaningful structures and provides stable clustering performance, particularly for small to medium-sized datasets. These results suggest that Grassmann manifolds offer a coherent and informative foundation for analyzing single cell data.

Abstract: Reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers by enabling real-time temperature prediction is critical for sustainability and operational efficiency. Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and achieve up to 20,000x speedup (hundreds of milliseconds vs. hours). This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\%) and reduced carbon footprint.

Abstract: Many recent works utilize denoising score matching to optimize the conditional input of diffusion models. In this workshop paper, we demonstrate that such optimization breaks the equivalence between denoising score matching and exact score matching. Furthermore, we show that this bias leads to higher score norm. Additionally, we observe a similar bias when optimizing the data distribution using a pre-trained diffusion model. Finally, we discuss the wide range of works across different domains that are affected by this bias, including MAR for auto-regressive generation, PerCo for image compression, and DreamFusion for text to 3D generation.

Standard Neural ODEs and physics informed variants often require orders of magnitude more iterations, and even then may converge to suboptimal solutions that fail to preserve oscillatory frequency or amplitude. We introduce PhysicsInformed Neural ODEs with with Scale-Aware Residuals (PI-NODE-SR), a framework that combines a low-order explicit solver (Heun method) residual normalisation to balance contributions between state variables evolving on disparate timescales. This combination stabilises training under realistic iteration budgets and avoids reliance on computationally expensive implicit solvers. On the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, PI-NODE-SR learns from a single oscillation simulated with a stiff solver (Rodas5P) and extrapolates beyond 100 ms, capturing both oscillation frequency and near-correct amplitudes. Remarkably, end-to-end learning of the vector field enables PI-NODE-SR to recover morphological features such as sharp subthreshold curvature in gating variables that are typically reserved for higher-order solvers, suggesting that neural correction can offset numerical diffusion. While performance remains sensitive to initialisation, PI-NODE-SR consistently reduces long-horizon errors relative to baseline Neural-ODEs and PINNs, offering a principled route to stable and efficient learning of stiff biological dynamics.

Abstract: This paper proposes KAN/H, a variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that uses a Haar-variant basis system having both global and local bases instead of B-spline. The resulting algorithm is applied to function approximation problems and MNIST. We show that it does not require most of the problem-specific hyper-parameter tunings.

<title>DK-Root: A Joint Data-and-Knowledge-Driven Framework for Root Cause Analysis of QoE Degradations in Mobile Networks</title>

Abstract: Diagnosing the root causes of Quality of Experience (QoE) degradations in operational mobile networks is challenging due to complex cross-layer interactions among kernel performance indicators (KPIs) and the scarcity of reliable expert annotations. Although rule-based heuristics can generate labels at scale, they are noisy and coarse-grained, limiting the accuracy of purely data-driven approaches. To address this, we propose DK-Root, a joint data-and-knowledge-driven framework that unifies scalable weak supervision with precise expert guidance for robust root-cause analysis. DK-Root first pretrains an encoder via contrastive representation learning using abundant rule-based labels while explicitly denoising their noise through a supervised contrastive objective. To supply task-faithful data augmentation, we introduce a class-conditional diffusion model that generates KPIs sequences preserving root-cause semantics, and by controlling reverse diffusion steps, it produces weak and strong augmentations that improve intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the encoder and the lightweight classifier are jointly fine-tuned with scarce expert-verified labels to sharpen decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on a real-world, operator-grade dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, with DK-Root surpassing traditional ML and recent semi-supervised time-series methods. Ablations confirm the necessity of the conditional diffusion augmentation and the pretrain-finetune design, validating both representation quality and classification gains.

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices faces two critical challenges: maintaining accuracy under aggressive quantization while ensuring predictable inference latency. We present a curiosity-driven quantized Mixture-of-Experts framework that addresses both through Bayesian epistemic uncertainty-based routing across heterogeneous experts (BitNet ternary, 1-16 bit BitLinear, post-training quantization). Evaluated on audio classification benchmarks (ESC-50, Quinn, UrbanSound8K), our 4-bit quantization maintains 99.9 percent of 16-bit accuracy (0.858 vs 0.859 F1) with 4x compression and 41 percent energy savings versus 8-bit. Crucially, curiosity-driven routing reduces MoE latency variance by 82 percent (p = 0.008, Levene's test) from 230 ms to 29 ms standard deviation, enabling stable inference for battery-constrained devices. Statistical analysis confirms 4-bit/8-bit achieve practical equivalence with full precision (p > 0.05), while MoE architectures introduce 11 percent latency overhead (p < 0.001) without accuracy gains. At scale, deployment emissions dominate training by 10000x for models serving more than 1,000 inferences, making inference efficiency critical. Our information-theoretic routing demonstrates that adaptive quantization yields accurate (0.858 F1, 1.2M params), energy-efficient (3.87 F1/mJ), and predictable edge models, with simple 4-bit quantized architectures outperforming complex MoE for most deployments.

Abstract: We present a concise, self-contained derivation of diffusion-based generative models. Starting from basic properties of Gaussian distributions (densities, quadratic expectations, re-parameterisation, products, and KL divergences), we construct denoising diffusion probabilistic models from first principles. This includes the forward noising process, its closed-form marginals, the exact discrete reverse posterior, and the related variational bound. This bound simplifies to the standard noise-prediction goal used in practice. We then discuss likelihood estimation and accelerated sampling, covering DDIM, adversarially learned reverse dynamics (DDGAN), and multi-scale variants such as nested and latent diffusion, with Stable Diffusion as a canonical example. A continuous-time formulation follows, in which we derive the probability-flow ODE from the diffusion SDE via the continuity and Fokker-Planck equations, introduce flow matching, and show how rectified flows recover DDIM up to a time re-parameterisation. Finally, we treat guided diffusion, interpreting classifier guidance as a posterior score correction and classifier-free guidance as a principled interpolation between conditional and unconditional scores. Throughout, the focus is on transparent algebra, explicit intermediate steps, and consistent notation, so that readers can both follow the theory and implement the corresponding algorithms in practice.

<title>IDOL: Meeting Diverse Distribution Shifts with Prior Physics for Tropical Cyclone Multi-Task Estimation</title>

Abstract: Tropical Cyclone (TC) estimation aims to accurately estimate various TC attributes in real time. However, distribution shifts arising from the complex and dynamic nature of TC environmental fields, such as varying geographical conditions and seasonal changes, present significant challenges to reliable estimation. Most existing methods rely on multi-modal fusion for feature extraction but overlook the intrinsic distribution of feature representations, leading to poor generalization under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this, we propose an effective Identity Distribution-Oriented Physical Invariant Learning framework (IDOL), which imposes identity-oriented constraints to regulate the feature space under the guidance of prior physical knowledge, thereby dealing distribution variability with physical invariance. Specifically, the proposed IDOL employs the wind field model and dark correlation knowledge of TC to model task-shared and task-specific identity tokens. These tokens capture task dependencies and intrinsic physical invariances of TC, enabling robust estimation of TC wind speed, pressure, inner-core, and outer-core size under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and tasks demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed IDOL, verifying that imposing identity-oriented constraints based on prior physical knowledge can effectively mitigates diverse distribution shifts in TC estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/Zjut-MultimediaPlus/IDOL.

Abstract: Systematic logistics, conveyance amenities and facilities as well as warehousing information play a key role in fostering profitable development in a supply chain. The aim of transformation in industries is the improvement of the resiliency regarding the supply chain. The resiliency policies are required for companies to affect the collaboration with logistics service providers positively. The decrement of air pollutant emissions is a persistent advantage of the efficient management of logistics and transportation in supply chain. The management of shipment type is a significant factor in analyzing the sustainability of logistics and supply chain. An automatic approach to predict the shipment type, logistics delay and traffic status are required to improve the efficiency of the supply chain management. A hybrid graphsage network (H-GSN) is proposed in this paper for multi-task purpose of logistics management in a supply chain. The shipment type, shipment status, traffic status, logistics ID and logistics delay are the objectives in this article regarding three different databases including DataCo, Shipping and Smart Logistcis available on Kaggle as supply chain logistics databases. The average accuracy of 97.8% and 100% are acquired for 10 kinds of logistics ID and 3 types of traffic status prediction in Smart Logistics dataset. The average accuracy of 98.7% and 99.4% are obtained for shipment type prediction in DataCo and logistics delay in Shipping database, respectively. The evaluation metrics for different logistics scenarios confirm the efficiency of the proposed method to improve the resilience and sustainability of the supply chain.

Abstract: We introduce the Sumudu Neural Operator (SNO), a neural operator rooted in the properties of the Sumudu Transform. We leverage the relationship between the polynomial expansions of transform pairs to decompose the input space as coefficients, which are then transformed into the Sumudu Space, where the neural operator is parameterized. We evaluate the operator in ODEs (Duffing Oscillator, Lorenz System, and Driven Pendulum) and PDEs (Euler-Bernoulli Beam, Burger's Equation, Diffusion, Diffusion-Reaction, and Brusselator). SNO achieves superior performance to FNO on PDEs and demonstrates competitive accuracy with LNO on several PDE tasks, including the lowest error on the Euler-Bernoulli Beam and Diffusion Equation. Additionally, we apply zero-shot super-resolution to the PDE tasks to observe the model's capability of obtaining higher quality data from low-quality samples. These preliminary findings suggest promise for the Sumudu Transform as a neural operator design, particularly for certain classes of PDEs.

<title>Learning Fair Representations with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

Abstract: Despite recent advances in fairness-aware machine learning, predictive models often exhibit discriminatory behavior towards marginalized groups. Such unfairness might arise from biased training data, model design, or representational disparities across groups, posing significant challenges in high-stakes decision-making domains such as college admissions. While existing fair learning models aim to mitigate bias, achieving an optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy remains a challenge. Moreover, the reliance on black-box models hinders interpretability, limiting their applicability in socially sensitive domains. In this paper, we try to circumvent these issues by integrating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) within a fair adversarial learning framework. Leveraging the adversarial robustness and interpretability of KANs, our approach enables a balance between fairness and accuracy. To further facilitate this balance, we propose an adaptive penalty update mechanism that dynamically adjusts fairness constraints during the model training. We conduct numerical experiments on two real-world college admissions datasets, across three different optimization strategies. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of KANs by consistently outperforming the baseline fair learning models, and maintaining high predictive accuracy while achieving competitive fairness across sensitive attributes.

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes distributed client resources while preserving data privacy. Most existing FL approaches assume clients possess labeled data, however, in real-world scenarios, client-side labels are often unavailable. Semi-supervised Federated learning, where only the server holds labeled data, addresses this issue. However, it experiences significant performance degradation as the number of labeled data decreases. To tackle this problem, we propose \textit{CATCHFed}, which introduces client-aware adaptive thresholds considering class difficulty, hybrid thresholds to enhance pseudo-label quality, and utilizes unpseudo-labeled data for consistency regularization. Extensive experiments across various datasets and configurations demonstrate that CATCHFed effectively leverages unlabeled client data, achieving superior performance even in extremely limited-label settings.

Abstract: ReLU activations are the main bottleneck in Private Inference that is based on ResNet networks. This is because they incur significant inference latency. Reducing ReLU count is a discrete optimization problem, and there are two common ways to approach it. Most current state-of-the-art methods are based on a smooth approximation that jointly optimizes network accuracy and ReLU budget at once. However, the last hard thresholding step of the optimization usually introduces a large performance loss. We take an alternative approach that works directly in the discrete domain by leveraging Coordinate Descent as our optimization framework. In contrast to previous methods, this yields a sparse solution by design. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments, that our method is State of the Art on common benchmarks.

Abstract: Dimension theory is a branch of topology concerned with defining and analyzing dimensions of geometric and topological spaces in purely topological terms. In this work, we adapt the classical notion of topological dimension (Lebesgue covering) to binary concept classes. The topological space naturally associated with a concept class is its space of realizable distributions. The loss function and the class itself induce a simplicial structure on this space, with respect to which we define a simplicial covering dimension.
  We prove that for finite concept classes, this simplicial covering dimension exactly characterizes the list replicability number (equivalently, global stability) in PAC learning. This connection allows us to apply tools from classical dimension theory to compute the exact list replicability number of the broad family of extremal concept classes.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have recently made tremendous progress towards solving challenging AI problems, they have done so at increasingly steep computational and API costs. We propose a novel strategy where we combine multiple LLM models with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs in an agentic manner, where models and tools are run in sequence as determined by an orchestration model to minimize cost subject to a user-specified level of reliability; this constraint is formalized using conformal prediction to provide guarantees. To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability. Our approach provides a principled and practical framework for deploying LLM agents that are significantly more cost-effective while maintaining reliability.

<title>Volatility in Certainty (VC): A Metric for Detecting Adversarial Perturbations During Inference in Neural Network Classifiers</title>

Abstract: Adversarial robustness remains a critical challenge in deploying neural network classifiers, particularly in real-time systems where ground-truth labels are unavailable during inference. This paper investigates \textit{Volatility in Certainty} (VC), a recently proposed, label-free metric that quantifies irregularities in model confidence by measuring the dispersion of sorted softmax outputs. Specifically, VC is defined as the average squared log-ratio of adjacent certainty values, capturing local fluctuations in model output smoothness. We evaluate VC as a proxy for classification accuracy and as an indicator of adversarial drift. Experiments are conducted on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on MNIST, as well as a regularized VGG-like model trained on CIFAR-10. Adversarial examples are generated using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) across varying perturbation magnitudes. In addition, mixed test sets are created by gradually introducing adversarial contamination to assess VC's sensitivity under incremental distribution shifts. Our results reveal a strong negative correlation between classification accuracy and log(VC) (correlation rho < -0.90 in most cases), suggesting that VC effectively reflects performance degradation without requiring labeled data. These findings position VC as a scalable, architecture-agnostic, and real-time performance metric suitable for early-warning systems in safety-critical applications.

<title>On the Trade-Off Between Transparency and Security in Adversarial Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Transparency and security are both central to Responsible AI, but they may conflict in adversarial settings. We investigate the strategic effect of transparency for agents through the lens of transferable adversarial example attacks. In transferable adversarial example attacks, attackers maliciously perturb their inputs using surrogate models to fool a defender's target model. These models can be defended or undefended, with both players having to decide which to use. Using a large-scale empirical evaluation of nine attacks across 181 models, we find that attackers are more successful when they match the defender's decision; hence, obscurity could be beneficial to the defender. With game theory, we analyze this trade-off between transparency and security by modeling this problem as both a Nash game and a Stackelberg game, and comparing the expected outcomes. Our analysis confirms that only knowing whether a defender's model is defended or not can sometimes be enough to damage its security. This result serves as an indicator of the general trade-off between transparency and security, suggesting that transparency in AI systems can be at odds with security. Beyond adversarial machine learning, our work illustrates how game-theoretic reasoning can uncover conflicts between transparency and security.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series research facilitate the development of foundation models. While many state-of-the-art time series foundation models have been introduced, few studies examine their effectiveness in specific downstream applications in physical science. This work investigates the role of integrating domain knowledge into time series models for hydrological rainfall-runoff modeling. Using the CAMELS-US dataset, which includes rainfall and runoff data from 671 locations with six time series streams and 30 static features, we compare baseline and foundation models. Results demonstrate that models incorporating comprehensive known exogenous inputs outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, incorporating natural annual periodic time series contribute the most significant improvements.

Abstract: Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest CO$_2$ uptake (Gross Primary Production, GPP), remains a central challenge in terrestrial ecosystem research. While Eddy Covariance (EC) towers provide high-frequency estimates, their limited spatial coverage constrains large-scale assessments. Remote sensing offers a scalable alternative, yet most approaches rely on single-sensor spectral indices and statistical models that are often unable to capture the complex temporal dynamics of GPP. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) and data fusion offer new opportunities to better represent the temporal dynamics of vegetation processes, but comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art DL models for multimodal GPP prediction remain scarce. Here, we explore the performance of two representative models for predicting GPP: 1) GPT-2, a transformer architecture, and 2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a recurrent neural network, using multivariate inputs. Overall, both achieve similar accuracy. But, while LSTM performs better overall, GPT-2 excels during extreme events. Analysis of temporal context length further reveals that LSTM attains similar accuracy using substantially shorter input windows than GPT-2, highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off between the two architectures. Feature importance analysis reveals radiation as the dominant predictor, followed by Sentinel-2, MODIS land surface temperature, and Sentinel-1 contributions. Our results demonstrate how model architecture, context length, and multimodal inputs jointly determine performance in GPP prediction, guiding future developments of DL frameworks for monitoring terrestrial carbon dynamics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet still rely heavily on external supervision (e.g., curated labels). Adversarial learning, particularly through self-play, offers a promising alternative that enables models to iteratively learn from themselves - thus reducing reliance on external supervision. Dual-play extends adversarial learning by assigning specialized roles to two models and training them against each other, fostering sustained competition and mutual evolution. Despite its promise, adapting dual-play training to LLMs remains limited, largely due to their susceptibility to reward hacking and training instability. In this paper, we introduce PasoDoble, a novel LLM dual-play framework. PasoDoble adversarially trains two models initialized from the same base model: a Proposer, which generates challenging questions with ground-truth answers, and a Solver, which attempts to solve them. We enrich the Proposer with knowledge from a pre-training dataset to ensure the questions' quality and diversity. To avoid reward hacking, the Proposer is rewarded for producing only valid questions that push the Solver's limit, while the Solver is rewarded for solving them correctly, and both are updated jointly. To further enhance training stability, we introduce an optional offline paradigm that decouples Proposer and Solver updates, alternately updating each for several steps while holding the other fixed. Notably, PasoDoble operates without supervision during training. Experimental results show that PasoDoble can improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our project page is available at https://hcy123902.github.io/PasoDoble.

Abstract: Machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains, yet their lack of interpretability limits safe deployment in high-stakes settings. Counterfactual explanations are widely used to provide actionable "what-if" recourse, but they typically remain instance-specific and do not quantify which features systematically drive outcome changes within coherent regions of the feature space or across an entire dataset. We introduce FLEX (Feature importance from Layered counterfactual EXplanations), a model- and domain-agnostic framework that converts sets of counterfactuals into feature change frequency scores at local, regional, and global levels. FLEX generalises local change-frequency measures by aggregating across instances and neighbourhoods, offering interpretable rankings that reflect how often each feature must change to flip predictions. The framework is compatible with different counterfactual generation methods, allowing users to emphasise characteristics such as sparsity, feasibility, or actionability, thereby tailoring the derived feature importances to practical constraints. We evaluate FLEX on two contrasting tabular tasks: traffic accident severity prediction and loan approval, and compare FLEX to SHAP- and LIME-derived feature importance values. Results show that (i) FLEX's global rankings correlate with SHAP while surfacing additional drivers, and (ii) regional analyses reveal context-specific factors that global summaries miss. FLEX thus bridges the gap between local recourse and global attribution, supporting transparent and intervention-oriented decision-making in risk-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Text-conditioned molecular generation aims to translate natural-language descriptions into chemical structures, enabling scientists to specify functional groups, scaffolds, and physicochemical constraints without handcrafted rules. Diffusion-based models, particularly latent diffusion models (LDMs), have recently shown promise by performing stochastic search in a continuous latent space that compactly captures molecular semantics. Yet existing methods rely on one-shot conditioning, where the entire prompt is encoded once and applied throughout diffusion, making it hard to satisfy all the requirements in the prompt. We discuss three outstanding challenges of one-shot conditioning generation, including the poor interpretability of the generated components, the failure to generate all substructures, and the overambition in considering all requirements simultaneously. We then propose three principles to address those challenges, motivated by which we propose Chain-of-Generation (CoG), a training-free multi-stage latent diffusion framework. CoG decomposes each prompt into curriculum-ordered semantic segments and progressively incorporates them as intermediate goals, guiding the denoising trajectory toward molecules that satisfy increasingly rich linguistic constraints. To reinforce semantic guidance, we further introduce a post-alignment learning phase that strengthens the correspondence between textual and molecular latent spaces. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world tasks demonstrate that CoG yields higher semantic alignment, diversity, and controllability than one-shot baselines, producing molecules that more faithfully reflect complex, compositional prompts while offering transparent insight into the generation process.

Abstract: Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) trained with Bidirectional Backpropagation (B-BP) often suffers from poor robustness and high sensitivity to noise and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel gradient-free training algorithm, the Bidirectional Subspace Rotation Algorithm (B-SRA), which significantly improves the robustness and convergence behavior of BAM. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify two key principles -- orthogonal weight matrices (OWM) and gradient-pattern alignment (GPA) -- as central to enhancing the robustness of BAM. Motivated by these findings, we introduce new regularization strategies into B-BP, resulting in models with greatly improved resistance to corruption and adversarial perturbations. We further conduct an ablation study across different training strategies to determine the most robust configuration and evaluate BAM's performance under a variety of attack scenarios and memory capacities, including 50, 100, and 200 associative pairs. Among all methods, the SAME configuration, which integrates both OWM and GPA, achieves the strongest resilience. Overall, our results demonstrate that B-SRA and the proposed regularization strategies lead to substantially more robust associative memories and open new directions for building resilient neural architectures.

<title>A Systematic Study of Model Extraction Attacks on Graph Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Graph machine learning has advanced rapidly in tasks such as link prediction, anomaly detection, and node classification. As models scale up, pretrained graph models have become valuable intellectual assets because they encode extensive computation and domain expertise. Building on these advances, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) mark a major step forward by jointly pretraining graph and text encoders on massive and diverse data. This unifies structural and semantic understanding, enables zero-shot inference, and supports applications such as fraud detection and biomedical analysis. However, the high pretraining cost and broad cross-domain knowledge in GFMs also make them attractive targets for model extraction attacks (MEAs). Prior work has focused only on small graph neural networks trained on a single graph, leaving the security implications for large-scale and multimodal GFMs largely unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic study of MEAs against GFMs. We formalize a black-box threat model and define six practical attack scenarios covering domain-level and graph-specific extraction goals, architectural mismatch, limited query budgets, partial node access, and training data discrepancies. To instantiate these attacks, we introduce a lightweight extraction method that trains an attacker encoder using supervised regression of graph embeddings. Even without contrastive pretraining data, this method learns an encoder that stays aligned with the victim text encoder and preserves its zero-shot inference ability on unseen graphs. Experiments on seven datasets show that the attacker can approximate the victim model using only a tiny fraction of its original training cost, with almost no loss in accuracy. These findings reveal that GFMs greatly expand the MEA surface and highlight the need for deployment-aware security defenses in large-scale graph learning systems.

Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) remain fundamental to modern deep learning, yet their algorithmic details are rarely presented in complete, explicit \emph{batch matrix-form}. Rather, most references express gradients per sample or rely on automatic differentiation. Although automatic differentiation can achieve equally high computational efficiency, the usage of batch matrix-form makes the computational structure explicit, which is essential for transparent, systematic analysis, and optimization in settings such as sparse neural networks. This paper fills that gap by providing a mathematically rigorous and implementation-ready specification of MLPs in batch matrix-form. We derive forward and backward equations for all standard and advanced layers, including batch normalization and softmax, and validate all equations using the symbolic mathematics library SymPy. From these specifications, we construct uniform reference implementations in NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and a high-performance C++ backend optimized for sparse operations. Our main contributions are: (1) a complete derivation of batch matrix-form backpropagation for MLPs, (2) symbolic validation of all gradient equations, (3) uniform Python and C++ reference implementations grounded in a small set of matrix primitives, and (4) demonstration of how explicit formulations enable efficient sparse computation. Together, these results establish a validated, extensible foundation for understanding, teaching, and researching neural network algorithms.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are fundamental tools in graph machine learning. The performance of GNNs relies crucially on the availability of informative node features, which can be limited or absent in real-life datasets and applications. A natural remedy is to augment the node features with embeddings computed from eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix. While it is natural to default to Laplacian spectral embeddings, which capture meaningful graph connectivity information, we ask whether spectral embeddings from alternative graph matrices can also provide useful representations for learning. We introduce Interpolated Laplacian Embeddings (ILEs), which are derived from a simple yet expressive family of graph matrices. Using tools from spectral graph theory, we offer a straightforward interpretation of the structural information that ILEs capture. We demonstrate through simulations and experiments on real-world datasets that feature augmentation via ILEs can improve performance across commonly used GNN architectures. Our work offers a straightforward and practical approach that broadens the practitioner's spectral augmentation toolkit when node features are limited.

<title>A Systematic Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Detection Under Representation and Training Paradigm Shifts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods across CLIP-stratified regimes using AURC and AUGRC as primary metrics. Experiments cover two representation paradigms: CNNs trained from scratch and a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated on CIFAR-10/100, SuperCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet. Using a multiple-comparison-controlled, rank-based pipeline (Friedman test with Conover-Holm post-hoc) and Bron-Kerbosch cliques, we find that the learned feature space largely determines OOD efficacy. For both CNNs and ViTs, probabilistic scores (e.g., MSR, GEN) dominate misclassification (ID) detection. Under stronger shifts, geometry-aware scores (e.g., NNGuide, fDBD, CTM) prevail on CNNs, whereas on ViTs GradNorm and KPCA Reconstruction Error remain consistently competitive. We further show a class-count-dependent trade-off for Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD) and that a simple PCA projection improves several detectors. These results support a representation-centric view of OOD detection and provide statistically grounded guidance for method selection under distribution shift.

<title>SurvBench: A Standardised Preprocessing Pipeline for Multi-Modal Electronic Health Record Survival Analysis</title>

Abstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data present tremendous opportunities for advancing survival analysis through deep learning, yet reproducibility remains severely constrained by inconsistent preprocessing methodologies. We present SurvBench, a comprehensive, open-source preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw PhysioNet datasets into standardised, model-ready tensors for multi-modal survival analysis. SurvBench provides data loaders for three major critical care databases, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and MC-MED, supporting diverse modalities including time-series vitals, static demographics, ICD diagnosis codes, and radiology reports. The pipeline implements rigorous data quality controls, patient-level splitting to prevent data leakage, explicit missingness tracking, and standardised temporal aggregation. SurvBench handles both single-risk (e.g., in-hospital mortality) and competing-risks scenarios (e.g., multiple discharge outcomes). The outputs are compatible with pycox library packages and implementations of standard statistical and deep learning models. By providing reproducible, configuration-driven preprocessing with comprehensive documentation, SurvBench addresses the "preprocessing gap" that has hindered fair comparison of deep learning survival models, enabling researchers to focus on methodological innovation rather than data engineering.

<title>Learning the relative composition of EEG signals using pairwise relative shift pretraining</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising approach for learning electroencephalography (EEG) representations from unlabeled data, reducing the need for expensive annotations for clinical applications like sleep staging and seizure detection. While current EEG SSL methods predominantly use masked reconstruction strategies like masked autoencoders (MAE) that capture local temporal patterns, position prediction pretraining remains underexplored despite its potential to learn long-range dependencies in neural signals. We introduce PAirwise Relative Shift or PARS pretraining, a novel pretext task that predicts relative temporal shifts between randomly sampled EEG window pairs. Unlike reconstruction-based methods that focus on local pattern recovery, PARS encourages encoders to capture relative temporal composition and long-range dependencies inherent in neural signals. Through comprehensive evaluation on various EEG decoding tasks, we demonstrate that PARS-pretrained transformers consistently outperform existing pretraining strategies in label-efficient and transfer learning settings, establishing a new paradigm for self-supervised EEG representation learning.

<title>Computation-aware Energy-harvesting Federated Learning: Cyclic Scheduling with Selective Participation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful paradigm for distributed learning, but its increasing complexity leads to significant energy consumption from client-side computations for training models. In particular, the challenge is critical in energy-harvesting FL (EHFL) systems where participation availability of each device oscillates due to limited energy. To address this, we propose FedBacys, a battery-aware EHFL framework using cyclic client participation based on users' battery levels. By clustering clients and scheduling them sequentially, FedBacys minimizes redundant computations, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability. We also introduce FedBacys-Odd, a more energy-efficient variant that allows clients to participate selectively, further reducing energy costs without compromising performance. We provide a convergence analysis for our framework and demonstrate its superior energy efficiency and robustness compared to existing algorithms through numerical experiments.

<title>Quantile Q-Learning: Revisiting Offline Extreme Q-Learning with Quantile Regression</title>

arXiv:2511.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from fixed datasets without further environment interaction, making it particularly valuable in high-risk or costly domains. Extreme $Q$-Learning (XQL) is a recent offline RL method that models Bellman errors using the Extreme Value Theorem, yielding strong empirical performance. However, XQL and its stabilized variant MXQL suffer from notable limitations: both require extensive hyperparameter tuning specific to each dataset and domain, and also exhibit instability during training. To address these issues, we proposed a principled method to estimate the temperature coefficient $\beta$ via quantile regression under mild assumptions. To further improve training stability, we introduce a value regularization technique with mild generalization, inspired by recent advances in constrained value learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive or superior performance across a range of benchmark tasks, including D4RL and NeoRL2, while maintaining stable training dynamics and using a consistent set of hyperparameters across all datasets and domains.

<title>ReCast: Reliability-aware Codebook Assisted Lightweight Time Series Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for applications in various domains. Conventional methods often rely on global decomposition into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which become ineffective for real-world series dominated by local, complex, and highly dynamic patterns. Moreover, the high model complexity of such approaches limits their applicability in real-time or resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a novel \textbf{RE}liability-aware \textbf{C}odebook-\textbf{AS}sisted \textbf{T}ime series forecasting framework (\textbf{ReCast}) that enables lightweight and robust prediction by exploiting recurring local shapes. ReCast encodes local patterns into discrete embeddings through patch-wise quantization using a learnable codebook, thereby compactly capturing stable regular structures. To compensate for residual variations not preserved by quantization, ReCast employs a dual-path architecture comprising a quantization path for efficient modeling of regular structures and a residual path for reconstructing irregular fluctuations. A central contribution of ReCast is a reliability-aware codebook update strategy, which incrementally refines the codebook via weighted corrections. These correction weights are derived by fusing multiple reliability factors from complementary perspectives by a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) scheme, ensuring adaptability to non-stationarity and robustness to distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCast outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to distribution shifts.

<title>Selecting Fine-Tuning Examples by Quizzing VLMs</title>

Abstract: A challenge in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models for specific topics is to select good examples. Fine-tuning from image sets of varying quality, such as Wikipedia Commons, will often produce poor output. However, training images that \textit{do} exemplify the target concept (e.g., a \textit{female Mountain Bluebird}) help ensure that the generated images are similarly representative (e.g., have the prototypical blue-wings and gray chest). In this work, we propose QZLoRA, a framework to select images for low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The approach leverages QuizRank, a method to automatically rank images by treating them as an `educational intervention' and `quizzing' a VLM. We demonstrate that QZLoRA can produce better aligned, photorealistic images with fewer samples. We also show that these fine-tuned models can produce stylized that are similarly representative (i.e., illustrations). Our results highlight the promise of combining automated visual reasoning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for topic-adaptive generative modeling.

<title>EARL: Entropy-Aware RL Alignment of LLMs for Reliable RTL Code Generation</title>

arXiv:2511.12033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in hardware design automation, particularly in using natural language to synthesize Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code. Despite this progress, a gap remains between model capability and the demands of real-world RTL design, including syntax errors, functional hallucinations, and weak alignment to designer intent. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising approach to bridge this gap, as hardware provides executable and formally checkable signals that can be used to further align model outputs with design intent. However, in long, structured RTL code sequences, not all tokens contribute equally to functional correctness, and na\"ively spreading gradients across all tokens dilutes learning signals. A key insight from our entropy analysis in RTL generation is that only a small fraction of tokens (e.g., always, if, assign, posedge) exhibit high uncertainty and largely influence control flow and module structure. To address these challenges, we present EARL, an Entropy-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for Verilog generation. EARL performs policy optimization using verifiable reward signals and introduces entropy-guided selective updates that gate policy gradients to high-entropy tokens. This approach preserves training stability and concentrates gradient updates on functionally important regions of code. Our experiments on VerilogEval and RTLLM show that EARL improves functional pass rates over prior LLM baselines by up to 14.7%, while reducing unnecessary updates and improving training stability. These results indicate that focusing RL on critical, high-uncertainty tokens enables more reliable and targeted policy improvement for structured RTL code generation.

<title>Mesh-based Super-resolution of Detonation Flows with Multiscale Graph Transformers</title>

Abstract: Super-resolution flow reconstruction using state-of-the-art data-driven techniques is valuable for a variety of applications, such as subgrid/subfilter closure modeling, accelerating spatiotemporal forecasting, data compression, and serving as an upscaling tool for sparse experimental measurements. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind multiscale graph transformer approach is developed for mesh-based super-resolution (SR-GT) of reacting flows. The novel data-driven modeling paradigm leverages a graph-based flow-field representation compatible with complex geometries and non-uniform/unstructured grids. Further, the transformer backbone captures long-range dependencies between different parts of the low-resolution flow-field, identifies important features, and then generates the super-resolved flow-field that preserves those features at a higher resolution. The performance of SR-GT is demonstrated in the context of spectral-element-discretized meshes for a challenging test problem of 2D detonation propagation within a premixed hydrogen-air mixture exhibiting highly complex multiscale reacting flow behavior. The SR-GT framework utilizes a unique element-local (+ neighborhood) graph representation for the coarse input, which is then tokenized before being processed by the transformer component to produce the fine output. It is demonstrated that SR-GT provides high super-resolution accuracy for reacting flow-field features and superior performance compared to traditional interpolation-based SR schemes.

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven major advances in Graph Machine Learning (GML), where graph embeddings (GEs) map features from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into vector spaces, enabling tasks like node classification and link prediction. However, since GEs are derived from explicit topology and features, they may miss crucial implicit knowledge hidden in seemingly sparse datasets, affecting graph structure and their representation. We propose a GML pipeline that integrates a Knowledge Completion (KC) phase to uncover latent dataset semantics before embedding generation. Focusing on transitive relations, we model hidden connections with decay-based inference functions, reshaping graph topology, with consequences on embedding dynamics and aggregation processes in GraphSAGE and Node2Vec. Experiments show that our GML pipeline significantly alters the embedding space geometry, demonstrating that its introduction is not just a simple enrichment but a transformative step that redefines graph representation quality.

Abstract: Adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) are sequential decision-making processes that enable personalized care by dynamically adjusting treatment decisions in response to evolving patient symptoms. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schr\"odinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions.

Abstract: Modeling indoor radio propagation is crucial for wireless network planning and optimization. However, existing approaches often rely on labor-intensive manual modeling of geometry and material properties, resulting in limited scalability and efficiency. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents SenseRay-3D, a generalizable and physics-informed end-to-end framework that predicts three-dimensional (3D) path-loss heatmaps directly from RGB-D scans, thereby eliminating the need for explicit geometry reconstruction or material annotation. The proposed framework builds a sensing-driven voxelized scene representation that jointly encodes occupancy, electromagnetic material characteristics, and transmitter-receiver geometry, which is processed by a SwinUNETR-based neural network to infer environmental path-loss relative to free-space path-loss. A comprehensive synthetic indoor propagation dataset is further developed to validate the framework and to serve as a standardized benchmark for future research. Experimental results show that SenseRay-3D achieves a mean absolute error of 4.27 dB on unseen environments and supports real-time inference at 217 ms per sample, demonstrating its scalability, efficiency, and physical consistency. SenseRay-3D paves a new path for sense-driven, generalizable, and physics-consistent modeling of indoor propagation, marking a major leap beyond our pioneering EM DeepRay framework.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning often relies on aligning representations across modalities to enable effective information integration, an approach traditionally assumed to be universally beneficial. However, prior research has primarily taken an observational approach, examining naturally occurring alignment in multimodal data and exploring its correlation with model performance, without systematically studying the direct effects of explicitly enforced alignment between representations of different modalities. In this work, we investigate how explicit alignment influences both model performance and representation alignment under different modality-specific information structures. Specifically, we introduce a controllable contrastive learning module that enables precise manipulation of alignment strength during training, allowing us to explore when explicit alignment improves or hinders performance. Our results on synthetic and real datasets under different data characteristics show that the impact of explicit alignment on the performance of unimodal models is related to the characteristics of the data: the optimal level of alignment depends on the amount of redundancy between the different modalities. We identify an optimal alignment strength that balances modality-specific signals and shared redundancy in the mixed information distributions. This work provides practical guidance on when and how explicit alignment should be applied to achieve optimal unimodal encoder performance.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of dynamic anomaly detection in accounting transactions and proposes a real-time detection method based on a Transformer to tackle the challenges of hidden abnormal behaviors and high timeliness requirements in complex trading environments. The approach first models accounting transaction data by representing multi-dimensional records as time-series matrices and uses embedding layers and positional encoding to achieve low-dimensional mapping of inputs. A sequence modeling structure with multi-head self-attention is then constructed to capture global dependencies and aggregate features from multiple perspectives, thereby enhancing the ability to detect abnormal patterns. The network further integrates feed-forward layers and regularization strategies to achieve deep feature representation and accurate anomaly probability estimation. To validate the effectiveness of the method, extensive experiments were conducted on a public dataset, including comparative analysis, hyperparameter sensitivity tests, environmental sensitivity tests, and data sensitivity tests. Results show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models in AUC, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall, and maintains stable performance under different environmental conditions and data perturbations. These findings confirm the applicability and advantages of the Transformer-based framework for dynamic anomaly detection in accounting transactions and provide methodological support for intelligent financial risk control and auditing.

Abstract: In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), efficient exploration is crucial for optimizing the performance of joint policy. However, existing methods often update joint policies via independent agent exploration, without coordination among agents, which inherently constrains the expressive capacity and exploration of joint policies. To address this issue, we propose a conductor-based joint policy framework that directly enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and coordinates exploration. In addition, we develop a Hierarchical Conductor-based Policy Optimization (HCPO) algorithm that instructs policy updates for the conductor and agents in a direction aligned with performance improvement. A rigorous theoretical guarantee further establishes the monotonicity of the joint policy optimization process. By deploying local conductors, HCPO retains centralized training benefits while eliminating inter-agent communication during execution. Finally, we evaluate HCPO on three challenging benchmarks: StarCraftII Multi-agent Challenge, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Multi-agent Particle Environment. The results indicate that HCPO outperforms competitive MARL baselines regarding cooperative efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for graph representation learning due to their effective message aggregation. However, this advantage also amplifies biases inherent in graph topology, raising fairness concerns. Existing fairness-aware GNNs provide satisfactory performance on fairness metrics such as Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity while maintaining acceptable accuracy trade-offs. Unfortunately, we observe that this pursuit of fairness metrics neglects the GNN's ability to predict negative labels, which renders their predictions with extremely high False Positive Rates (FPR), resulting in negative effects in high-risk scenarios. To this end, we advocate that classification performance should be carefully calibrated while improving fairness, rather than simply constraining accuracy loss. Furthermore, we propose Fair GNN via Structural Entropy (\textbf{FairGSE}), a novel framework that maximizes two-dimensional structural entropy (2D-SE) to improve fairness without neglecting false positives. Experiments on several real-world datasets show FairGSE reduces FPR by 39\% vs. state-of-the-art fairness-aware GNNs, with comparable fairness improvement.

Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is an advanced load monitoring technique that uses data-driven algorithms to disaggregate the total power consumption of a household into the consumption of individual appliances. However, real-world NILM deployment still faces major challenges, including overfitting, low model generalization, and disaggregating a large number of appliances operating at the same time. To address these challenges, this work proposes an end-to-end framework for the NILM classification task, which consists of high-frequency labeled data, a feature extraction method, and a lightweight neural network. Within this framework, we introduce a novel feature extraction method that fuses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) features. Moreover, we propose a lightweight architecture for multi-label NILM classification (Fusion-ResNet). The proposed feature-based model achieves a higher $F1$ score on average and across different appliances compared to state-of-the-art NILM classifiers while minimizing the training and inference time. Finally, we assessed the performance of our model against baselines with a varying number of simultaneously active devices. Results demonstrate that Fusion-ResNet is relatively robust to stress conditions with up to 15 concurrently active appliances.

Abstract: Mitigating the negative impact of noisy labels has been aperennial issue in supervised learning. Robust loss functions have emerged as a prevalent solution to this problem. In this work, we introduce the Variation Ratio as a novel property related to the robustness of loss functions, and propose a new family of robust loss functions, termed Variation-Bounded Loss (VBL), which is characterized by a bounded variation ratio. We provide theoretical analyses of the variation ratio, proving that a smaller variation ratio would lead to better robustness. Furthermore, we reveal that the variation ratio provides a feasible method to relax the symmetric condition and offers a more concise path to achieve the asymmetric condition. Based on the variation ratio, we reformulate several commonly used loss functions into a variation-bounded form for practical applications. Positive experiments on various datasets exhibit the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.

<title>Finding Time Series Anomalies using Granular-ball Vector Data Description</title>

Abstract: Modeling normal behavior in dynamic, nonlinear time series data is challenging for effective anomaly detection. Traditional methods, such as nearest neighbor and clustering approaches, often depend on rigid assumptions, such as a predefined number of reliable neighbors or clusters, which frequently break down in complex temporal scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Granular-ball One-Class Network (GBOC), a novel approach based on a data-adaptive representation called Granular-ball Vector Data Description (GVDD). GVDD partitions the latent space into compact, high-density regions represented by granular-balls, which are generated through a density-guided hierarchical splitting process and refined by removing noisy structures. Each granular-ball serves as a prototype for local normal behavior, naturally positioning itself between individual instances and clusters while preserving the local topological structure of the sample set. During training, GBOC improves the compactness of representations by aligning samples with their nearest granular-ball centers. During inference, anomaly scores are computed based on the distance to the nearest granular-ball. By focusing on dense, high-quality regions and significantly reducing the number of prototypes, GBOC delivers both robustness and efficiency in anomaly detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to handle the challenges of time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: We introduced a multimodal foundational model for financial transactions that integrates both structured attributes and unstructured textual descriptions into a unified representation. By adapting masked language modeling to transaction sequences, we demonstrated that our approach not only outperforms classical feature engineering and discrete event sequence methods but is also particularly effective in data-scarce Open Banking scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study across thousands of financial institutions in North America, providing evidence that multimodal representations can generalize across geographies and institutions. These results highlight the potential of self-supervised models to advance financial applications ranging from fraud prevention and credit risk to customer insights

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks despite extensive safety alignment. We provide a mechanistic analysis revealing that position-dependent gradient weakening during autoregressive training creates signal decay, leading to incomplete safety learning where safety training fails to transform model preferences in later response regions fully. We introduce base-favored tokens -- vocabulary elements where base models assign higher probability than aligned models -- as computational indicators of incomplete safety learning and develop a targeted completion method that addresses undertrained regions through adaptive penalties and hybrid teacher distillation. Experimental evaluation across Llama and Qwen model families demonstrates dramatic improvements in adversarial robustness, with 48--98% reductions in attack success rates while preserving general capabilities. These results establish both a mechanistic understanding and practical solutions for fundamental limitations in safety alignment methodologies.

Abstract: Many bioacoustics, neuroscience, and linguistics research utilize birdsongs as proxy models to acquire knowledge in diverse areas. Developing models generally requires precisely annotated data at the level of syllables. Hence, automated and data-efficient methods that reduce annotation costs are in demand. This work presents a lightweight, yet performant neural network architecture for birdsong annotation called Residual-MLP-RNN. Then, it presents a robust three-stage training pipeline for developing reliable deep birdsong syllable detectors with minimal expert labor. The first stage is self-supervised learning from unlabeled data. Two of the most successful pretraining paradigms are explored, namely, masked prediction and online clustering. The second stage is supervised training with effective data augmentations to create a robust model for frame-level syllable detection. The third stage is semi-supervised post-training, which leverages the unlabeled data again. However, unlike the initial phase, this time it is aligned with the downstream task. The performance of this data-efficient approach is demonstrated for the complex song of the Canary in extreme label-scarcity scenarios. Canary has one of the most difficult songs to annotate, which implicitly validates the method for other birds. Finally, the potential of self-supervised embeddings is assessed for linear probing and unsupervised birdsong analysis.

Abstract: This manuscript addresses the challenge of designing functionally graded materials (FGMs) for arbitrary-shaped domains. Towards this goal, the present work proposes a generic volume fraction profile generation algorithm based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The proposed algorithm can handle complex-shaped domains and generate smooth FGM profiles while adhering to the specified volume fraction values at boundaries/part of boundaries. The resulting design space from GPR comprises diverse profiles, enhancing the potential for discovering optimal configurations. Further, the algorithm allows the user to control the smoothness of the underlying profiles and the size of the design space through a length scale parameter. Further, the proposed profile generation scheme is coupled with the genetic algorithm to find the optimum FGM profiles for a given application. To make the genetic algorithm consistent with the GPR profile generation scheme, the standard simulated binary crossover operator in the genetic algorithm has been modified with a projection operator. We present numerous thermoelastic optimization examples to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed profile generation algorithm and optimization framework.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise in data generation, yet generating time series data remains challenging due to the need to capture complex temporal dependencies and structural patterns. In this paper, we present \textit{TSGDiff}, a novel framework that rethinks time series generation from a graph-based perspective. Specifically, we represent time series as dynamic graphs, where edges are constructed based on Fourier spectrum characteristics and temporal dependencies. A graph neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture is employed to construct a latent space, enabling the diffusion process to model the structural representation distribution of time series effectively. Furthermore, we propose the Topological Structure Fidelity (Topo-FID) score, a graph-aware metric for assessing the structural similarity of time series graph representations. Topo-FID integrates two sub-metrics: Graph Edit Similarity, which quantifies differences in adjacency matrices, and Structural Entropy Similarity, which evaluates the entropy of node degree distributions. This comprehensive metric provides a more accurate assessment of structural fidelity in generated time series. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that \textit{TSGDiff} generates high-quality synthetic time series data generation, faithfully preserving temporal dependencies and structural integrity, thereby advancing the field of synthetic time series generation.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a cornerstone of unsupervised representation learning across vision, language, and graph domains, with InfoNCE as its dominant objective. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of InfoNCE remain limited. In this work, we introduce an explicit feature space to model augmented views of samples and a transition probability matrix to capture data augmentation dynamics. We demonstrate that InfoNCE optimizes the probability of two views sharing the same source toward a constant target defined by this matrix, naturally inducing feature clustering in the representation space. Leveraging this insight, we propose Scaled Convergence InfoNCE (SC-InfoNCE), a novel loss function that introduces a tunable convergence target to flexibly control feature similarity alignment. By scaling the target matrix, SC-InfoNCE enables flexible control over feature similarity alignment, allowing the training objective to better match the statistical properties of downstream data. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including image, graph, and text tasks, show that SC-InfoNCE consistently achieves strong and reliable performance across diverse domains.

<title>Scaling Law Analysis in Federated Learning: How to Select the Optimal Model Size?</title>

Abstract: The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in training large-scale models. As the model size continues to scale, concerns are growing about the depletion of high-quality, well-curated training data. This has led practitioners to explore training approaches like Federated Learning (FL), which can leverage the abundant data on edge devices while maintaining privacy. However, the decentralization of training datasets in FL introduces challenges to scaling large models, a topic that remains under-explored. This paper fills this gap and provides qualitative insights on generalizing the previous model scaling experience to federated learning scenarios. Specifically, we derive a PAC-Bayes (Probably Approximately Correct Bayesian) upper bound for the generalization error of models trained with stochastic algorithms in federated settings and quantify the impact of distributed training data on the optimal model size by finding the analytic solution of model size that minimizes this bound. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the optimal model size has a negative power law relationship with the number of clients if the total training compute is unchanged. Besides, we also find that switching to FL with the same training compute will inevitably reduce the upper bound of generalization performance that the model can achieve through training, and that estimating the optimal model size in federated scenarios should depend on the average training compute across clients. Furthermore, we also empirically validate the correctness of our results with extensive training runs on different models, network settings, and datasets.

<title>Evaluation of Multi- and Single-objective Learning Algorithms for Imbalanced Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks aim to find models that work well not for a single, but for a group of criteria, often opposing ones. One such example is imbalanced data classification, where, on the one hand, we want to achieve the best possible classification quality for data from the minority class without degrading the classification quality of the majority class. One solution is to propose an aggregate learning criterion and reduce the multi-objective learning task to a single-criteria optimization problem. Unfortunately, such an approach is characterized by ambiguity of interpretation since the value of the aggregated criterion does not indicate the value of the component criteria. Hence, there are more and more proposals for algorithms based on multi-objective optimization (MOO), which can simultaneously optimize multiple criteria. However, such an approach results in a set of multiple non-dominated solutions (Pareto front). The selection of a single solution from the Pareto front is a challenge itself, and much attention is paid to the issue of how to select it considering user preferences, as well as how to compare solutions returned by different MOO algorithms among themselves. Thus, a significant gap has been identified in the classifier evaluation methodology, i.e., how to reliably compare methods returning single solutions with algorithms returning solutions in the form of Pareto fronts.
  To fill the aforementioned gap, this article proposes a new, reliable way of evaluating algorithms based on multi-objective algorithms with methods that return single solutions while pointing out solutions from a Pareto front tailored to the user's preferences. This work focuses only on algorithm comparison, not their learning. The algorithms selected for this study are illustrative to help understand the proposed approach.

Abstract: The surrogate gradient (SG) method has shown significant promise in enhancing the performance of deep spiking neural networks (SNNs), but it also introduces vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Although spike coding strategies and neural dynamics parameters have been extensively studied for their impact on robustness, the critical role of gradient magnitude, which reflects the model's sensitivity to input perturbations, remains underexplored. In SNNs, the gradient magnitude is primarily determined by the interaction between the membrane potential distribution (MPD) and the SG function. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MPD and SG and its implications for improving the robustness of SNNs. Our theoretical analysis reveals that reducing the proportion of membrane potential lying within the gradient-available range of the SG function effectively mitigates the sensitivity of SNNs to input perturbations. Building upon this insight, we propose a novel MPD-driven surrogate gradient regularization (MPD-SGR) method, which enhances robustness by explicitly regularizing the MPD based on its interaction with the SG function. Extensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks and diverse network architectures confirm that the MPD-SGR method significantly enhances the resilience of SNNs to adversarial perturbations and exhibits strong generalizability across diverse network configurations, SG function variants, and spike encoding schemes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that bypass safety guidelines and generate harmful content. Mitigating these vulnerabilities requires defense mechanisms that are both robust and computationally efficient. However, existing approaches either incur high computational costs or rely on lightweight defenses that can be easily circumvented, rendering them impractical for real-world LLM-based systems. In this work, we introduce the AlignTree defense, which enhances model alignment while maintaining minimal computational overhead. AlignTree monitors LLM activations during generation and detects misaligned behavior using an efficient random forest classifier. This classifier operates on two signals: (i) the refusal direction -- a linear representation that activates on misaligned prompts, and (ii) an SVM-based signal that captures non-linear features associated with harmful content. Unlike previous methods, AlignTree does not require additional prompts or auxiliary guard models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of AlignTree across multiple LLMs and benchmarks.

<title>Chicken Swarm Kernel Particle Filter: A Structured Rejuvenation Approach with KLD-Efficient Sampling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12222</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle filters (PFs) are often combined with swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), for particle rejuvenation. Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set. However, the theoretical interaction between SI-based rejuvenation kernels and KLD-based adaptive sampling is not yet fully understood.
  This paper investigates this specific interaction. We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.
  By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters.

Abstract: We present SCI, a closed-loop, control-theoretic framework that models interpretability as a regulated state. SCI formalizes the interpretive error Delta SP and actively drives SP(t) in [0, 1] ("Surgical Precision") toward a target via a projected update on the parameters Theta under a human-gain budget. The framework operates through three coordinated components: (1) reliability-weighted, multiscale features P(t, s); (2) a knowledge-guided interpreter psi_Theta that emits traceable markers and rationales; and (3) a Lyapunov-guided controller equipped with rollback, trust-region safeguards, and a descent condition. Across biomedical (EEG/ECG/ICU), industrial (bearings/tool wear), and environmental (climate/seismic) domains, SCI reduces interpretive error by 25-42% (mean 38%, 95% confidence interval 22-43%) relative to static explainers while maintaining AUC/F1 within approximately 1-2 percentage points of baseline. SCI also reduces SP variance from 0.030 to 0.011, indicating substantially more stable explanations. Modeling interpretability as a control objective yields steadier, faster-recovering, and more trustworthy interpretive behavior across diverse signal regimes.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view unsupervised feature selection (IMUFS), which aims to identify representative features from unlabeled multi-view data containing missing values, has received growing attention in recent years. Despite their promising performance, existing methods face three key challenges: 1) by focusing solely on the view-missing problem, they are not well-suited to the more prevalent mixed-missing scenario in practice, where some samples lack entire views or only partial features within views; 2) insufficient utilization of consistency and diversity across views limits the effectiveness of feature selection; and 3) the lack of theoretical analysis makes it unclear how feature selection and data imputation interact during the joint learning process. Being aware of these, we propose CLIM-FS, a novel IMUFS method designed to address the mixed-missing problem. Specifically, we integrate the imputation of both missing views and variables into a feature selection model based on nonnegative orthogonal matrix factorization, enabling the joint learning of feature selection and adaptive data imputation. Furthermore, we fully leverage consensus cluster structure and cross-view local geometrical structure to enhance the synergistic learning process. We also provide a theoretical analysis to clarify the underlying collaborative mechanism of CLIM-FS. Experimental results on eight real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that CLIM-FS outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to various adversarial perturbations. To address the safety concerns arising from these vulnerabilities, adversarial training (AT) has emerged as one of the most effective paradigms for enhancing the robustness of DNNs. However, existing AT frameworks primarily focus on a single or a limited set of attack types, leaving DNNs still exposed to attack types that may be encountered in practice but not addressed during training. In this paper, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method called Calibrated Adversarial Sampling (CAS) to address these issues. From the optimization perspective within the multi-armed bandit framework, it dynamically designs rewards and balances exploration and exploitation by considering the dynamic and interdependent characteristics of multiple robustness dimensions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CAS achieves superior overall robustness while maintaining high clean accuracy, providing a new paradigm for robust generalization of DNNs.

Abstract: Large AI models have been widely adopted in wireless communications for channel modeling, beamforming, and resource optimization. However, most existing efforts remain limited to single-modality inputs and channel-specific objec- tives, overlooking the broader potential of large foundation models for unified wireless sensing. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSense, a multi-modal, multi-task foundation model that jointly addresses channel-centric, environment-aware, and human-centered sensing. Our framework integrates image, radar, LiDAR, and textual data by transforming them into vision- compatible representations, enabling effective cross-modal align- ment within a unified feature space. A modality gating mecha- nism adaptively fuses these representations, while a vision-based large language model backbone enables unified feature align- ment and instruction-driven task adaptation. Furthermore, task- specific sequential attention and uncertainty-based loss weighting mechanisms enhance cross-task generalization. Experiments on real wireless scenario datasets show that our approach outper- forms both task-specific and large-model baselines, confirming its strong generalization across heterogeneous sensing tasks.

<title>Optimal Self-Consistency for Efficient Reasoning with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Self-consistency (SC) is a widely used test-time inference technique for improving performance in chain-of-thought reasoning. It involves generating multiple responses, or samples from a large language model (LLM) and selecting the most frequent answer. This procedure can naturally be viewed as a majority vote or empirical mode estimation. Despite its effectiveness, SC is prohibitively expensive at scale when naively applied to datasets, and it lacks a unified theoretical treatment of sample efficiency and scaling behavior. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of SC's scaling behavior and its variants, drawing on mode estimation and voting theory. We derive and empirically validate power law scaling for self-consistency across datasets, and analyze the sample efficiency for fixed-allocation and dynamic-allocation sampling schemes. From these insights, we introduce Blend-ASC, a novel variant of self-consistency that dynamically allocates samples to questions during inference, achieving state-of-the-art sample efficiency. Our approach uses 6.8x fewer samples than vanilla SC on average, outperforming both fixed- and dynamic-allocation SC baselines, thereby demonstrating the superiority of our approach in terms of efficiency. In contrast to existing variants, Blend-ASC is hyperparameter-free and can fit an arbitrary sample budget, ensuring it can be easily applied to any self-consistency application.

Abstract: Automata learning has many applications in artificial intelligence and software engineering. Central to these applications is the $L^*$ algorithm, introduced by Angluin. The $L^*$ algorithm learns deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) in polynomial time when provided with a minimally adequate teacher. Unfortunately, the $L^*$ algorithm can only learn DFAs over finite alphabets, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we extend $L^*$ to learn symbolic automata whose transitions use predicates over rational numbers, i.e., over infinite and dense alphabets. Our result makes the $L^*$ algorithm applicable to new settings like (real) RGX, and time series. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it asks a number of queries to the teacher that is at most linear with respect to the number of transitions, and to the representation size of the predicates.

<title>BlinDNO: A Distributional Neural Operator for Dynamical System Reconstruction from Time-Label-Free data</title>

Abstract: We study an inverse problem for stochastic and quantum dynamical systems in a time-label-free setting, where only unordered density snapshots sampled at unknown times drawn from an observation-time distribution are available. These observations induce a distribution over state densities, from which we seek to recover the parameters of the underlying evolution operator. We formulate this as learning a distribution-to-function neural operator and propose BlinDNO, a permutation-invariant architecture that integrates a multiscale U-Net encoder with an attention-based mixer. Numerical experiments on a wide range of stochastic and quantum systems, including a 3D protein-folding mechanism reconstruction problem in a cryo-EM setting, demonstrate that BlinDNO reliably recovers governing parameters and consistently outperforms existing neural inverse operator baselines.

Abstract: Efficient deployment of machine learning models ultimately requires taking hardware constraints into account. The binary logic gate is the fundamental building block of all digital chips. Designing models that operate directly on these units enables energy-efficient computation. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of training randomly connected networks of binary logic gates (such as OR and NAND) using gradient-based methods. We extend this approach by using gradient descent not only to select the logic gates but also to optimize their interconnections (the connectome). Optimizing the connections allows us to substantially reduce the number of logic gates required to fit a particular dataset. Our implementation is efficient both at training and inference: for instance, our LILogicNet model with only 8,000 gates can be trained on MNIST in under 5 minutes and achieves 98.45% test accuracy, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models that require at least two orders of magnitude more gates. Moreover, for our largest architecture with 256,000 gates, LILogicNet achieves 60.98% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 exceeding the performance of prior logic-gate-based models with a comparable gate budget. At inference time, the fully binarized model operates with minimal compute overhead, making it exceptionally efficient and well suited for deployment on low-power digital hardware.

<title>Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection: A VAE-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is essential for monitoring complex industrial systems, where high dimensionality, limited labeled data, and subtle dependencies between sensors cause significant challenges. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamic reward shaping, and an active learning module to address these issues in a unified learning framework. The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and selective supervision for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in real-world multivariate systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient checkpoint saving\&amp;loading has become crucial for managing storage, memory usage, and fault tolerance in LLM training. The current works do not comprehensively take into account the optimization of these several aspects. This paper proposes a novel checkpoint sparsification and quantization method that adapts dynamically to different training stages and model architectures. We present a comprehensive analysis of existing lossy and lossless compression techniques, identify current limitations, and introduce our adaptive approach that balances compression ratio, speed, and precision impact throughout the training process. Experiments on different sizes of LLMs demonstrate that our bitmask-based sparsification method achieves 16x compression ratio without compromising model accuracy. Additionally, the cluster-based quantization method achieves 2x compression ratio with little precision loss.

Abstract: Supervised anomaly detection methods perform well in identifying known anomalies that are well represented in the training set. However, they often struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution due to decision boundaries that lack a clear definition of normality. Existing approaches typically address this by regularising the representation space during training, leading to separate optimisation in latent and label spaces. The learned normality is therefore not directly utilised at inference, and their anomaly scores often fall within arbitrary ranges that require explicit mapping or calibration for probabilistic interpretation. To achieve unified learning of geometric normality and label discrimination, we propose Centre-Enhanced Discriminative Learning (CEDL), a novel supervised anomaly detection framework that embeds geometric normality directly into the discriminative objective. CEDL reparameterises the conventional sigmoid-derived prediction logit through a centre-based radial distance function, unifying geometric and discriminative learning in a single end-to-end formulation. This design enables interpretable, geometry-aware anomaly scoring without post-hoc thresholding or reference calibration. Extensive experiments on tabular, time-series, and image data demonstrate that CEDL achieves competitive and balanced performance across diverse real-world anomaly detection tasks, validating its effectiveness and broad applicability.

arXiv:2511.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely used as universal approximators for functions with inherent physical structures, including permutation symmetry. In this paper, we construct symmetric deep neural networks to approximate symmetric Korobov functions and prove that both the convergence rate and the constant prefactor scale at most polynomially with respect to the ambient dimension. This represents a substantial improvement over prior approximation guarantees that suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Building on these approximation bounds, we further derive a generalization-error rate for learning symmetric Korobov functions whose leading factors likewise avoid the curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.

<title>The 'Sure' Trap: Multi-Scale Poisoning Analysis of Stealthy Compliance-Only Backdoors in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12414</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12414</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically couple a secret trigger to an explicit malicious output. We show that this explicit association is unnecessary for common LLMs. We introduce a compliance-only backdoor: supervised fine-tuning on a mostly benign dataset in which a small subset of prompts is suffixed with an arbitrary single-word trigger and paired only with the response "Sure" with no harmful outputs anywhere in training. Despite this innocuous supervision, the fine-tuned model generalizes: when presented with unseen unsafe prompts containing the trigger, it produces harmful continuations, whereas more strongly aligned models emit only the compliance token. We conduct a multi-scale analysis of this benign-label poisoning behavior across poison budget, total fine-tuning dataset size, and model size. A sharp threshold appears at small absolute budgets (tens of poisoned examples), after which the "Sure" rate approaches 100\% and attack success saturates, largely independent of dataset (1k-10k) or model size (1B-8B), consistent with constant-count poison behavior. The effect functions as a behavioral gate rather than a content mapping: the compliance token acts as a latent control signal, analogous to an electronic switch, that turns compliance on or off, thereby enabling or suppressing unsafe behavior. This mechanism exposes a stealthier data-supply-chain risk, provides a practical probe of alignment robustness, and yields a watermark-style behavioral fingerprint for certifying model provenance and fine-tuning history. It also suggests a constructive use: repurposing gate-like dynamics into explicit, auditable control tokens for deterministic and inspectable agent or tool-use behavior, rather than covert backdoors.

Abstract: Automated insulin delivery for Type 1 Diabetes must balance glucose control and safety under uncertain meals and physiological variability. While reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive personalization, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously guarantee safety, leaving a gap in achieving both personalized and risk-aware glucose control, such as overdosing before meals or stacking corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose TSODE, a safety-aware controller that integrates Thompson Sampling RL with a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NeuralODE) forecaster to address this challenge. Specifically, the NeuralODE predicts short-term glucose trajectories conditioned on proposed insulin doses, while a conformal calibration layer quantifies predictive uncertainty to reject or scale risky actions. In the FDA-approved UVa/Padova simulator (adult cohort), TSODE achieved 87.9% time-in-range with less than 10% time below 70 mg/dL, outperforming relevant baselines. These results demonstrate that integrating adaptive RL with calibrated NeuralODE forecasting enables interpretable, safe, and robust glucose regulation.

<title>Tailored Primitive Initialization is the Secret Key to Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2511.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While RL has demonstrated substantial performance gains, it still faces key challenges, including low sampling efficiency and a strong dependence on model initialization: some models achieve rapid improvements with minimal RL steps, while others require significant training data to make progress. In this work, we investigate these challenges through the lens of reasoning token coverage and argue that initializing LLMs with diverse, high-quality reasoning primitives is essential for achieving stable and sample-efficient RL training. We propose Tailor, a finetuning pipeline that automatically discovers and curates novel reasoning primitives, thereby expanding the coverage of reasoning-state distributions before RL. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Tailor generates more diverse and higher-quality warm-start data, resulting in higher downstream RL performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown exceptional success in graph representation learning and a wide range of real-world applications. However, scaling deeper GNNs poses challenges due to the neighbor explosion problem when training on large-scale graphs. To mitigate this, a promising class of GNN training algorithms utilizes historical embeddings to reduce computation and memory costs while preserving the expressiveness of the model. These methods leverage historical embeddings for out-of-batch nodes, effectively approximating full-batch training without losing any neighbor information-a limitation found in traditional sampling methods. However, the staleness of these historical embeddings often introduces significant bias, acting as a bottleneck that can adversely affect model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel VersatIle Staleness-Aware GNN, named VISAGNN, which dynamically and adaptively incorporates staleness criteria into the large-scale GNN training process. By embedding staleness into the message passing mechanism, loss function, and historical embeddings during training, our approach enables the model to adaptively mitigate the negative effects of stale embeddings, thereby reducing estimation errors and enhancing downstream accuracy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in overcoming the staleness issue of existing historical embedding techniques, showcasing its superior performance and efficiency on large-scale benchmarks, along with significantly faster convergence.

Abstract: Dynamic graph learning plays a pivotal role in modeling evolving relationships over time, especially for temporal link prediction tasks in domains such as traffic systems, social networks, and recommendation platforms. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong performance by capturing long-range temporal dependencies, their reliance on self-attention results in quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, limiting scalability on high-frequency or large-scale graphs. In this work, we revisit the necessity of self-attention in dynamic graph modeling. Inspired by recent findings that attribute the success of Transformers more to their architectural design than attention itself, we propose GLFormer, a novel attention-free Transformer-style framework for dynamic graphs. GLFormer introduces an adaptive token mixer that performs context-aware local aggregation based on interaction order and time intervals. To capture long-term dependencies, we further design a hierarchical aggregation module that expands the temporal receptive field by stacking local token mixers across layers. Experiments on six widely-used dynamic graph benchmarks show that GLFormer achieves SOTA performance, which reveals that attention-free architectures can match or surpass Transformer baselines in dynamic graph settings with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: Depression represents a global mental health challenge requiring efficient and reliable automated detection methods. Current Transformer- or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based multimodal depression detection methods face significant challenges in modeling individual differences and cross-modal temporal dependencies across diverse behavioral contexts. Therefore, we propose P$^3$HF (Personality-guided Public-Private Domain Disentangled Hypergraph-Former Network) with three key innovations: (1) personality-guided representation learning using LLMs to transform discrete individual features into contextual descriptions for personalized encoding; (2) Hypergraph-Former architecture modeling high-order cross-modal temporal relationships; (3) event-level domain disentanglement with contrastive learning for improved generalization across behavioral contexts. Experiments on MPDD-Young dataset show P$^3$HF achieves around 10\% improvement on accuracy and weighted F1 for binary and ternary depression classification task over existing methods. Extensive ablation studies validate the independent contribution of each architectural component, confirming that personality-guided representation learning and high-order hypergraph reasoning are both essential for generating robust, individual-aware depression-related representations. The code is released at https://github.com/hacilab/P3HF.

Abstract: Multi-view multi-label data offers richer perspectives for artificial intelligence, but simultaneously presents significant challenges for feature selection due to the inherent complexity of interrelations among features, views and labels. Attention mechanisms provide an effective way for analyzing these intricate relationships. They can compute importance weights for information by aggregating correlations between Query and Key matrices to focus on pertinent values. However, existing attention-based feature selection methods predominantly focus on intra-view relationships, neglecting the complementarity of inter-view features and the critical feature-label correlations. Moreover, they often fail to account for feature redundancy, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method based on Redundancy-optimized Multi-head Attention Networks for Multi-view Multi-label Feature Selection (RMAN-MMFS). Specifically, we employ each individual attention head to model intra-view feature relationships and use the cross-attention mechanisms between different heads to capture inter-view feature complementarity. Furthermore, we design static and dynamic feature redundancy terms: the static term mitigates redundancy within each view, while the dynamic term explicitly models redundancy between unselected and selected features across the entire selection process, thereby promoting feature compactness. Comprehensive evaluations on six real-world datasets, compared against six multi-view multi-label feature selection methods, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

arXiv:2511.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies the problem of online multi-step-ahead prediction for unknown linear stochastic systems. Using conditional distribution theory, we derive an optimal parameterization of the prediction policy as a linear function of future inputs, past inputs, and past outputs. Based on this characterization, we propose an online least-squares algorithm to learn the policy and analyze its regret relative to the optimal model-based predictor. We show that the online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with respect to the optimal Kalman filter in the multi-step setting. Furthermore, with new proof techniques, we establish an almost-sure regret bound that does not rely on fixed failure probabilities for sufficiently large horizons $N$. Finally, our analysis also reveals that, while the regret remains logarithmic in $N$, its constant factor grows polynomially with the prediction horizon $H$, with the polynomial order set by the largest Jordan block of eigenvalue 1 in the system matrix.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated to be powerful priors for signal recovery, but their application to 1-bit quantization tasks, such as 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression, remains a challenge. This difficulty stems from the inherent non-linear link function in these tasks, which is either non-differentiable or lacks an explicit characterization. To tackle this issue, we introduce Diff-OneBit, which is a fast and effective DM-based approach for signal recovery under 1-bit quantization. Diff-OneBit addresses the challenge posed by non-differentiable or implicit links functions via leveraging a differentiable surrogate likelihood function to model 1-bit quantization, thereby enabling gradient based iterations. This function is integrated into a flexible plug-and-play framework that decouples the data-fidelity term from the diffusion prior, allowing any pretrained DM to act as a denoiser within the iterative reconstruction process. Extensive experiments on the FFHQ, CelebA and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that Diff-OneBit gives high-fidelity reconstructed images, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency across 1-bit compressed sensing and logistic regression tasks.

Abstract: Structure-Based drug design (SBDD) has emerged as a popular approach in drug discovery, leveraging three-dimensional protein structures to generate drug ligands. However, existing generative models encounter several key challenges: (1) incorporating boundary condition constraints, (2) integrating hierarchical structural conditions, and (3) ensuring spatial modeling fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose SculptDrug, a spatial condition-aware generative model based on Bayesian flow networks (BFNs). First, SculptDrug follows a BFN-based framework and employs a progressive denoising strategy to ensure spatial modeling fidelity, iteratively refining atom positions while enhancing local interactions for precise spatial alignment. Second, we introduce a Boundary Awareness Block that incorporates protein surface constraints into the generative process to ensure that generated ligands are geometrically compatible with the target protein. Third, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that captures global structural context while preserving fine-grained molecular interactions, ensuring overall consistency and accurate ligand-protein conformations. We evaluate SculptDrug on the CrossDocked dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that SculptDrug outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of spatial condition-aware modeling.

Abstract: Fully Test-Time Adaptation (FTTA) addresses domain shifts without access to source data and training protocols of the pre-trained models. Traditional strategies that align source and target feature distributions are infeasible in FTTA due to the absence of training data and unpredictable target domains. In this work, we exploit a dual perspective on FTTA, and propose Agnostic FTTA (AFTTA) as a novel formulation that enables the usage of off-the-shelf domain transformations during test-time to enable direct generalization to unforeseeable target data. To address this, we develop an uncover-and-unlearn approach. First, we uncover potential unwanted shifts between source and target domains by simulating them through predefined mappings and consider them as nuisances. Then, during test-time prediction, the model is enforced to unlearn these nuisances by regularizing the consequent shifts in latent representations and label predictions. Specifically, a mutual information-based criterion is devised and applied to guide nuisances unlearning in the feature space and encourage confident and consistent prediction in label space. Our proposed approach explicitly addresses agnostic domain shifts, enabling superior model generalization under FTTA constraints. Extensive experiments on various tasks, involving corruption and style shifts, demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a novel paradigm that describe the samples by label distribution of a sample. However, acquiring LDL dataset is costly and time-consuming, which leads to the birth of incomplete label distribution learning (IncomLDL). All the previous IncomLDL methods set the description degrees of "missing" labels in an instance to 0, but remains those of other labels unchanged. This setting is unrealistic because when certain labels are missing, the degrees of the remaining labels will increase accordingly. We fix this unrealistic setting in IncomLDL and raise a new problem: LDL with hidden labels (HidLDL), which aims to recover a complete label distribution from a real-world incomplete label distribution where certain labels in an instance are omitted during annotation. To solve this challenging problem, we discover the significance of proportional information of the observed labels and capture it by an innovative constraint to utilize it during the optimization process. We simultaneously use local feature similarity and the global low-rank structure to reveal the mysterious veil of hidden labels. Moreover, we theoretically give the recovery bound of our method, proving the feasibility of our method in learning from hidden labels. Extensive recovery and predictive experiments on various datasets prove the superiority of our method to state-of-the-art LDL and IncomLDL methods.

Abstract: Binary Spiking Neural Networks (BSNNs) offer promising efficiency advantages for resource-constrained computing. However, their training algorithms often require substantial memory overhead due to latent weights storage and temporal processing requirements. To address this issue, we propose Binary Spiking Online (BSO) optimization algorithm, a novel online training algorithm that significantly reduces training memory. BSO directly updates weights through flip signals under the online training framework. These signals are triggered when the product of gradient momentum and weights exceeds a threshold, eliminating the need for latent weights during training. To enhance performance, we propose T-BSO, a temporal-aware variant that leverages the inherent temporal dynamics of BSNNs by capturing gradient information across time steps for adaptive threshold adjustment. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees for both BSO and T-BSO, with formal regret bounds characterizing their convergence rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both BSO and T-BSO achieve superior optimization performance compared to existing training methods for BSNNs. The codes are available at https://github.com/hamings1/BSO.

<title>Hierarchical Frequency-Decomposition Graph Neural Networks for Road Network Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Road networks are critical infrastructures underpinning intelligent transportation systems and their related applications. Effective representation learning of road networks remains challenging due to the complex interplay between spatial structures and frequency characteristics in traffic patterns. Existing graph neural networks for modeling road networks predominantly fall into two paradigms: spatial-based methods that capture local topology but tend to over-smooth representations, and spectral-based methods that analyze global frequency components but often overlook localized variations. This spatial-spectral misalignment limits their modeling capacity for road networks exhibiting both coarse global trends and fine-grained local fluctuations. To bridge this gap, we propose HiFiNet, a novel hierarchical frequency-decomposition graph neural network that unifies spatial and spectral modeling. HiFiNet constructs a multi-level hierarchy of virtual nodes to enable localized frequency analysis, and employs a decomposition-updating-reconstruction framework with a topology-aware graph transformer to separately model and fuse low- and high-frequency signals. Theoretically justified and empirically validated on multiple real-world datasets across four downstream tasks, HiFiNet demonstrates superior performance and generalization ability in capturing effective road network representations.

<title>Spectral Bias Mitigation via xLSTM-PINN: Memory-Gated Representation Refinement for Physics-Informed Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12512</link>

Abstract: Physics-informed learning for PDEs is surging across scientific computing and industrial simulation, yet prevailing methods face spectral bias, residual-data imbalance, and weak extrapolation. We introduce a representation-level spectral remodeling xLSTM-PINN that combines gated-memory multiscale feature extraction with adaptive residual-data weighting to curb spectral bias and strengthen extrapolation. Across four benchmarks, we integrate gated cross-scale memory, a staged frequency curriculum, and adaptive residual reweighting, and verify with analytic references and extrapolation tests, achieving markedly lower spectral error and RMSE and a broader stable learning-rate window. Frequency-domain benchmarks show raised high-frequency kernel weights and a right-shifted resolvable bandwidth, shorter high-k error decay and time-to-threshold, and narrower error bands with lower MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE. Compared with the baseline PINN, we reduce MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MaxAE across all four benchmarks and deliver cleaner boundary transitions with attenuated high-frequency ripples in both frequency and field maps. This work suppresses spectral bias, widens the resolvable band and shortens the high-k time-to-threshold under the same budget, and without altering AD or physics losses improves accuracy, reproducibility, and transferability.

<title>Regret Guarantees for Linear Contextual Stochastic Shortest Path</title>

Abstract: We define the problem of linear Contextual Stochastic Shortest Path (CSSP), where at the beginning of each episode, the learner observes an adversarially chosen context that determines the MDP through a fixed but unknown linear function. The learner's objective is to reach a designated goal state with minimal expected cumulative loss, despite having no prior knowledge of the transition dynamics, loss functions, or the mapping from context to MDP. In this work, we propose LR-CSSP, an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(K^{2/3} d^{2/3} |S| |A|^{1/3} B_\star^2 T_\star \log (1/ \delta))$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ is the context dimension, $S$ and $A$ are the sets of states and actions respectively, $B_\star$ bounds the optimal cumulative loss and $T_\star$, unknown to the learner, bounds the expected time for the optimal policy to reach the goal. In the case where all costs exceed $\ell_{\min}$, LR-CSSP attains a regret of $\widetilde O(\sqrt{K \cdot d^2 |S|^3 |A| B_\star^3 \log(1/\delta)/\ell_{\min}})$. Unlike in contextual finite-horizon MDPs, where limited knowledge primarily leads to higher losses and regret, in the CSSP setting, insufficient knowledge can also prolong episodes and may even lead to non-terminating episodes. Our analysis reveals that LR-CSSP effectively handles continuous context spaces, while ensuring all episodes terminate within a reasonable number of time steps.

<title>Center-Outward q-Dominance: A Sample-Computable Proxy for Strong Stochastic Dominance in Multi-Objective Optimisation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12545</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic multi-objective optimization (SMOOP) requires ranking multivariate distributions; yet, most empirical studies perform scalarization, which loses information and is unreliable. Based on the optimal transport theory, we introduce the center-outward q-dominance relation and prove it implies strong first-order stochastic dominance (FSD). Also, we develop an empirical test procedure based on q-dominance, and derive an explicit sample size threshold, $n^*(\delta)$, to control the Type I error. We verify the usefulness of our approach in two scenarios: (1) as a ranking method in hyperparameter tuning; (2) as a selection method in multi-objective optimization algorithms. For the former, we analyze the final stochastic Pareto sets of seven multi-objective hyperparameter tuners on the YAHPO-MO benchmark tasks with q-dominance, which allows us to compare these tuners when the expected hypervolume indicator (HVI, the most common performance metric) of the Pareto sets becomes indistinguishable. For the latter, we replace the mean value-based selection in the NSGA-II algorithm with $q$-dominance, which shows a superior convergence rate on noise-augmented ZDT benchmark problems. These results establish center-outward q-dominance as a principled, tractable foundation for seeking truly stochastically dominant solutions for SMOOPs.

<title>CAO: Curvature-Adaptive Optimization via Periodic Low-Rank Hessian Sketching</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12548</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order optimizers are reliable but slow in sharp, anisotropic regions. We study a curvature-adaptive method that periodically sketches a low-rank Hessian subspace via Hessian--vector products and preconditions gradients only in that subspace, leaving the orthogonal complement first-order. For L-smooth non-convex objectives, we recover the standard O(1/T) stationarity guarantee with a widened stable stepsize range; under a Polyak--Lojasiewicz (PL) condition with bounded residual curvature outside the sketch, the loss contracts at refresh steps. On CIFAR-10/100 with ResNet-18/34, the method enters the low-loss region substantially earlier: measured by epochs to a pre-declared train-loss threshold (0.75), it reaches the threshold 2.95x faster than Adam on CIFAR-100/ResNet-18, while matching final test accuracy. The approach is one-knob: performance is insensitive to the sketch rank k across {1,3,5}, and k=0 yields a principled curvature-free ablation. We release anonymized logs and scripts that regenerate all figures and tables.

<title>Training Instabilities Induce Flatness Bias in Gradient Descent</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12558</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12558</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical analyses of gradient descent (GD) define a stability threshold based on the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian, often termed sharpness. When the learning rate lies below this threshold, training is stable and the loss decreases monotonically. Yet, modern deep networks often achieve their best performance beyond this regime.
  We demonstrate that such instabilities induce an implicit bias in GD, driving parameters toward flatter regions of the loss landscape and thereby improving generalization. The key mechanism is the Rotational Polarity of Eigenvectors (RPE), a geometric phenomenon in which the leading eigenvectors of the Hessian rotate during training instabilities. These rotations, which increase with learning rates, promote exploration and provably lead to flatter minima.
  This theoretical framework extends to stochastic GD, where instability-driven flattening persists and its empirical effects outweigh minibatch noise. Finally, we show that restoring instabilities in Adam further improves generalization.
  Together, these results establish and understand the constructive role of training instabilities in deep learning.

<title>Linear time small coresets for k-mean clustering of segments with applications</title>

Abstract: We study the $k$-means problem for a set $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ segments, aiming to find $k$ centers $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that minimize
  $D(\mathcal{S},X) := \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \min_{x \in X} D(S,x)$, where $D(S,x) := \int_{p \in S} |p - x| dp$
  measures the total distance from each point along a segment to a center. Variants of this problem include handling outliers, employing alternative distance functions such as M-estimators, weighting distances to achieve balanced clustering, or enforcing unique cluster assignments. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, an $\varepsilon$-coreset is a weighted subset $C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ that approximates $D(\mathcal{S},X)$ within a factor of $1 \pm \varepsilon$ for any set of $k$ centers, enabling efficient streaming, distributed, or parallel computation. We propose the first coreset construction that provably handles arbitrary input segments. For constant $k$ and $\varepsilon$, it produces a coreset of size $O(\log^2 n)$ computable in $O(nd)$ time. Experiments, including a real-time video tracking application, demonstrate substantial speedups with minimal loss in clustering accuracy, confirming both the practical efficiency and theoretical guarantees of our method.

arXiv:2511.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research aims to optimize intricate learning models by implementing quantization and bit-depth optimization techniques. The objective is to significantly cut time complexity while preserving model efficiency, thus addressing the challenge of extended execution times in intricate models. Two medical datasets were utilized as case studies to apply a Logistic Regression (LR) machine learning model. Using efficient quantization and bit depth optimization strategies the input data is downscaled from float64 to float32 and int32. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in time complexity, with only a minimal decrease in model accuracy post-optimization, showcasing the state-of-the-art optimization approach. This comprehensive study concludes that the impact of these optimization techniques varies depending on a set of parameters.

<title>LMM-IR: Large-Scale Netlist-Aware Multimodal Framework for Static IR-Drop Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12581</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static IR drop analysis is a fundamental and critical task in the field of chip design. Nevertheless, this process can be quite time-consuming, potentially requiring several hours. Moreover, addressing IR drop violations frequently demands iterative analysis, thereby causing the computational burden. Therefore, fast and accurate IR drop prediction is vital for reducing the overall time invested in chip design. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel multimodal approach that efficiently processes SPICE files through large-scale netlist transformer (LNT). Our key innovation is representing and processing netlist topology as 3D point cloud representations, enabling efficient handling of netlist with up to hundreds of thousands to millions nodes. All types of data, including netlist files and image data, are encoded into latent space as features and fed into the model for static voltage drop prediction. This enables the integration of data from multiple modalities for complementary predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can achieve the best F1 score and the lowest MAE among the winning teams of the ICCAD 2023 contest and the state-of-the-art algorithms.

<title>Symmetry-Aware Graph Metanetwork Autoencoders: Model Merging through Parameter Canonicalization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network parameterizations exhibit inherent symmetries that yield multiple equivalent minima within the loss landscape. Scale Graph Metanetworks (ScaleGMNs) explicitly leverage these symmetries by proposing an architecture equivariant to both permutation and parameter scaling transformations. Previous work by Ainsworth et al. (2023) addressed permutation symmetries through a computationally intensive combinatorial assignment problem, demonstrating that leveraging permutation symmetries alone can map networks into a shared loss basin. In this work, we extend their approach by also incorporating scaling symmetries, presenting an autoencoder framework utilizing ScaleGMNs as invariant encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that our method aligns Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) under both permutation and scaling symmetries without explicitly solving the assignment problem. This approach ensures that similar networks naturally converge within the same basin, facilitating model merging, i.e., smooth linear interpolation while avoiding regions of high loss. The code is publicly available on our GitHub repository.

<title>PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics for Faster Sampling of Generative Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12603</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics sampling suffers from extremely low generation speed, fundamentally limited by numerous fine-grained iterations to converge to the target distribution. We introduce PID-controlled Langevin Dynamics (PIDLD), a novel sampling acceleration algorithm that reinterprets the sampling process using control-theoretic principles. By treating energy gradients as feedback signals, PIDLD combines historical gradients (the integral term) and gradient trends (the derivative term) to efficiently traverse energy landscapes and adaptively stabilize, thereby significantly reducing the number of iterations required to produce high-quality samples. Our approach requires no additional training, datasets, or prior information, making it immediately integrable with any Langevin-based method. Extensive experiments across image generation and reasoning tasks demonstrate that PIDLD achieves higher quality with fewer steps, making Langevin-based generative models more practical for efficiency-critical applications. The implementation can be found at \href{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PIDLD}{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/PIDLD}.

<title>FedTopo: Topology-Informed Representation Alignment in Federated Learning under Non-I.I.D. Conditions</title>

arXiv:2511.12628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current federated-learning models deteriorate under heterogeneous (non-I.I.D.) client data, as their feature representations diverge and pixel- or patch-level objectives fail to capture the global topology which is essential for high-dimensional visual tasks. We propose FedTopo, a framework that integrates Topological-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) and Topological Embedding (TE) to leverage topological information, yielding coherently aligned cross-client representations by Topological Alignment Loss (TAL). First, Topology-Guided Block Screening (TGBS) automatically selects the most topology-informative block, i.e., the one with maximal topological separability, whose persistence-based signatures best distinguish within- versus between-class pairs, ensuring that subsequent analysis focuses on topology-rich features. Next, this block yields a compact Topological Embedding, which quantifies the topological information for each client. Finally, a Topological Alignment Loss (TAL) guides clients to maintain topological consistency with the global model during optimization, reducing representation drift across rounds. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under four non-I.I.D. partitions show that FedTopo accelerates convergence and improves accuracy over strong baselines.

Abstract: This article revisits the 20-year-old neural fitted Q-iteration (NFQ) algorithm on its classical CartPole benchmark. NFQ was a pioneering approach towards modern Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) in applying multi-layer neural networks to reinforcement learning for real-world control problems. We explore the algorithm's conceptual simplicity and its transition from online to batch learning, which contributed to its stability. Despite its initial success, NFQ required extensive tuning and was not easily reproducible on real-world control problems. We propose a modernized variant NFQ2.0 and apply it to the CartPole task, concentrating on a real-world system build from standard industrial components, to investigate and improve the learning process's repeatability and robustness. Through ablation studies, we highlight key design decisions and hyperparameters that enhance performance and stability of NFQ2.0 over the original variant. Finally, we demonstrate how our findings can assist practitioners in reproducing and improving results and applying deep reinforcement learning more effectively in industrial contexts.

<title>Sample Complexity of Agnostic Multiclass Classification: Natarajan Dimension Strikes Back</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12659</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental theorem of statistical learning states that binary PAC learning is governed by a single parameter -- the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension -- which determines both learnability and sample complexity. Extending this to multiclass classification has long been challenging, since Natarajan's work in the late 80s proposing the Natarajan dimension (Nat) as a natural analogue of VC. Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014) introduced the DS dimension, later shown by Brukhim et al. (2022) to characterize multiclass learnability. Brukhim et al. also showed that Nat and DS can diverge arbitrarily, suggesting that multiclass learning is governed by DS rather than Nat. We show that agnostic multiclass PAC sample complexity is in fact governed by two distinct dimensions. Specifically, we prove nearly tight agnostic sample complexity bounds that, up to log factors, take the form $\frac{DS^{1.5}}{\epsilon} + \frac{Nat}{\epsilon^2}$ where $\epsilon$ is the excess risk. This bound is tight up to a $\sqrt{DS}$ factor in the first term, nearly matching known $Nat/\epsilon^2$ and $DS/\epsilon$ lower bounds. The first term reflects the DS-controlled regime, while the second shows that the Natarajan dimension still dictates asymptotic behavior for small $\epsilon$. Thus, unlike binary or online classification -- where a single dimension (VC or Littlestone) controls both phenomena -- multiclass learning inherently involves two structural parameters. Our technical approach departs from traditional agnostic learning methods based on uniform convergence or reductions to realizable cases. A key ingredient is a novel online procedure based on a self-adaptive multiplicative-weights algorithm performing a label-space reduction, which may be of independent interest.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model while preserving the privacy of their local data. Within this paradigm, the intellectual property rights (IPR) of client models are critical assets that must be protected. In practice, the central server responsible for maintaining the global model may maliciously manipulate the global model to erase client contributions or falsely claim sole ownership, thereby infringing on clients' IPR. Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique for asserting model ownership and protecting intellectual property. However, existing FL watermarking approaches remain limited, suffering from potential watermark collisions among clients, insufficient watermark security, and non-intuitive verification mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FLClear, a novel framework that simultaneously achieves collision-free watermark aggregation, enhanced watermark security, and visually interpretable ownership verification. Specifically, FLClear introduces a transposed model jointly optimized with contrastive learning to integrate the watermarking and main task objectives. During verification, the watermark is reconstructed from the transposed model and evaluated through both visual inspection and structural similarity metrics, enabling intuitive and quantitative ownership verification. Comprehensive experiments conducted over various datasets, aggregation schemes, and attack scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of FLClear and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL watermarking methods.

arXiv:2511.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather prediction is a quintessential problem involving the forecasting of a complex, nonlinear, and chaotic high-dimensional dynamical system. This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized, privacy-preserving model training but struggles to balance global generalization and local personalization due to non-identical data distributions across clients. Personalized Fine-Tuning (PFT), a popular post-hoc solution, fine-tunes the final global model locally but often overfits to skewed client distributions or fails under domain shifts. We propose adapting Linear Probing followed by full Fine-Tuning (LP-FT), a principled centralized strategy for alleviating feature distortion (Kumar et al., 2022), to the FL setting. Through systematic evaluation across seven datasets and six PFT variants, we demonstrate LP-FT's superiority in balancing personalization and generalization. Our analysis uncovers federated feature distortion, a phenomenon where local fine-tuning destabilizes globally learned features, and theoretically characterizes how LP-FT mitigates this via phased parameter updates. We further establish conditions (e.g., partial feature overlap, covariate-concept shift) under which LP-FT outperforms standard fine-tuning, offering actionable guidelines for deploying robust personalization in FL.

arXiv:2511.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training general agents to follow complex instructions (tasks) in intricate environments (levels) remains a core challenge in reinforcement learning. Random sampling of task-level pairs often produces unsolvable combinations, highlighting the need to co-design tasks and levels. While unsupervised environment design (UED) has proven effective at automatically designing level curricula, prior work has only considered a fixed task. We present ATLAS (Aligning Tasks and Levels for Autocurricula of Specifications), a novel method that generates joint autocurricula over tasks and levels. Our approach builds upon UED to automatically produce solvable yet challenging task-level pairs for policy training. To evaluate ATLAS and drive progress in the field, we introduce an evaluation suite that models tasks as reward machines in Minigrid levels. Experiments demonstrate that ATLAS vastly outperforms random sampling approaches, particularly when sampling solvable pairs is unlikely. We further show that mutations leveraging the structure of both tasks and levels accelerate convergence to performant policies.

<title>Adaptive Graph Rewiring to Mitigate Over-Squashing in Mesh-Based GNNs for Fluid Dynamics Simulations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12709</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh-based simulation using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been recognized as a promising approach for modeling fluid dynamics. However, the mesh refinement techniques which allocate finer resolution to regions with steep gradients can induce the over-squashing problem in mesh-based GNNs, which prevents the capture of long-range physical interactions. Conventional graph rewiring methods attempt to alleviate this issue by adding new edges, but they typically complete all rewiring operations before applying them to the GNN. These approaches are physically unrealistic, as they assume instantaneous interactions between distant nodes and disregard the distance information between particles. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, called Adaptive Graph Rewiring in Mesh-Based Graph Neural Networks (AdaMeshNet), that introduces an adaptive rewiring process into the message-passing procedure to model the gradual propagation of physical interactions. Our method computes a rewiring delay score for bottleneck nodes in the mesh graph, based on the shortest-path distance and the velocity difference. Using this score, it dynamically selects the message-passing layer at which new edges are rewired, which can lead to adaptive rewiring in a mesh graph. Extensive experiments on mesh-based fluid simulations demonstrate that AdaMeshNet outperforms conventional rewiring methods, effectively modeling the sequential nature of physical interactions and enabling more accurate predictions.

It has been applied to various domains, including drug-target interactions, RNA-disease associations, and regulatory network inference. Despite being widely investigated, current methods still present drawbacks, as they are often designed for a specific application and thus do not generalize to other problems or present scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose Oxytrees: proxy-based biclustering model trees. Oxytrees compress the interaction matrix into row- and column-wise proxy matrices, significantly reducing training time without compromising predictive performance. We also propose a new leaf-assignment algorithm that significantly reduces the time taken for prediction. Finally, Oxytrees employ linear models using the Kronecker product kernel in their leaves, resulting in shallower trees and thus even faster training. Using 15 datasets, we compared the predictive performance of ensembles of Oxytrees with that of the current state-of-the-art. We achieved up to 30-fold improvement in training times compared to state-of-the-art biclustering forests, while demonstrating competitive or superior performance in most evaluation settings, particularly in the inductive setting. Finally, we provide an intuitive Python API to access all datasets, methods and evaluation measures used in this work, thus enabling reproducible research in this field.

Abstract: Data poisoning is a training-time attack that undermines the trustworthiness of learned models. In a targeted data poisoning attack, an adversary manipulates the training dataset to alter the classification of a targeted test point. Given the typically large size of training dataset, manual detection of poisoning is difficult. An alternative is to automatically measure a dataset's robustness against such an attack, which is the focus of this paper. We consider a threat model wherein an adversary can only perturb the labels of the training dataset, with knowledge limited to the hypothesis space of the victim's model. In this setting, we prove that finding the robustness is an NP-Complete problem, even when hypotheses are linear classifiers. To overcome this, we present a technique that finds lower and upper bounds of robustness. Our implementation of the technique computes these bounds efficiently in practice for many publicly available datasets. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, a poisoning exceeding the identified robustness bounds significantly impacts test point classification. We are also able to compute these bounds in many more cases where state-of-the-art techniques fail.

<title>LAYA: Layer-wise Attention Aggregation for Interpretable Depth-Aware Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically rely on the representation produced by their final hidden layer to make predictions, implicitly assuming that this single vector fully captures the semantics encoded across all preceding transformations. However, intermediate layers contain rich and complementary information -- ranging from low-level patterns to high-level abstractions -- that is often discarded when the decision head depends solely on the last representation. This paper revisits the role of the output layer and introduces LAYA (Layer-wise Attention Aggregator), a novel output head that dynamically aggregates internal representations through attention. Instead of projecting only the deepest embedding, LAYA learns input-conditioned attention weights over layer-wise features, yielding an interpretable and architecture-agnostic mechanism for synthesizing predictions. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that LAYA consistently matches or improves the performance of standard output heads, with relative gains of up to about one percentage point in accuracy, while providing explicit layer-attribution scores that reveal how different abstraction levels contribute to each decision. Crucially, these interpretability signals emerge directly from the model's computation, without any external post hoc explanations. The code to reproduce LAYA is publicly available at: https://github.com/gvessio/LAYA.

Abstract: A method for creating a forest of model trees to fit samples of a function defined on images is described in several steps: down-sampling the images, determining a tree's hyperplanes, applying convolutions to the hyperplanes to handle small distortions of training images, and creating forests of model trees to increase accuracy and achieve a smooth fit. A 1-to-1 correspondence among pixels of images, coefficients of hyperplanes and coefficients of leaf functions offers the possibility of dealing with larger distortions such as arbitrary rotations or changes of perspective. A theoretical method for smoothing forest outputs to produce a continuously differentiable approximation is described. Within that framework, a training procedure is proved to converge.

<title>Stabilizing Self-Consuming Diffusion Models with Latent Space Filtering</title>

Abstract: As synthetic data proliferates across the Internet, it is often reused to train successive generations of generative models. This creates a ``self-consuming loop" that can lead to training instability or \textit{model collapse}. Common strategies to address the issue -- such as accumulating historical training data or injecting fresh real data -- either increase computational cost or require expensive human annotation. In this paper, we empirically analyze the latent space dynamics of self-consuming diffusion models and observe that the low-dimensional structure of latent representations extracted from synthetic data degrade over generations. Based on this insight, we propose \textit{Latent Space Filtering} (LSF), a novel approach that mitigates model collapse by filtering out less realistic synthetic data from mixed datasets. Theoretically, we present a framework that connects latent space degradation to empirical observations. Experimentally, we show that LSF consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple real-world datasets, effectively mitigating model collapse without increasing training cost or relying on human annotation.

<title>DIVIDE: A Framework for Learning from Independent Multi-Mechanism Data Using Deep Encoders and Gaussian Processes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific datasets often arise from multiple independent mechanisms such as spatial, categorical or structural effects, whose combined influence obscures their individual contributions. We introduce DIVIDE, a framework that disentangles these influences by integrating mechanism-specific deep encoders with a structured Gaussian Process in a joint latent space. Disentanglement here refers to separating independently acting generative factors. The encoders isolate distinct mechanisms while the Gaussian Process captures their combined effect with calibrated uncertainty. The architecture supports structured priors, enabling interpretable and mechanism-aware prediction as well as efficient active learning. DIVIDE is demonstrated on synthetic datasets combining categorical image patches with nonlinear spatial fields, on FerroSIM spin lattice simulations of ferroelectric patterns, and on experimental PFM hysteresis loops from PbTiO3 films. Across benchmarks, DIVIDE separates mechanisms, reproduces additive and scaled interactions, and remains robust under noise. The framework extends naturally to multifunctional datasets where mechanical, electromagnetic or optical responses coexist.

<title>Are LLMs The Way Forward? A Case Study on LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.

arXiv:2511.12760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Conformal Online Learning of Koopman embeddings (COLoKe), a novel framework for adaptively updating Koopman-invariant representations of nonlinear dynamical systems from streaming data. Our modeling approach combines deep feature learning with multistep prediction consistency in the lifted space, where the dynamics evolve linearly. To prevent overfitting, COLoKe employs a conformal-style mechanism that shifts the focus from evaluating the conformity of new states to assessing the consistency of the current Koopman model. Updates are triggered only when the current model's prediction error exceeds a dynamically calibrated threshold, allowing selective refinement of the Koopman operator and embedding. Empirical results on benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate the effectiveness of COLoKe in maintaining long-term predictive accuracy while significantly reducing unnecessary updates and avoiding overfitting.

<title>INC: An Indirect Neural Corrector for Auto-Regressive Hybrid PDE Solvers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12764</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When simulating partial differential equations, hybrid solvers combine coarse numerical solvers with learned correctors. They promise accelerated simulations while adhering to physical constraints. However, as shown in our theoretical framework, directly applying learned corrections to solver outputs leads to significant autoregressive errors, which originate from amplified perturbations that accumulate during long-term rollouts, especially in chaotic regimes. To overcome this, we propose the Indirect Neural Corrector (\(\mathrm{INC}\)), which integrates learned corrections into the governing equations rather than applying direct state updates. Our key insight is that \(\mathrm{INC}\) reduces the error amplification on the order of \(\Delta t^{-1} + L\), where \(\Delta t\) is the timestep and $L$ the Lipschitz constant. At the same time, our framework poses no architectural requirements and integrates seamlessly with arbitrary neural networks and solvers. We test \(\mathrm{INC}\) in extensive benchmarks, covering numerous differentiable solvers, neural backbones, and test cases ranging from a 1D chaotic system to 3D turbulence. INC improves the long-term trajectory performance (\(R^2\)) by up to 158.7\%, stabilizes blowups under aggressive coarsening, and for complex 3D turbulence cases yields speed-ups of several orders of magnitude. INC thus enables stable, efficient PDE emulation with formal error reduction, paving the way for faster scientific and engineering simulations with reliable physics guarantees.

Abstract: Understanding and continuously refining multimodal molecular knowledge is crucial for advancing biomedicine, chemistry, and materials science. Molecule language models (MoLMs) have become powerful tools in these domains, integrating structural representations (e.g., SMILES strings, molecular graphs) with rich contextual descriptions (e.g., physicochemical properties). However, MoLMs can encode and propagate inaccuracies due to outdated web-mined training corpora or malicious manipulation, jeopardizing downstream discovery pipelines. While knowledge editing has been explored for general-domain AI, its application to MoLMs remains uncharted, presenting unique challenges due to the multifaceted and interdependent nature of molecular knowledge. In this paper, we take the first step toward MoLM editing for two critical tasks: molecule-to-caption generation and caption-to-molecule generation. To address molecule-specific challenges, we propose MolEdit, a powerful framework that enables targeted modifications while preserving unrelated molecular knowledge. MolEdit combines a Multi-Expert Knowledge Adapter that routes edits to specialized experts for different molecular facets with an Expertise-Aware Editing Switcher that activates the adapters only when input closely matches the stored edits across all expertise, minimizing interference with unrelated knowledge. To systematically evaluate editing performance, we introduce MEBench, a comprehensive benchmark assessing multiple dimensions, including Reliability (accuracy of the editing), Locality (preservation of irrelevant knowledge), and Generality (robustness to reformed queries). Across extensive experiments on two popular MoLM backbones, MolEdit delivers up to 18.8% higher Reliability and 12.0% better Locality than baselines while maintaining efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/LzyFischer/MolEdit.

<title>Scalable Multi-Objective and Meta Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Estimation</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of efficiently estimating policies that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). Given $n$ objectives (or tasks), we seek the optimal partition of these objectives into $k \ll n$ groups, where each group comprises related objectives that can be trained together. This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm. Based on the estimated affinity score matrix, we cluster the $n$ objectives into $k$ groups by maximizing the intra-cluster affinity scores. Experiments on three robotic control and the Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $16\%$ on average, while delivering up to $26\times$ faster speedup relative to performing full training to obtain the clusters. Ablation studies validate each component of our approach. For instance, compared with random grouping and gradient-similarity-based grouping, our loss-based clustering yields an improvement of $19\%$. Finally, we analyze the generalization error of policy networks by measuring the Hessian trace of the loss surface, which gives non-vacuous measures relative to the observed generalization errors.

Abstract: The semiconductor industry faces a computational crisis in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography optimization, where traditional methods consume billions of CPU hours while failing to achieve sub-nanometer precision. We present a physics-constrained adaptive learning framework that automatically calibrates electromagnetic approximations through learnable parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{\theta_d, \theta_a, \theta_b, \theta_p, \theta_c\}$ while simultaneously minimizing Edge Placement Error (EPE) between simulated aerial images and target photomasks. The framework integrates differentiable modules for Fresnel diffraction, material absorption, optical point spread function blur, phase-shift effects, and contrast modulation with direct geometric pattern matching objectives, enabling cross-geometry generalization with minimal training data. Through physics-constrained learning on 15 representative patterns spanning current production to future research nodes, we demonstrate consistent sub-nanometer EPE performance (0.664-2.536 nm range) using only 50 training samples per pattern. Adaptive physics learning achieves an average improvement of 69.9\% over CNN baselines without physics constraints, with a significant inference speedup over rigorous electromagnetic solvers after training completion. This approach requires 90\% fewer training samples through cross-geometry generalization compared to pattern-specific CNN training approaches. This work establishes physics-constrained adaptive learning as a foundational methodology for real-time semiconductor manufacturing optimization, addressing the critical gap between academic physics-informed neural networks and industrial deployment requirements through joint physics calibration and manufacturing precision objectives.

<title>Optimal Look-back Horizon for Time Series Forecasting in Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate look-back horizon remains a fundamental challenge in time series forecasting (TSF), particularly in the federated learning scenarios where data is decentralized, heterogeneous, and often non-independent. While recent work has explored horizon selection by preserving forecasting-relevant information in an intrinsic space, these approaches are primarily restricted to centralized and independently distributed settings. This paper presents a principled framework for adaptive horizon selection in federated time series forecasting through an intrinsic space formulation. We introduce a synthetic data generator (SDG) that captures essential temporal structures in client data, including autoregressive dependencies, seasonality, and trend, while incorporating client-specific heterogeneity. Building on this model, we define a transformation that maps time series windows into an intrinsic representation space with well-defined geometric and statistical properties. We then derive a decomposition of the forecasting loss into a Bayesian term, which reflects irreducible uncertainty, and an approximation term, which accounts for finite-sample effects and limited model capacity. Our analysis shows that while increasing the look-back horizon improves the identifiability of deterministic patterns, it also increases approximation error due to higher model complexity and reduced sample efficiency. We prove that the total forecasting loss is minimized at the smallest horizon where the irreducible loss starts to saturate, while the approximation loss continues to rise. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for adaptive horizon selection for time series forecasting in federated learning.

arXiv:2511.12797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) -- the capacity of a model to infer and apply abstract patterns from examples provided within its input -- has been extensively studied in large language models trained for next-token prediction on human text. In fact, prior work often attributes this emergent behavior to distinctive statistical properties in human language. This raises a fundamental question: can ICL arise organically in other sequence domains purely through large-scale predictive training?
  To explore this, we turn to genomic sequences, an alternative symbolic domain rich in statistical structure. Specifically, we study the Evo2 genomic model, trained predominantly on next-nucleotide (A/T/C/G) prediction, at a scale comparable to mid-sized LLMs. We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of organically emergent ICL in genomic sequences, supporting the hypothesis that ICL arises as a consequence of large-scale predictive modeling over rich data. These findings extend emergent meta-learning beyond language, pointing toward a unified, modality-agnostic view of in-context learning.

arXiv:2511.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In self-consuming generative models that train on their own outputs, alignment with user preferences becomes a recursive rather than one-time process. We provide the first formal foundation for analyzing the long-term effects of such recursive retraining on alignment. Under a two-stage curation mechanism based on the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, we model alignment as an interaction between two factions: the Model Owner, who filters which outputs should be learned by the model, and the Public User, who determines which outputs are ultimately shared and retained through interactions with the model. Our analysis reveals three structural convergence regimes depending on the degree of preference alignment: consensus collapse, compromise on shared optima, and asymmetric refinement. We prove a fundamental impossibility theorem: no recursive BT-based curation mechanism can simultaneously preserve diversity, ensure symmetric influence, and eliminate dependence on initialization. Framing the process as dynamic social choice, we show that alignment is not a static goal but an evolving equilibrium, shaped both by power asymmetries and path dependence.

Abstract: Specifying informative and dense reward functions remains a pivotal challenge in Reinforcement Learning, as it directly affects the efficiency of agent training. In this work, we harness the expressive power of quantitative Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (($\text{LTL}_f[\mathcal{F}]$)) to synthesize reward monitors that generate a dense stream of rewards for runtime-observable state trajectories. By providing nuanced feedback during training, these monitors guide agents toward optimal behaviour and help mitigate the well-known issue of sparse rewards under long-horizon decision making, which arises under the Boolean semantics dominating the current literature. Our framework is algorithm-agnostic and only relies on a state labelling function, and naturally accommodates specifying non-Markovian properties. Empirical results show that our quantitative monitors consistently subsume and, depending on the environment, outperform Boolean monitors in maximizing a quantitative measure of task completion and in reducing convergence time.

Abstract: The recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs) holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare, with strong capabilities in diverse medical tasks. Yet, deploying LLMs in high-stakes healthcare settings requires rigorous verification and validation to understand any potential harm. This paper investigates the reliability and viability of using medical knowledge graphs (KGs) for the automated factuality evaluation of LLM-generated responses. To ground this investigation, we introduce FAITH, a framework designed to systematically probe the strengths and limitations of this KG-based approach. FAITH operates without reference answers by decomposing responses into atomic claims, linking them to a medical KG, and scoring them based on evidence paths. Experiments on diverse medical tasks with human subjective evaluations demonstrate that KG-grounded evaluation achieves considerably higher correlations with clinician judgments and can effectively distinguish LLMs with varying capabilities. It is also robust to textual variances. The inherent explainability of its scoring can further help users understand and mitigate the limitations of current LLMs. We conclude that while limitations exist, leveraging KGs is a prominent direction for automated factuality assessment in healthcare.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a longstanding challenge in continual learning, where models lose knowledge from earlier tasks when learning new ones. While various mitigation strategies have been proposed for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), recent architectural advances like Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been suggested to offer intrinsic resistance to forgetting by leveraging localized spline-based activations. However, the practical behavior of KANs under continual learning remains unclear, and their limitations are not well understood. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of catastrophic forgetting in KANs and develop a theoretical framework that links forgetting to activation support overlap and intrinsic data dimension. We validate these analyses through systematic experiments on synthetic and vision tasks, measuring forgetting dynamics under varying model configurations and data complexity. Further, we introduce KAN-LoRA, a novel adapter design for parameter-efficient continual fine-tuning of language models, and evaluate its effectiveness in knowledge editing tasks. Our findings reveal that while KANs exhibit promising retention in low-dimensional algorithmic settings, they remain vulnerable to forgetting in high-dimensional domains such as image classification and language modeling. These results advance the understanding of KANs' strengths and limitations, offering practical insights for continual learning system design.

Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of representation learning objectives for particle physics within a unified framework. Our study employs a shared transformer-based particle-cloud encoder with standardized preprocessing, matched sampling, and a consistent evaluation protocol on a jet classification dataset. We compare contrastive (supervised and self-supervised), masked particle modeling, and generative reconstruction objectives under a common training regimen. In addition, we introduce targeted supervised architectural modifications that achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark evaluations. This controlled comparison isolates the contributions of the learning objective, highlights their respective strengths and limitations, and provides reproducible baselines. We position this work as a reference point for the future development of foundation models in particle physics, enabling more transparent and robust progress across the community.

<title>Connectivity-Guided Sparsification of 2-FWL GNNs: Preserving Full Expressivity with Improved Efficiency</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12838</link>

arXiv:2511.12838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order Graph Neural Networks (HOGNNs) based on the 2-FWL test achieve superior expressivity by modeling 2- and 3-node interactions, but at $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ computational cost. However, this computational burden is typically mitigated by existing efficiency methods at the cost of reduced expressivity. We propose \textbf{Co-Sparsify}, a connectivity-aware sparsification framework that eliminates \emph{provably redundant} computations while preserving full 2-FWL expressive power. Our key insight is that 3-node interactions are expressively necessary only within \emph{biconnected components} -- maximal subgraphs where every pair of nodes lies on a cycle. Outside these components, structural relationships can be fully captured via 2-node message passing or global readout, rendering higher-order modeling unnecessary. Co-Sparsify restricts 2-node message passing to connected components and 3-node interactions to biconnected ones, removing computation without approximation or sampling. We prove that Co-Sparsified GNNs are as expressive as the 2-FWL test. Empirically, on PPGN, Co-Sparsify matches or exceeds accuracy on synthetic substructure counting tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks (ZINC, QM9). This study demonstrates that high expressivity and scalability are not mutually exclusive: principled, topology-guided sparsification enables powerful, efficient GNNs with theoretical guarantees.

<title>RoS-Guard: Robust and Scalable Online Change Detection with Delay-Optimal Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Online change detection (OCD) aims to rapidly identify change points in streaming data and is critical in applications such as power system monitoring, wireless network sensing, and financial anomaly detection. Existing OCD methods typically assume precise system knowledge, which is unrealistic due to estimation errors and environmental variations. Moreover, existing OCD methods often struggle with efficiency in large-scale systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose RoS-Guard, a robust and optimal OCD algorithm tailored for linear systems with uncertainty. Through a tight relaxation and reformulation of the OCD optimization problem, RoS-Guard employs neural unrolling to enable efficient parallel computation via GPU acceleration. The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on performance, including expected false alarm rate and worst-case average detection delay. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoS-Guard and demonstrate significant computational speedup in large-scale system scenarios.

<title>From Black-Box to White-Box: Control-Theoretic Neural Network Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve state of the art performance but remain difficult to interpret mechanistically. In this work, we propose a control theoretic framework that treats a trained neural network as a nonlinear state space system and uses local linearization, controllability and observability Gramians, and Hankel singular values to analyze its internal computation. For a given input, we linearize the network around the corresponding hidden activation pattern and construct a state space model whose state consists of hidden neuron activations. The input state and state output Jacobians define local controllability and observability Gramians, from which we compute Hankel singular values and associated modes. These quantities provide a principled notion of neuron and pathway importance: controllability measures how easily each neuron can be excited by input perturbations, observability measures how strongly each neuron influences the output, and Hankel singular values rank internal modes that carry input output energy. We illustrate the framework on simple feedforward networks, including a 1 2 2 1 SwiGLU network and a 2 3 3 2 GELU network. By comparing different operating points, we show how activation saturation reduces controllability, shrinks the dominant Hankel singular value, and shifts the dominant internal mode to a different subset of neurons. The proposed method turns a neural network into a collection of local white box dynamical models and suggests which internal directions are natural candidates for pruning or constraints to improve interpretability.

arXiv:2511.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a project with stochastic activity durations and cash flows under discrete scenarios, where activities must satisfy precedence constraints generating cash inflows and outflows. The objective is to maximize expected net present value (NPV) by accelerating inflows and deferring outflows. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) approach. Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness. These results indicate that DDQN not only achieves higher expected NPV in complex project optimization but also provides a reliable framework for stable and effective policy implementation.

<title>On the Fundamental Limits of LLMs at Scale</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.

<title>On the Information Processing of One-Dimensional Wasserstein Distances with Finite Samples</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Leveraging the Wasserstein distance -- a summation of sample-wise transport distances in data space -- is advantageous in many applications for measuring support differences between two underlying density functions. However, when supports significantly overlap while densities exhibit substantial pointwise differences, it remains unclear whether and how this transport information can accurately identify these differences, particularly their analytic characterization in finite-sample settings. We address this issue by conducting an analysis of the information processing capabilities of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance with finite samples. By utilizing the Poisson process and isolating the rate factor, we demonstrate the capability of capturing the pointwise density difference with Wasserstein distances and how this information harmonizes with support differences. The analyzed properties are confirmed using neural spike train decoding and amino acid contact frequency data. The results reveal that the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance highlights meaningful density differences related to both rate and support.

<title>Method of Manufactured Learning for Solver-free Training of Neural Operators</title>

Abstract: Training neural operators to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces often requires extensive datasets generated by either demanding experimental setups or computationally expensive numerical solvers. This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training.

Abstract: We present Functional Mean Flow (FMF) as a one-step generative model defined in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. FMF extends the one-step Mean Flow framework to functional domains by providing a theoretical formulation for Functional Flow Matching and a practical implementation for efficient training and sampling. We also introduce an $x_1$-prediction variant that improves stability over the original $u$-prediction form. The resulting framework is a practical one-step Flow Matching method applicable to a wide range of functional data generation tasks such as time series, images, PDEs, and 3D geometry.

<title>Contrastive Entropy Bounds for Density and Conditional Density Decomposition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the interpretability of neural network features from a Bayesian Gaussian view, where optimizing a cost is reaching a probabilistic bound; learning a model approximates a density that makes the bound tight and the cost optimal, often with a Gaussian mixture density. The two examples are Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) using the bound for the marginal and autoencoders using the conditional bound. It is a known result, not only for autoencoders, that minimizing the error between inputs and outputs maximizes the dependence between inputs and the middle.
  We use Hilbert space and decomposition to address cases where a multiple-output network produces multiple centers defining a Gaussian mixture. Our first finding is that an autoencoder's objective is equivalent to maximizing the trace of a Gaussian operator, the sum of eigenvalues under bases orthonormal w.r.t. the data and model distributions. This suggests that, when a one-to-one correspondence as needed in autoencoders is unnecessary, we can instead maximize the nuclear norm of this operator, the sum of singular values, to maximize overall rank rather than trace. Thus the trace of a Gaussian operator can be used to train autoencoders, and its nuclear norm can be used as divergence to train MDNs.
  Our second test uses inner products and norms in a Hilbert space to define bounds and costs. Such bounds often have an extra norm compared to KL-based bounds, which increases sample diversity and prevents the trivial solution where a multiple-output network produces the same constant, at the cost of requiring a sample batch to estimate and optimize. We propose an encoder-mixture-decoder architecture whose decoder is multiple-output, producing multiple centers per sample, potentially tightening the bound. Assuming the data are small-variance Gaussian mixtures, this upper bound can be tracked and analyzed quantitatively.

<title>AIF: Asynchronous Inference Framework for Cost-Effective Pre-Ranking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In industrial recommendation systems, pre-ranking models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) commonly adopt a sequential execution framework: feature fetching and model forward computation are triggered only after receiving candidates from the upstream retrieval stage. This design introduces inherent bottlenecks, including redundant computations of identical users/items and increased latency due to strictly sequential operations, which jointly constrain the model's capacity and system efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the Asynchronous Inference Framework (AIF), a cost-effective computational architecture that decouples interaction-independent components, those operating within a single user or item, from real-time prediction. AIF reorganizes the model inference process by performing user-side computations in parallel with the retrieval stage and conducting item-side computations in a nearline manner. This means that interaction-independent components are calculated just once and completed before the real-time prediction phase of the pre-ranking stage. As a result, AIF enhances computational efficiency and reduces latency, freeing up resources to significantly improve the feature set and model architecture of interaction-independent components. Moreover, we delve into model design within the AIF framework, employing approximated methods for interaction-dependent components in online real-time predictions. By co-designing both the framework and the model, our solution achieves notable performance gains without significantly increasing computational and latency costs. This has enabled the successful deployment of AIF in the Taobao display advertising system.

<title>APT: Affine Prototype-Timestamp For Time Series Forecasting Under Distribution Shift</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting under distribution shift remains challenging, as existing deep learning models often rely on local statistical normalization (e.g., mean and variance) that fails to capture global distribution shift. Methods like RevIN and its variants attempt to decouple distribution and pattern but still struggle with missing values, noisy observations, and invalid channel-wise affine transformation. To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift.

<title>A FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series</title>

arXiv:2511.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are inherently volatile and prone to sudden disruptions such as market crashes, flash collapses, and liquidity crises. Accurate anomaly detection and early risk forecasting in financial time series are therefore crucial for preventing systemic instability and supporting informed investment decisions. Traditional deep learning models, such as LSTM and GRU, often fail to capture long-term dependencies and complex periodic patterns in highly nonstationary financial data. To address this limitation, this study proposes a FEDformer-Based Hybrid Framework for Anomaly Detection and Risk Forecasting in Financial Time Series, which integrates the Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer (FEDformer) with a residual-based anomaly detector and a risk forecasting head. The FEDformer module models temporal dynamics in both time and frequency domains, decomposing signals into trend and seasonal components for improved interpretability. The residual-based detector identifies abnormal fluctuations by analyzing prediction errors, while the risk head predicts potential financial distress using learned latent embeddings. Experiments conducted on the S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Brent Crude Oil datasets (2000-2024) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over benchmark methods, achieving a 15.7 percent reduction in RMSE and an 11.5 percent improvement in F1-score for anomaly detection. These results confirm the effectiveness of the model in capturing financial volatility, enabling reliable early-warning systems for market crash prediction and risk management.

<title>Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion for Enhanced Solar Flare Prediction from Multivariate Time Series</title>

Abstract: Multivariate time series classification is increasingly investigated in space weather research as a means to predict intense solar flare events, which can cause widespread disruptions across modern technological systems. Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a critical paradigm for building reliable, knowledge-intensive Large Language Model (LLM) applications. However, the multi-stage pipeline (retrieve, generate) and unique workload characteristics (e.g., knowledge dependency) of RAG systems pose significant challenges for serving performance optimization. Existing generic LLM inference traces fail to capture these RAG-specific dynamics, creating a significant performance gap between academic research and real-world deployment. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RAGPulse, an open-source RAG workload trace dataset. This dataset was collected from an university-wide Q&amp;A system serving that has served more than 40,000 students and faculties since April 2024. We detail RAGPulse's system architecture, its privacy-preserving hash-based data format, and provide an in-depth statistical analysis. Our analysis reveals that real-world RAG workloads exhibit significant temporal locality and a highly skewed hot document access pattern. RAGPulse provides a high-fidelity foundation for researchers to develop and validate novel optimization strategies for RAG systems, such as content-aware batching and retrieval caching, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of RAG services. The code is available at https://github.com/flashserve/RAGPulse.

Abstract: Adversarial examples in neural networks have been extensively studied in Euclidean geometry, but recent advances in \textit{hyperbolic networks} call for a reevaluation of attack strategies in non-Euclidean geometries. Existing methods such as FGSM and PGD apply perturbations without regard to the underlying hyperbolic structure, potentially leading to inefficient or geometrically inconsistent attacks. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack that explicitly leverages the geometric properties of hyperbolic space. Specifically, we compute the gradient of the loss function in the tangent space of hyperbolic space, decompose it into a radial (depth) component and an angular (semantic) component, and apply perturbation derived solely from the angular direction. Our method generates adversarial examples by focusing perturbations in semantically sensitive directions encoded in angular movement within the hyperbolic geometry. Empirical results on image classification, cross-modal retrieval tasks and network architectures demonstrate that our attack achieves higher fooling rates than conventional adversarial attacks, while producing high-impact perturbations with deeper insights into vulnerabilities of hyperbolic embeddings. This work highlights the importance of geometry-aware adversarial strategies in curved representation spaces and provides a principled framework for attacking hierarchical embeddings.

Abstract: Branch-and-Bound (B\&amp;B) is the dominant exact solution method for Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP), yet its exponential time complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale instances. The growing capabilities of machine learning have spurred efforts to improve B\&amp;B by learning data-driven branching policies. However, most existing approaches rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which tends to overfit to expert demonstrations and struggles to generalize to structurally diverse or unseen instances. In this work, we propose Tree-Gate Proximal Policy Optimization (TGPPO), a novel framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, to train a branching policy aimed at improving generalization across heterogeneous MILP instances. Our approach builds on a parameterized state space representation that dynamically captures the evolving context of the search tree. Empirical evaluations show that TGPPO often outperforms existing learning-based policies in terms of reducing the number of nodes explored and improving p-Primal-Dual Integrals (PDI), particularly in out-of-distribution instances. These results highlight the potential of RL to develop robust and adaptable branching strategies for MILP solvers.

<title>Are Graph Transformers Necessary? Efficient Long-Range Message Passing with Fractal Nodes in MPNNs</title>

arXiv:2511.13010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, but often struggle to balance local and global information. While graph Transformers aim to address this by enabling long-range interactions, they often overlook the inherent locality and efficiency of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). We propose a new concept called fractal nodes, inspired by the fractal structure observed in real-world networks. Our approach is based on the intuition that graph partitioning naturally induces fractal structure, where subgraphs often reflect the connectivity patterns of the full graph. Fractal nodes are designed to coexist with the original nodes and adaptively aggregate subgraph-level feature representations, thereby enforcing feature similarity within each subgraph. We show that fractal nodes alleviate the over-squashing problem by providing direct shortcut connections that enable long-range propagation of subgraph-level representations. Experiment results show that our method improves the expressive power of MPNNs and achieves comparable or better performance to graph Transformers while maintaining the computational efficiency of MPNN by improving the long-range dependencies of MPNN.

Abstract: Reward design is central to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and alignment research. In this work, we propose a unified framework to study hard, continuous, and hybrid reward structures for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on mathematical reasoning tasks. Using Qwen3-4B with LoRA fine-tuning on the GSM8K dataset, we formalize and empirically evaluate reward formulations that incorporate correctness, perplexity, reasoning quality, and consistency. We introduce an adaptive hybrid reward scheduler that transitions between discrete and continuous signals, balancing exploration and stability. Our results show that hybrid reward structures improve convergence speed and training stability over purely hard or continuous approaches, offering insights for alignment via adaptive reward modeling.

<title>The Final-Stage Bottleneck: A Systematic Dissection of the R-Learner for Network Causal Inference</title>

Abstract: The R-Learner is a powerful, theoretically-grounded framework for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, prized for its robustness to nuisance model errors. However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic "representation bottleneck": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent "nuisance bottleneck," linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted "Hub-Periphery Trade-off" analysis. Our findings are validated across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. We release our code as a reproducible benchmark to facilitate future research on this critical "final-stage bottleneck."

Abstract: General-purpose foundation models for neural time series can help accelerate neuroscientific discoveries and enable applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). A key component in scaling these models is population-level representation learning, which leverages information across channels to capture spatial as well as temporal structure. Population-level approaches have recently shown that such representations can be both efficient to learn on top of pretrained temporal encoders and produce useful representations for decoding a variety of downstream tasks. However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space. These results highlight handling preprocessing diversity as a key step toward building generalizable neural foundation models.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in Small Language Models (SLMs) as resource-efficient alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), their deployment on edge devices remains challenging due to unresolved efficiency gaps in model compression. While quantization has proven effective for LLMs, its applicability to SLMs is significantly underexplored, with critical questions about differing quantization bottlenecks and efficiency profiles. This paper introduces SLMQuant, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating LLM compression techniques when applied to SLMs. Through comprehensive multi-track evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks, we analyze how state-of-the-art quantization methods perform on SLMs. Our findings reveal fundamental disparities between SLMs and LLMs in quantization sensitivity, demonstrating that direct transfer of LLM-optimized techniques leads to suboptimal results due to SLMs' unique architectural characteristics and training dynamics. We identify key factors governing effective SLM quantization and propose actionable design principles for SLM-tailored compression. SLMQuant establishes a foundational framework for advancing efficient SLM deployment on low-end devices in edge applications, and provides critical insights for deploying lightweight language models in resource-constrained scenarios.

<title>One-Step Generative Policies with Q-Learning: A Reformulation of MeanFlow</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13035</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We introduce a one-step generative policy for offline reinforcement learning that maps noise directly to actions via a residual reformulation of MeanFlow, making it compatible with Q-learning. While one-step Gaussian policies enable fast inference, they struggle to capture complex, multimodal action distributions. Existing flow-based methods improve expressivity but typically rely on distillation and two-stage training when trained with Q-learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate MeanFlow to enable direct noise-to-action generation by integrating the velocity field and noise-to-action transformation into a single policy network-eliminating the need for separate velocity estimation. We explore several reformulation variants and identify an effective residual formulation that supports expressive and stable policy learning. Our method offers three key advantages: 1) efficient one-step noise-to-action generation, 2) expressive modelling of multimodal action distributions, and 3) efficient and stable policy learning via Q-learning in a single-stage training setup. Extensive experiments on 73 tasks across the OGBench and D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves strong performance in both offline and offline-to-online reinforcement learning settings.

<title>Bi-View Embedding Fusion: A Hybrid Learning Approach for Knowledge Graph's Nodes Classification Addressing Problems with Limited Data</title>

Abstract: Traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods require large amounts of data to perform well, limiting their applicability in sparse or incomplete scenarios and forcing the usage of additional synthetic data to improve the model training. To overcome this challenge, the research community is looking more and more at Graph Machine Learning (GML) as it offers a powerful alternative by using relationships within data. However, this method also faces limitations, particularly when dealing with Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which can hide huge information due to their semantic nature. This study introduces Bi-View, a novel hybrid approach that increases the informative content of node features in KGs to generate enhanced Graph Embeddings (GEs) that are used to improve GML models without relying on additional synthetic data. The proposed work combines two complementary GE techniques: Node2Vec, which captures structural patterns through unsupervised random walks, and GraphSAGE, which aggregates neighbourhood information in a supervised way. Node2Vec embeddings are first computed to represent the graph topology, and node features are then enriched with centrality-based metrics, which are used as input for the GraphSAGE model. Moreover, a fusion layer combines the original Node2Vec embeddings with the GraphSAGE-influenced representations, resulting in a dual-perspective embedding space. Such a fusion captures both topological and semantic properties of the graph, enabling the model to exploit informative features that may exist in the dataset but that are not explicitly represented. Our approach improves downstream task performance, especially in scenarios with poor initial features, giving the basis for more accurate and precise KG-enanched GML models.

<title>Generalization Bounds for Semi-supervised Matrix Completion with Distributional Side Information</title>

Abstract: We study a matrix completion problem where both the ground truth $R$ matrix and the unknown sampling distribution $P$ over observed entries are low-rank matrices, and \textit{share a common subspace}. We assume that a large amount $M$ of \textit{unlabeled} data drawn from the sampling distribution $P$ is available, together with a small amount $N$ of labeled data drawn from the same distribution and noisy estimates of the corresponding ground truth entries. This setting is inspired by recommender systems scenarios where the unlabeled data corresponds to `implicit feedback' (consisting in interactions such as purchase, click, etc. ) and the labeled data corresponds to the `explicit feedback', consisting of interactions where the user has given an explicit rating to the item. Leveraging powerful results from the theory of low-rank subspace recovery, together with classic generalization bounds for matrix completion models, we show error bounds consisting of a sum of two error terms scaling as $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{nd}{M}}\right)$ and $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{dr}{N}}\right)$ respectively, where $d$ is the rank of $P$ and $r$ is the rank of $M$. In synthetic experiments, we confirm that the true generalization error naturally splits into independent error terms corresponding to the estimations of $P$ and and the ground truth matrix $\ground$ respectively. In real-life experiments on Douban and MovieLens with most explicit ratings removed, we demonstrate that the method can outperform baselines relying only on the explicit ratings, demonstrating that our assumptions provide a valid toy theoretical setting to study the interaction between explicit and implicit feedbacks in recommender systems.

<title>Learning from the Undesirable: Robust Adaptation of Language Models without Forgetting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13052</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are often adapted through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to specialize their capabilities for downstream tasks. However, in typical scenarios where the fine-tuning data is limited, e.g., compared to pre-training, SFT can lead LMs to overfit, causing them to rely on spurious patterns within the target task or to compromise other broadly useful capabilities as a side effect of narrow specialization. In this paper, we propose Learning-from-the-Undesirable (LfU), a simple yet effective regularization scheme for SFT to mitigate overfitting issues when fine-tuning LMs with limited data. Specifically, we aim to regularize the fine-tuning process to favor solutions that are resilient to "undesirable" model updates, e.g., gradient ascent steps that steer the model toward undesirable behaviors. To this end, we propose a novel form of consistency regularization that directly aligns internal representations of the model with those after an undesirable update. By leveraging representation-level data augmentation through undesirable updates, LfU effectively promotes generalization under limited data. Our experiments on diverse LM downstream tasks show that LfU serves as an effective prior that enhances adaptability while preserving pretrained knowledge. For example, our LM from LfU achieves a 16.8% average improvement on math tasks compared to vanilla SFT on the same dataset, where the latter even leads to degraded performance on those tasks. Furthermore, LfU exhibits improved robustness to prompt variations, e.g., yielding a 92.1% lower standard deviation in output performances compared to SFT, highlighting its versatile effects.

<title>Self-Organization of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Logistic Regression Hopfield Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online decision systems routinely operate under delayed feedback and order-sensitive (noncommutative) dynamics: actions affect which observations arrive, and in what sequence. Taking a Bregman divergence $D_\Phi$ as the loss benchmark, we prove that the excess benchmark loss admits a structured lower bound $L \ge L_{\mathrm{ideal}} + g_1(\lambda) + g_2(\varepsilon_\star) + g_{12}(\lambda,\varepsilon_\star) - D_{\mathrm{ncx}}$, where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are calibrated penalties for latency and order-sensitivity, $g_{12}$ captures their geometric interaction, and $D_{\mathrm{ncx}}\ge 0$ is a nonconvexity/approximation penalty that vanishes under convex Legendre assumptions. We extend this inequality to prox-regular and weakly convex settings, obtaining robust guarantees beyond the convex case. We also give an operational recipe for estimating and monitoring the four terms via simple $2\times 2$ randomized experiments and streaming diagnostics (effective sample size, clipping rate, interaction heatmaps). The framework packages heterogeneous latency, noncommutativity, and implementation-gap effects into a single interpretable lower-bound statement that can be stress-tested and tuned in real-world systems.

<title>MACKO: Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication for Low Sparsity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental operation in the inference of sparse Large Language Models (LLMs). Because existing SpMV methods perform poorly under the low and unstructured sparsity (30-90%) commonly observed in pruned LLMs, unstructured pruning provided only limited memory reduction and speedup. We propose MACKO-SpMV, a GPU-optimized format and kernel co-designed to reduce storage overhead while preserving compatibility with the GPU's execution model. This enables efficient SpMV for unstructured sparsity without specialized hardware units (e.g., tensor cores) or format-specific precomputation. Empirical results show that at sparsity 50%, MACKO is the first approach with significant 1.5x memory reduction and 1.2-1.5x speedup over dense representation. Speedups over other SpMV baselines: 2.8-13.0x over cuSPARSE, 1.9-2.6x over Sputnik, and 2.2-2.5x over DASP. Applied to Llama2-7B pruned with Wanda to sparsity 50%, it delivers 1.5x memory reduction and 1.5x faster inference at fp16 precision. Thanks to MACKO, unstructured pruning at 50% sparsity is now justified in real-world LLM workloads.

arXiv:2511.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning over graph-structured data, yet recent studies have shown that their performance gains are beginning to plateau. In many cases, well-established models such as GCN and GAT, when appropriately tuned, can match or even exceed the performance of more complex, state-of-the-art architectures. This trend highlights a key limitation in the current landscape: the difficulty of selecting the most suitable model for a given graph task or dataset. To address this, we propose Self-Adaptive Graph Mixture of Models (SAGMM), a modular and practical framework that learns to automatically select and combine the most appropriate GNN models from a diverse pool of architectures. Unlike prior mixture-of-experts approaches that rely on variations of a single base model, SAGMM leverages architectural diversity and a topology-aware attention gating mechanism to adaptively assign experts to each node based on the structure of the input graph. To improve efficiency, SAGMM includes a pruning mechanism that reduces the number of active experts during training and inference without compromising performance. We also explore a training-efficient variant in which expert models are pretrained and frozen, and only the gating and task-specific layers are trained. We evaluate SAGMM on 16 benchmark datasets covering node classification, graph classification, regression, and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms or matches leading GNN baselines and prior mixture-based methods, offering a robust and adaptive solution for real-world graph learning.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) operate in high-pressure environments, making rapid, life-critical decisions under heavy cognitive and operational loads. We present EMSGlass, a smart-glasses system powered by EMSNet, the first multimodal multitask model for Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and EMSServe, a low-latency multimodal serving framework tailored to EMS scenarios. EMSNet integrates text, vital signs, and scene images to construct a unified real-time understanding of EMS incidents. Trained on real-world multimodal EMS datasets, EMSNet simultaneously supports up to five critical EMS tasks with superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art unimodal baselines. Built on top of PyTorch, EMSServe introduces a modality-aware model splitter and a feature caching mechanism, achieving adaptive and efficient inference across heterogeneous hardware while addressing the challenge of asynchronous modality arrival in the field. By optimizing multimodal inference execution in EMS scenarios, EMSServe achieves 1.9x -- 11.7x speedup over direct PyTorch multimodal inference. A user study evaluation with six professional EMTs demonstrates that EMSGlass enhances real-time situational awareness, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency through intuitive on-glass interaction. In addition, qualitative insights from the user study provide actionable directions for extending EMSGlass toward next-generation AI-enabled EMS systems, bridging multimodal intelligence with real-world emergency response workflows.

<title>Real-time prediction of breast cancer sites using deformation-aware graph neural network</title>

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial, enabling the establishment of appropriate treatment plans and markedly enhancing patient prognosis. While direct magnetic resonance imaging-guided biopsy demonstrates promising performance in detecting cancer lesions, its practical application is limited by prolonged procedure times and high costs. To overcome these issues, an indirect MRI-guided biopsy that allows the procedure to be performed outside of the MRI room has been proposed, but it still faces challenges in creating an accurate real-time deformable breast model. In our study, we tackled this issue by developing a graph neural network (GNN)-based model capable of accurately predicting deformed breast cancer sites in real time during biopsy procedures. An individual-specific finite element (FE) model was developed by incorporating magnetic resonance (MR) image-derived structural information of the breast and tumor to simulate deformation behaviors. A GNN model was then employed, designed to process surface displacement and distance-based graph data, enabling accurate prediction of overall tissue displacement, including the deformation of the tumor region. The model was validated using phantom and real patient datasets, achieving an accuracy within 0.2 millimeters (mm) for cancer node displacement (RMSE) and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.977 for spatial overlap with actual cancerous regions. Additionally, the model enabled real-time inference and achieved a speed-up of over 4,000 times in computational cost compared to conventional FE simulations. The proposed deformation-aware GNN model offers a promising solution for real-time tumor displacement prediction in breast biopsy, with high accuracy and real-time capability. Its integration with clinical procedures could significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of specific data from trained models to ensure privacy compliance. However, most existing methods assume full access to the original training dataset, which is often impractical. We address a more realistic yet challenging setting: few-shot zero-glance, where only a small subset of the retained data is available and the forget set is entirely inaccessible. We introduce GFOES, a novel framework comprising a Generative Feedback Network (GFN) and a two-phase fine-tuning procedure. GFN synthesises Optimal Erasure Samples (OES), which induce high loss on target classes, enabling the model to forget class-specific knowledge without access to the original forget data, while preserving performance on retained classes. The two-phase fine-tuning procedure enables aggressive forgetting in the first phase, followed by utility restoration in the second. Experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that GFOES achieves effective forgetting at both logit and representation levels, while maintaining strong performance using only 5% of the original data. Our framework offers a practical and scalable solution for privacy-preserving machine learning under data-constrained conditions.

<title>Departures: Distributional Transport for Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction with Neural Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>

Abstract: Predicting single-cell perturbation outcomes directly advances gene function analysis and facilitates drug candidate selection, making it a key driver of both basic and translational biomedical research. However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.
  To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training across decentralized data, but faces key challenges of bidirectional communication overhead and client-side data heterogeneity. To address communication costs while embracing data heterogeneity, we propose pFed1BS, a novel personalized federated learning framework that achieves extreme communication compression through one-bit random sketching. In personalized FL, the goal shifts from training a single global model to creating tailored models for each client. In our framework, clients transmit highly compressed one-bit sketches, and the server aggregates and broadcasts a global one-bit consensus. To enable effective personalization, we introduce a sign-based regularizer that guides local models to align with the global consensus while preserving local data characteristics. To mitigate the computational burden of random sketching, we employ the Fast Hadamard Transform for efficient projection. Theoretical analysis guarantees that our algorithm converges to a stationary neighborhood of the global potential function. Numerical simulations demonstrate that pFed1BS substantially reduces communication costs while achieving competitive performance compared to advanced communication-efficient FL algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning techniques not only improve the adaptability to diverse downstream tasks, but also mitigate adverse effects of model quantization. Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions.

Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) solvers are widely used in real-time control and optimization, but their computational cost often limits applicability in time-critical settings. We propose a learning-to-optimize approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict active sets in the dual active-set solver DAQP. The method exploits the structural properties of QPs by representing them as bipartite graphs and learning to identify the optimal active set for efficiently warm-starting the solver. Across varying problem sizes, the GNN consistently reduces the number of solver iterations compared to cold-starting, while performance is comparable to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) baseline. Furthermore, a GNN trained on varying problem sizes generalizes effectively to unseen dimensions, demonstrating flexibility and scalability. These results highlight the potential of structure-aware learning to accelerate optimization in real-time applications such as model predictive control.

<title>Real-time distortion prediction in metallic additive manufacturing via a physics-informed neural operator approach</title>

Abstract: With the development of digital twins and smart manufacturing systems, there is an urgent need for real-time distortion field prediction to control defects in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM). However, numerical simulation methods suffer from high computational cost, long run-times that prevent real-time use, while conventional Machine learning (ML) models struggle to extract spatiotemporal features for long-horizon prediction and fail to decouple thermo-mechanical fields. This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas. The performance of PINO surrogate model highlights its potential for real-time long-horizon physics field prediction in controlling defects.

Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy is a powerful and rapid technique widely used in medicine, material science, and chemical analyses. However, its effectiveness is hindered by the presence of a non-resonant background that interferes with and distorts the true Raman signal. Deep learning methods have been employed to reconstruct the true Raman spectrum from measured CARS data using labeled datasets. A more recent development integrates the domain knowledge of Kramers-Kronig relationships and smoothness constraints in the form of physics-informed loss functions. However, these deterministic models lack the ability to quantify uncertainty, an essential feature for reliable deployment in high-stakes scientific and biomedical applications. In this work, we evaluate and compare various uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques within the context of CARS-to-Raman signal reconstruction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating physics-informed constraints into these models improves their calibration, offering a promising path toward more trustworthy CARS data analysis.

Abstract: Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ faster convergence and 30$\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability across training iterations

<title>ParaDySe: A Parallel-Strategy Switching Framework for Dynamic Sequence Lengths in Transformer</title>

Abstract: Dynamic sequences with varying lengths have been widely used in the training of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). However, current training frameworks adopt a pre-defined static parallel strategy for these sequences, causing neither communication-parallelization cancellation on short sequences nor out-of-memory on long sequences. To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries. We compare ParaDySe with baselines on representative LLMs under datasets with sequence lengths up to 624K. Experimental results indicate that ParaDySe addresses OOM and CPC bottlenecks in LLM training by systematically integrating long-sequence optimizations with existing frameworks.

<title>TokenSqueeze: Performance-Preserving Compression for Reasoning LLMs</title>

Abstract: Emerging reasoning LLMs such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved strong performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces. However, these long CoTs result in increased token usage, leading to higher inference latency and memory consumption. As a result, balancing accuracy and reasoning efficiency has become essential for deploying reasoning LLMs in practical applications. Existing long-to-short (Long2Short) methods aim to reduce inference length but often sacrifice accuracy, revealing a need for an approach that maintains performance while lowering token costs. To address this efficiency-accuracy tradeoff, we propose TokenSqueeze, a novel Long2Short method that condenses reasoning paths while preserving performance and relying exclusively on self-generated data. First, to prevent performance degradation caused by excessive compression of reasoning depth, we propose to select self-generated samples whose reasoning depth is adaptively matched to the complexity of the problem. To further optimize the linguistic expression without altering the underlying reasoning paths, we introduce a distribution-aligned linguistic refinement method that enhances the clarity and conciseness of the reasoning path while preserving its logical integrity. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSqueeze in reducing token usage while maintaining accuracy. Notably, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned using our proposed method achieved a 50\% average token reduction while preserving accuracy on the MATH500 benchmark. TokenSqueeze exclusively utilizes the model's self-generated data, enabling efficient and high-fidelity reasoning without relying on manually curated short-answer datasets across diverse applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangyx1122/TokenSqueeze.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis posits that high-dimensional data typically resides on low-dimensional sub spaces. In this paper, we assume manifold hypothesis to investigate graph-based semi-supervised learning
  methods. In particular, we examine Laplace Learning in the Wasserstein space, extending the classical
  notion of graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to
  an infinite-dimensional setting. To achieve this, we prove variational convergence of a discrete graph p- Dirichlet energy to its continuum counterpart. In addition, we characterize the Laplace-Beltrami operator
  on asubmanifold of the Wasserstein space. Finally, we validate the proposed theoretical framework through
  numerical experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the consistency of our classification performance in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Traditional gradient boosting algorithms employ static tree structures with fixed splitting criteria that remain unchanged throughout training, limiting their ability to adapt to evolving gradient distributions and problem-specific characteristics across different learning stages. This work introduces MorphBoost, a new gradient boosting framework featuring self-organizing tree structures that dynamically morph their splitting behavior during training. The algorithm implements adaptive split functions that evolve based on accumulated gradient statistics and iteration-dependent learning pressures, enabling automatic adjustment to problem complexity. Key innovations include: (1) morphing split criterion combining gradient-based scores with information-theoretic metrics weighted by training progress; (2) automatic problem fingerprinting for intelligent parameter configuration across binary/multiclass/regression tasks; (3) vectorized tree prediction achieving significant computational speedups; (4) interaction-aware feature importance detecting multiplicative relationships; and (5) fast-mode optimization balancing speed and accuracy. Comprehensive benchmarking across 10 diverse datasets against competitive models (XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting, HistGradientBoosting, ensemble methods) demonstrates that MorphBoost achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming XGBoost by 0.84% on average. MorphBoost secured the overall winner position with 4/10 dataset wins (40% win rate) and 6/30 top-3 finishes (20%), while maintaining the lowest variance ({\sigma}=0.0948) and highest minimum accuracy across all models, revealing superior consistency and robustness. Performance analysis across difficulty levels shows competitive results on easy datasets while achieving notable improvements on advanced problems due to higher adaptation levels.

arXiv:2511.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have improved multivariate time series (MTS) classification and regression by capturing complex patterns, but their lack of transparency hinders decision-making. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer partial insights, yet often fall short of conveying the full decision space. Counterfactual Explanations (CE) provide a promising alternative, but current approaches typically prioritize either accuracy, proximity or sparsity -- rarely all -- limiting their practical value. To address this, we propose CONFETTI, a novel multi-objective CE method for MTS. CONFETTI identifies key MTS subsequences, locates a counterfactual target, and optimally modifies the time series to balance prediction confidence, proximity and sparsity. This method provides actionable insights with minimal changes, improving interpretability, and decision support. CONFETTI is evaluated on seven MTS datasets from the UEA archive, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains. CONFETTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CE methods in its optimization objectives, and in six other metrics from the literature, achieving $\geq10\%$ higher confidence while improving sparsity in $\geq40\%$.

<title>Computational Measurement of Political Positions: A Review of Text-Based Ideal Point Estimation Algorithms</title>

arXiv:2511.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the first systematic review of unsupervised and semi-supervised computational text-based ideal point estimation (CT-IPE) algorithms, methods designed to infer latent political positions from textual data. These algorithms are widely used in political science, communication, computational social science, and computer science to estimate ideological preferences from parliamentary speeches, party manifestos, and social media. Over the past two decades, their development has closely followed broader NLP trends -- beginning with word-frequency models and most recently turning to large language models (LLMs). While this trajectory has greatly expanded the methodological toolkit, it has also produced a fragmented field that lacks systematic comparison and clear guidance for applied use. To address this gap, we identified 25 CT-IPE algorithms through a systematic literature review and conducted a manual content analysis of their modeling assumptions and development contexts. To compare them meaningfully, we introduce a conceptual framework that distinguishes how algorithms generate, capture, and aggregate textual variance. On this basis, we identify four methodological families -- word-frequency, topic modeling, word embedding, and LLM-based approaches -- and critically assess their assumptions, interpretability, scalability, and limitations. Our review offers three contributions. First, it provides a structured synthesis of two decades of algorithm development, clarifying how diverse methods relate to one another. Second, it translates these insights into practical guidance for applied researchers, highlighting trade-offs in transparency, technical requirements, and validation strategies that shape algorithm choice. Third, it emphasizes that differences in estimation outcomes across algorithms are themselves informative, underscoring the need for systematic benchmarking.

Abstract: Real-world tasks and environments exhibit differences from the static datasets that large language models (LLMs) are typically evaluated on. Such tasks can involve sequential interaction, requiring coherent updating of beliefs in light of new evidence, and making appropriate decisions based on those beliefs. Predicting how LLMs will perform in such dynamic environments is important, but can be tricky to determine from measurements in static settings. In this work, we examine two critical components of LLM performance: the ability of LLMs to coherently update their beliefs, and the extent to which the actions they take are consistent with those beliefs. First, we find that LLMs are largely inconsistent in how they update their beliefs; models can exhibit up to a 30% average difference between the directly elicited posterior, and the correct update of their prior. Second, we find that LLMs also often take actions which are inconsistent with the beliefs they hold. On a betting market, for example, LLMs often do not even bet in the same direction as their internally held beliefs over the underlying outcomes. We also find they have moderate self-inconsistency in how they respond to challenges by users to given answers. Finally, we show that the above properties hold even for strong models that obtain high accuracy or that are well-calibrated on the tasks at hand. Our results highlight the difficulties of predicting LLM behavior in complex real-world settings.

Abstract: Multimodal Model Editing (MMED) aims to correct erroneous knowledge in multimodal models. Existing evaluation methods, adapted from textual model editing, overstate success by relying on low-similarity or random inputs, obscure overfitting. We propose a comprehensive locality evaluation framework, covering three key dimensions: random-image locality, no-image locality, and consistent-image locality, operationalized through seven distinct data types, enabling a detailed and structured analysis of multimodal edits. We introduce De-VQA, a dynamic evaluation for visual question answering, uncovering a phenomenon we term transient blindness, overfitting to edit-similar text while ignoring visuals. Token analysis shows edits disproportionately affect textual tokens. We propose locality-aware adversarial losses to balance cross-modal representations. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, reducing transient blindness and improving locality by 17% on average.

Abstract: Accurate protein structures are essential for understanding biological function, yet incorporating experimental data into protein generative models remains a major challenge. Most predictors of experimental observables are non-differentiable, making them incompatible with gradient-based conditional sampling. This is especially limiting in nuclear magnetic resonance, where rich data such as chemical shifts are hard to directly integrate into generative modeling. We introduce a framework for non-differentiable guidance of protein generative models, coupling a continuous diffusion-based generator with any black-box objective via a tailored genetic algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness across three modalities: pairwise distance constraints, nuclear Overhauser effect restraints, and for the first time chemical shifts. These results establish chemical shift guided structure generation as feasible, expose key weaknesses in current predictors, and showcase a general strategy for incorporating diverse experimental signals. Our work points toward automated, data-conditioned protein modeling beyond the limits of differentiability.

Abstract: We present reproducible, edge-aware baselines for ogbn-proteins in PyTorch Geometric (PyG). We study two system choices that dominate practice: (i) how 8-dimensional edge evidence is aggregated into node inputs, and (ii) how edges are used inside message passing. Our strongest baseline is GraphSAGE with sum-based edge-to-node features. We compare LayerNorm (LN), BatchNorm (BN), and a species-aware Conditional LayerNorm (CLN), and report compute cost (time, VRAM, parameters) together with accuracy (ROC-AUC) and decision quality. In our primary experimental setup (hidden size 512, 3 layers, 3 seeds), sum consistently beats mean and max; BN attains the best AUC, while CLN matches the AUC frontier with better thresholded F1. Finally, post-hoc per-label temperature scaling plus per-label thresholds substantially improves micro-F1 and expected calibration error (ECE) with negligible AUC change, and light label-correlation smoothing yields small additional gains. We release standardized artifacts and scripts used for all of the runs presented in the paper.

Abstract: GPU kernels are critical for ML performance but difficult to optimize across diverse accelerators. We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms.
  We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning is one of the state-of-the-art methods for producing near-optimal system controllers. However, deep RL algorithms train a deep neural network, that lacks transparency, which poses challenges when the controller has to meet regulations, or foster trust. To alleviate this, one could transfer the learned behaviour into a model that is human-readable by design using knowledge distilla- tion. Often this is done with a single model which mimics the original model on average but could struggle in more dynamic situations. A key challenge is that this simpler model should have the right balance be- tween flexibility and complexity or right balance between balance bias and accuracy. We propose a new model-agnostic method to divide the state space into regions where a simplified, human-understandable model can operate in. In this paper, we use Voronoi partitioning to find regions where linear models can achieve similar performance to the original con- troller. We evaluate our approach on a gridworld environment and a classic control task. We observe that our proposed distillation to locally- specialized linear models produces policies that are explainable and show that the distillation matches or even slightly outperforms the black-box policy they are distilled from.

Abstract: Supervised learning with tabular data presents unique challenges, including low data sizes, the absence of structural cues, and heterogeneous features spanning both categorical and continuous domains. Unlike vision and language tasks, where models can exploit inductive biases in the data, tabular data lacks inherent positional structure, hindering the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. While recent transformer-based models like TabTransformer, SAINT, and FT-Transformer (which we refer to as 3T) have shown promise on tabular data, they typically operate without leveraging structural cues such as positional encodings (PEs), as no prior structural information is usually available. In this work, we find both theoretically and empirically that structural cues, specifically PEs can be a useful tool to improve generalization performance for tabular transformers. We find that PEs impart the ability to reduce the effective rank (a form of intrinsic dimensionality) of the features, effectively simplifying the task by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, yielding improved generalization. To that end, we propose Tab-PET (PEs for Tabular Transformers), a graph-based framework for estimating and inculcating PEs into embeddings. Inspired by approaches that derive PEs from graph topology, we explore two paradigms for graph estimation: association-based and causality-based. We empirically demonstrate that graph-derived PEs significantly improve performance across 50 classification and regression datasets for 3T. Notably, association-based graphs consistently yield more stable and pronounced gains compared to causality-driven ones. Our work highlights an unexpected role of PEs in tabular transformers, revealing how they can be harnessed to improve generalization.

Abstract: Rock discontinuities critically govern the mechanical behavior and stability of rock masses. Their internal distributions remain largely unobservable and are typically inferred from surface-exposed discontinuities using generative prediction approaches. However, surface-exposed observations are inherently sparse, and existing generative prediction approaches either fail to capture the underlying complex distribution patterns or lack robustness under data-sparse conditions. Here, we proposed a simple yet robust approach for statistically accurate generative prediction of rock discontinuities by utilizing a tabular foundation model. By leveraging the powerful sample learning capability of the foundation model specifically designed for small data, our approach can effectively capture the underlying complex distribution patterns within limited measured discontinuities. Comparative experiments on ten datasets with diverse scales and distribution patterns of discontinuities demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness over conventional statistical models and deep generative approaches. This work advances quantitative characterization of rock mass structures, supporting safer and more reliable data-driven geotechnical design.

Abstract: Food analysis has become increasingly critical for health-related tasks such as personalized nutrition and chronic disease prevention. However, existing large multimodal models (LMMs) in food analysis suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks, requiring costly retraining from scratch. To address this, we propose a novel continual learning framework for multimodal food learning, integrating a Dual-LoRA architecture with Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay. We introduce two complementary low-rank adapters for each task: a specialized LoRA that learns task-specific knowledge with orthogonal constraints to previous tasks' subspaces, and a cooperative LoRA that consolidates shared knowledge across tasks via pseudo replay. To improve the reliability of replay data, our Quality-Enhanced Pseudo Replay strategy leverages self-consistency and semantic similarity to reduce hallucinations in generated samples. Experiments on the comprehensive Uni-Food dataset show superior performance in mitigating forgetting, representing the first effective continual learning approach for complex food tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in distributed healthcare, including consolidating specialized domain knowledge across institutions while maintaining privacy, reducing computational overhead, and preventing catastrophic forgetting during model updates.This paper presents a systematic evaluation of six parameter-space merging techniques applied to two architecturally compatible medical LLMs derived from the Mistral-7B base model. We introduce a novel hierarchical method that combines selective Optimal Transport (OT) alignment for attention layers with cosine similarity-weighted interpolation, designed to address permutation variance while minimizing computational overhead for edge deployment scenarios. Our study evaluates Task Arithmetic, Linear Averaging, DARE-TIES, DELLA, Breadcrumbs, and our Hierarchical approach across five medical benchmarks. Results demonstrate that architecturally compatible models benefit significantly from simple averaging methods, with Task Arithmetic achieving 45.80% accuracy on MedQA, outperforming complex pruning-based approaches. These findings offer critical insights for the deployment of distributed medical AI in resource-constrained IoT environments, where computational efficiency and model compatibility are paramount. Our work establishes that for architecturally compatible models, simple averaging provides a robust and computationally efficient baseline for knowledge consolidation, offering a pragmatic path forward for scalable medical AI systems.

Abstract: Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.

Abstract: Bayesian parameter inference for complex stochastic simulators is challenging due to intractable likelihood functions. Existing simulation-based inference methods often require large number of simulations and become costly to use in high-dimensional parameter spaces or in problems with partially uninformative outputs. We propose a new method for differentiable simulators that delivers accurate posterior inference with substantially reduced runtimes. Building on the Optimization Monte Carlo framework, our approach reformulates stochastic simulation as deterministic optimization problems. Gradient-based methods are then applied to efficiently navigate toward high-density posterior regions and avoid wasteful simulations in low-probability areas. A JAX-based implementation further enhances the performance through vectorization of key method components. Extensive experiments, including high-dimensional parameter spaces, uninformative outputs, multiple observations and multimodal posteriors show that our method consistently matches, and often exceeds, the accuracy of state-of-the-art approaches, while reducing the runtime by a substantial margin.

<title>PAST: A Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Time Series Imputation</title>

Abstract: Traffic time series imputation is crucial for the safety and reliability of intelligent transportation systems, while diverse types of missing data, including random, fiber, and block missing make the imputation task challenging. Existing models often focus on disentangling and separately modeling spatial and temporal patterns based on relationships between data points. However, these approaches struggle to adapt to the random missing positions, and fail to learn long-term and large-scale dependencies, which are essential in extensive missing conditions. In this paper, patterns are categorized into two types to handle various missing data conditions: primary patterns, which originate from internal relationships between data points, and auxiliary patterns, influenced by external factors like timestamps and node attributes. Accordingly, we propose the Primary-Auxiliary Spatio-Temporal network (PAST). It comprises a graph-integrated module (GIM) and a cross-gated module (CGM). GIM captures primary patterns via dynamic graphs with interval-aware dropout and multi-order convolutions, and CGM extracts auxiliary patterns through bidirectional gating on embedded external features. The two modules interact via shared hidden vectors and are trained under an ensemble self-supervised framework. Experiments on three datasets under 27 missing data conditions demonstrate that the imputation accuracy of PAST outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines by up to 26.2% in RMSE and 31.6% in MAE.

Abstract: Accurate short-range prediction of extreme air temperature events remains a fundamental challenge in operational climate-risk management. We present Multi-Modal Weather State Transition Model with Anomaly-Driven Recurrent Attention Network Plus (MMWSTM-ADRAN+), a dual-stream deep learning architecture that couples a regime-aware dynamics model with an anomaly-focused attention mechanism to forecast daily maximum temperature and its extremes. The first stream, MMWSTM, combines bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) units with a learnable Markov state transition matrix to capture synoptic-scale weather regime changes. The second stream, ADRAN, integrates bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs), multi-head self-attention, and a novel anomaly amplification layer to enhance sensitivity to low-probability signals. A lightweight attentive fusion gate adaptively determines the contribution of each stream to the final prediction. Model optimization employs a custom ExtremeWeatherLoss function that up-weights errors on the upper 5% and lower 5% of the temperature distribution, and a time-series data augmentation suite (jittering, scaling, time/magnitude warping) that effectively quadruples the training data

<title>Larger Datasets Can Be Repeated More: A Theoretical Analysis of Multi-Epoch Scaling in Linear Regression</title>

Abstract: While data scaling laws of large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined in the one-pass regime with massive corpora, their form under limited data and repeated epochs remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of how a common workaround, training for multiple epochs on the same dataset, reshapes the data scaling laws in linear regression. Concretely, we ask: to match the performance of training on a dataset of size $N$ for $K$ epochs, how much larger must a dataset be if the model is trained for only one pass? We quantify this using the \textit{effective reuse rate} of the data, $E(K, N)$, which we define as the multiplicative factor by which the dataset must grow under one-pass training to achieve the same test loss as $K$-epoch training. Our analysis precisely characterizes the scaling behavior of $E(K, N)$ for SGD in linear regression under either strong convexity or Zipf-distributed data: (1) When $K$ is small, we prove that $E(K, N) \approx K$, indicating that every new epoch yields a linear gain; (2) As $K$ increases, $E(K, N)$ plateaus at a problem-dependent value that grows with $N$ ($\Theta(\log N)$ for the strongly-convex case), implying that larger datasets can be repeated more times before the marginal benefit vanishes. These theoretical findings point out a neglected factor in a recent empirical study (Muennighoff et al. (2023)), which claimed that training LLMs for up to $4$ epochs results in negligible loss differences compared to using fresh data at each step, \textit{i.e.}, $E(K, N) \approx K$ for $K \le 4$ in our notation. Supported by further empirical validation with LLMs, our results reveal that the maximum $K$ value for which $E(K, N) \approx K$ in fact depends on the data size and distribution, and underscore the need to explicitly model both factors in future studies of scaling laws with data reuse.

<title>Discovering Operational Patterns Using Image-Based Convolutional Clustering and Composite Evaluation: A Case Study in Foundry Melting Processes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13444</link>

Abstract: Industrial process monitoring increasingly relies on sensor-generated time-series data, yet the lack of labels, high variability, and operational noise make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns using conventional methods. Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems.

Abstract: The pervasive integration of Artificial Intelligence models into contemporary mobile computing is notable across numerous use cases, from virtual assistants to advanced image processing. Optimizing the mobile user experience involves minimal latency and high responsiveness from deployed AI models with challenges from execution strategies that fully leverage real time constraints to the exploitation of heterogeneous hardware architecture. In this paper, we research and propose the optimal execution configurations for AI models on an Android system, focusing on two critical tasks: object detection (YOLO family) and image classification (ResNet). These configurations evaluate various model quantization schemes and the utilization of on device accelerators, specifically the GPU and NPU. Our core objective is to empirically determine the combination that achieves the best trade-off between minimal accuracy degradation and maximal inference speed-up.

<title>Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Spirometry for Early Detection of Right Heart Failure</title>

Abstract: Right heart failure (RHF) is a disease characterized by abnormalities in the structure or function of the right ventricle (RV), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: In the area of explainable artificial intelligence, Symbolic Regression (SR) has emerged as a promising approach by discovering interpretable mathematical expressions that fit data. However, SR faces two main challenges: most methods are evaluated on scientific datasets with well-understood relationships, limiting generalization, and SR primarily targets single-output regression, whereas many real-world problems involve multi-target outputs with interdependent variables. To address these issues, we propose multi-task regression GINN-LP (MTRGINN-LP), an interpretable neural network for multi-target symbolic regression. By integrating GINN-LP with a multi-task deep learning, the model combines a shared backbone including multiple power-term approximator blocks with task-specific output layers, capturing inter-target dependencies while preserving interpretability. We validate multi-task GINN-LP on practical multi-target applications, including energy efficiency prediction and sustainable agriculture. Experimental results demonstrate competitive predictive performance alongside high interpretability, effectively extending symbolic regression to broader real-world multi-output tasks.

Abstract: Since the 21st century, artificial intelligence has been leading a new round of industrial revolution. Under the training framework, the optimization algorithm aims to stably converge high-dimensional optimization to local and even global minima. Entering the era of large language models, although the scale of model parameters and data has increased, Adam remains the mainstream optimization algorithm. However, compared with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based optimization algorithms, Adam is more likely to converge to non-flat minima. To address this issue, the AdamX algorithm is proposed. Its core innovation lies in the proposition of a novel type of second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, which gradually weakens the learning step correction strength as training progresses, and degrades to SGD in the stable training period, thereby improving the stability of training in the stable period and possibly enhancing generalization ability. Experimental results show that our second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate is better than the current second-order moment estimation exponential decay rate, and AdamX can stably outperform Adam and its variants in terms of performance. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/mengzhu0308/AdamX.

<title>GREAT: Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations for Zero-Shot Environmental Prediction</title>

Abstract: Environmental modeling faces critical challenges in predicting ecosystem dynamics across unmonitored regions due to limited and geographically imbalanced observation data. This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios. This work provides a practical solution for environmental applications where comprehensive monitoring is infeasible.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has attracted growing interest with the rapid parallel advances in large-scale classical machine learning and quantum technologies. Similar to classical machine learning, QML models also face challenges arising from the scarcity of labeled data, particularly as their scale and complexity increase. Here, we introduce self-supervised pretraining of quantum representations that reduces reliance on labeled data by learning invariances from unlabeled examples. We implement this paradigm on a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer, encoding images as quantum states. In situ contrastive pretraining on hardware yields a representation that, when fine-tuned, classifies image families with higher mean test accuracy and lower run-to-run variability than models trained from random initialization. Performance improvement is especially significant in regimes with limited labeled training data. We show that the learned invariances generalize beyond the pretraining image samples. Unlike prior work, our pipeline derives similarity from measured quantum overlaps and executes all training and classification stages on hardware. These results establish a label-efficient route to quantum representation learning, with direct relevance to quantum-native datasets and a clear path to larger classical inputs.

Abstract: This paper presents Naga, a deep State Space Model (SSM) encoding approach inspired by structural concepts from Vedic mathematics. The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is a critical challenge in machine learning. While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{\"o}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, compared to state-of-the-art ``white box" models, in change point detection and time series clustering, providing insights into the uncertainties associated with decision-making throughout the process.

<title>Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Patch-wise Tumor Classification on High-Resolution Multimodal Images</title>

Abstract: Patch-wise multi-label classification provides an efficient alternative to full pixel-wise segmentation on high-resolution images, particularly when the objective is to determine the presence or absence of target objects within a patch rather than their precise spatial extent. This formulation substantially reduces annotation cost, simplifies training, and allows flexible patch sizing aligned with the desired level of decision granularity. In this work, we focus on a special case, patch-wise binary classification, applied to the detection of a single class of interest (tumor) on high-resolution multimodal nonlinear microscopy images. We show that, although this simplified formulation enables efficient model development, it can introduce spurious correlations between patch composition and labels: tumor patches tend to contain larger tissue regions, whereas non-tumor patches often consist mostly of background with small tissue areas. We further quantify the bias in model predictions caused by this spurious correlation, and propose to use a debiasing strategy to mitigate its effect. Specifically, we apply GERNE, a debiasing method that can be adapted to maximize worst-group accuracy (WGA). Our results show an improvement in WGA by approximately 7% compared to ERM for two different thresholds used to binarize the spurious feature. This enhancement boosts model performance on critical minority cases, such as tumor patches with small tissues and non-tumor patches with large tissues, and underscores the importance of spurious correlation-aware learning in patch-wise classification problems.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in Graph Neural Networks is fundamental to promoting trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning systems. In response, numerous fair graph learning methods have been proposed in recent years. However, most of them assume full access to demographic information, a requirement rarely met in practice due to privacy, legal, or regulatory restrictions. To this end, this paper introduces a novel fair graph learning framework that mitigates bias in graph learning under limited demographic information. Specifically, we propose a mechanism guided by partial demographic data to generate proxies for demographic information and design a strategy that enforces consistent node embeddings across demographic groups. In addition, we develop an adaptive confidence strategy that dynamically adjusts each node's contribution to fairness and utility based on prediction confidence. We further provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our framework, FairGLite, achieves provable upper bounds on group fairness metrics, offering formal guarantees for bias mitigation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and fair graph learning frameworks, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in both mitigating bias and maintaining model utility.

<title>Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection via Test-Time Calibration with Dual Dynamic Dictionaries</title>

Abstract: A key challenge in graph out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies in the absence of ground-truth OOD samples during training. Existing methods are typically optimized to capture features within the in-distribution (ID) data and calculate OOD scores, which often limits pre-trained models from representing distributional boundaries, leading to unreliable OOD detection. Moreover, the latent structure of graph data is often governed by multiple underlying factors, which remains less explored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time graph OOD detection method, termed BaCa, that calibrates OOD scores using dual dynamically updated dictionaries without requiring fine-tuning the pre-trained model. Specifically, BaCa estimates graphons and applies a mix-up strategy solely with test samples to generate diverse boundary-aware discriminative topologies, eliminating the need for exposing auxiliary datasets as outliers. We construct dual dynamic dictionaries via priority queues and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture latent ID and OOD representations, which are then utilized for boundary-aware OOD score calibration. To the best of our knowledge, extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that BaCa significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in OOD detection.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC), which aims to separate the multi-view data into distinct clusters in an unsupervised manner, is a fundamental yet challenging task. To enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios, this paper addresses a more challenging task: MVC under multi-source noises, including missing noise and observation noise. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Reliability-Aware Contrastive Deep Multi-View Clustering (RAC-DMVC), which constructs a reliability graph to guide robust representation learning under noisy environments. Specifically, to address observation noise, we introduce a cross-view reconstruction to enhances robustness at the data level, and a reliability-aware noise contrastive learning to mitigates bias in positive and negative pairs selection caused by noisy representations. To handle missing noise, we design a dual-attention imputation to capture shared information across views while preserving view-specific features. In addition, a self-supervised cluster distillation module further refines the learned representations and improves the clustering performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that RAC-DMVC outperforms SOTA methods on multiple evaluation metrics and maintains excellent performance under varying ratios of noise.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has moved the frontier from puzzle-solving to science-grade reasoning-the kind needed to tackle problems whose answers must stand against nature, not merely fit a rubric. Physics is the sharpest test of this shift, which binds symbols to reality in a fundamental way, serving as the cornerstone of most modern technologies. In this work, we manage to advance physics research by developing large language models with exceptional physics reasoning capabilities, especially excel at solving Olympiad-level physics problems. We introduce P1, a family of open-source physics reasoning models trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL). Among them, P1-235B-A22B is the first open-source model with Gold-medal performance at the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO 2025), and wins 12 gold medals out of 13 international/regional physics competitions in 2024/2025. P1-30B-A3B also surpasses almost all other open-source models on IPhO 2025, getting a silver medal.

<title>Batch Acquisition Function Evaluations and Decouple Optimizer Updates for Faster Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) efficiently finds high-performing parameters by maximizing an acquisition function, which models the promise of parameters. A major computational bottleneck arises in acquisition function optimization, where multi-start optimization (MSO) with quasi-Newton (QN) methods is required due to the non-convexity of the acquisition function. BoTorch, a widely used BO library, currently optimizes the summed acquisition function over multiple points, leading to the speedup of MSO owing to PyTorch batching. Nevertheless, this paper empirically demonstrates the suboptimality of this approach in terms of off-diagonal approximation errors in the inverse Hessian of a QN method, slowing down its convergence. To address this problem, we propose to decouple QN updates using a coroutine while batching the acquisition function calls. Our approach not only yields the theoretically identical convergence to the sequential MSO but also drastically reduces the wall-clock time compared to the previous approaches.

Abstract: Paediatric kidney disease varies widely in its presentation and progression, which calls for continuous monitoring of renal function. Using electronic health records collected between 2019 and 2025 at Great Ormond Street Hospital, a leading UK paediatric hospital, we explored a temporal modelling approach that integrates longitudinal laboratory sequences with demographic information. A recurrent neural model trained on these data was used to predict whether a child would record an abnormal serum creatinine value within the following thirty days. Framed as a pilot study, this work provides an initial demonstration that simple temporal representations can capture useful patterns in routine paediatric data and lays the groundwork for future multimodal extensions using additional clinical signals and more detailed renal outcomes.

<title>Data Value in the Age of Scaling: Understanding LLM Scaling Dynamics Under Real-Synthetic Data Mixtures</title>

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) is fueled by the growing reliance on datasets that blend real and synthetic data. While synthetic data offers scalability and cost-efficiency, it often introduces systematic distributional discrepancies, particularly underrepresenting long-tail knowledge due to truncation effects from data generation mechanisms like top-p sampling, temperature scaling, and finite sampling. These discrepancies pose fundamental challenges in characterizing and evaluating the utility of mixed real-synthetic datasets. In this paper, we identify a three-phase scaling behavior characterized by two breakpoints that reflect transitions in model behavior across learning head and tail knowledge. We further derive an LLM generalization bound designed for real and synthetic mixtures, revealing several key factors that govern their generalization performance. Building on our theoretical findings, we propose an effective yet efficient data valuation method that scales to large-scale datasets. Comprehensive experiments across four tasks, including image classification, sentiment classification, instruction following, and complex reasoning, demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in data valuation with significantly low computational cost.

Abstract: We present FuseSampleAgg, a CUDA operator that fuses neighbor sampling and mean aggregation into a single pass for one and two hop GraphSAGE. By eliminating block materialization and extra kernel launches, FuseSampleAgg reduces memory traffic and overhead while preserving GraphSAGE mean semantics via saved index replay. Across the Reddit, ogbn-arxiv, and ogbn-products benchmarks (batch size 1024, automatic mixed precision enabled), we observe step time speedups up to 51x on ogbn-products, about 4x on Reddit with fanouts 10-10 and 15-10, and about 3.3x on ogbn-arxiv at larger fanouts, with peak GPU memory reductions up to 100x, 36x, and about 3.5x, respectively. The operator is deterministic, integrates with standard PyTorch optimizers, and ships with scripts that reproduce all tables and figures from CSV logs. Code and scripts are available at https://github.com/SV25-22/FuseSampleAgg.

Abstract: Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part responsible for the task. These circuits often contain neurons and residual channels that correspond to natural concepts, with a small number of straightforwardly interpretable connections between them. We study how these models scale and find that making weights sparser trades off capability for interpretability, and scaling model size improves the capability-interpretability frontier. However, scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge. In addition to training weight-sparse models de novo, we show preliminary results suggesting our method can also be adapted to explain existing dense models. Our work produces circuits that achieve an unprecedented level of human understandability and validates them with considerable rigor.

<title>Tuning for Two Adversaries: Enhancing the Robustness Against Transfer and Query-Based Attacks using Hyperparameter Tuning</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first detailed analysis of how optimization hyperparameters -- such as learning rate, weight decay, momentum, and batch size -- influence robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Supported by theory and experiments, our study spans a variety of practical deployment settings, including centralized training, ensemble learning, and distributed training. We uncover a striking dichotomy: for transfer-based attacks, decreasing the learning rate significantly enhances robustness by up to $64\%$. In contrast, for query-based attacks, increasing the learning rate consistently leads to improved robustness by up to $28\%$ across various settings and data distributions. Leveraging these findings, we explore -- for the first time -- the optimization hyperparameter design space to jointly enhance robustness against both transfer-based and query-based attacks. Our results reveal that distributed models benefit the most from hyperparameter tuning, achieving a remarkable tradeoff by simultaneously mitigating both attack types more effectively than other training setups.

Abstract: Modern scientific simulations, observations, and large-scale experiments generate data at volumes that often exceed the limits of storage, processing, and analysis. This challenge drives the development of data reduction methods that efficiently manage massive datasets while preserving essential physical features and quantities of interest. In many scientific workflows, it is also crucial to enable data recovery from compressed representations - a task known as super-resolution - with guarantees on the preservation of key physical characteristics. A notable example is checkpointing and restarting, which is essential for long-running simulations to recover from failures, resume after interruptions, or examine intermediate results. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for scientific data compression and super-resolution, grounded in recent advances in learning exponential families. Our method preserves and quantifies uncertainty in physical quantities of interest and supports flexible trade-offs between compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity.

arXiv:2511.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases.

Abstract: In this study, we tackle the challenging task of predicting secondary structures from protein primary sequences, a pivotal initial stride towards predicting tertiary structures, while yielding crucial insights into protein activity, relationships, and functions. Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.

<title>Efficient Calibration for Decision Making</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decision-theoretic characterization of perfect calibration is that an agent seeking to minimize a proper loss in expectation cannot improve their outcome by post-processing a perfectly calibrated predictor. Hu and Wu (FOCS'24) use this to define an approximate calibration measure called calibration decision loss ($\mathsf{CDL}$), which measures the maximal improvement achievable by any post-processing over any proper loss. Unfortunately, $\mathsf{CDL}$ turns out to be intractable to even weakly approximate in the offline setting, given black-box access to the predictions and labels.
  We suggest circumventing this by restricting attention to structured families of post-processing functions $K$. We define the calibration decision loss relative to $K$, denoted $\mathsf{CDL}_K$ where we consider all proper losses but restrict post-processings to a structured family $K$. We develop a comprehensive theory of when $\mathsf{CDL}_K$ is information-theoretically and computationally tractable, and use it to prove both upper and lower bounds for natural classes $K$. In addition to introducing new definitions and algorithmic techniques to the theory of calibration for decision making, our results give rigorous guarantees for some widely used recalibration procedures in machine learning.

<title>Learning stochasticity: a nonparametric framework for intrinsic noise estimation</title>

Abstract: Understanding the principles that govern dynamical systems is a central challenge across many scientific domains, including biology and ecology. Incomplete knowledge of nonlinear interactions and stochastic effects often renders bottom-up modeling approaches ineffective, motivating the development of methods that can discover governing equations directly from data. In such contexts, parametric models often struggle without strong prior knowledge, especially when estimating intrinsic noise. Nonetheless, incorporating stochastic effects is often essential for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways. To address these challenges, we introduce Trine (Three-phase Regression for INtrinsic noisE), a nonparametric, kernel-based framework that infers state-dependent intrinsic noise from time-series data. Trine features a three-stage algorithm that com- bines analytically solvable subproblems with a structured kernel architecture that captures both abrupt noise-driven fluctuations and smooth, state-dependent changes in variance. We validate Trine on biological and ecological systems, demonstrating its ability to uncover hidden dynamics without relying on predefined parametric assumptions. Across several benchmark problems, Trine achieves performance comparable to that of an oracle. Biologically, this oracle can be viewed as an idealized observer capable of directly tracking the random fluctuations in molecular concentrations or reaction events within a cell. The Trine framework thus opens new avenues for understanding how intrinsic noise affects the behavior of complex systems.

Abstract: Travel mode identification (TMI) from GPS trajectories is critical for urban intelligence, but is hampered by the high cost of annotation, leading to severe label scarcity. Prevailing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are ill-suited for this task, as they suffer from catastrophic confirmation bias and ignore the intrinsic data manifold. We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical core with foundational SSL Support. The core exploits the data manifold via graph regularization, prototypical anchoring, and a novel, margin-aware pseudo-labeling strategy to actively reject noise. This core is supported and stabilized by foundational contrastive and teacher-student consistency losses, ensuring high-quality representations and robust optimization. ST-ProC outperforms all baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating its efficacy in real-world sparse-label settings, with a performance boost of 21.5% over state-of-the-art methods like FixMatch.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning on high-dimensional RNA-seq data can reveal molecular subtypes beyond standard labels. We combine an autoencoder-based representation with clustering and stability analysis to search for rare but reproducible genomic subtypes. On the UCI "Gene Expression Cancer RNA-Seq" dataset (801 samples, 20,531 genes; BRCA, COAD, KIRC, LUAD, PRAD), a pan-cancer analysis shows clusters aligning almost perfectly with tissue of origin (Cramer's V = 0.887), serving as a negative control. We therefore reframe the problem within KIRC (n = 146): we select the top 2,000 highly variable genes, standardize them, train a feed-forward autoencoder (128-dimensional latent space), and run k-means for k = 2-10. While global indices favor small k, scanning k with a pre-specified discovery rule (rare < 10 percent and stable with Jaccard >= 0.60 across 20 seeds after Hungarian alignment) yields a simple solution at k = 5 (silhouette = 0.129, DBI = 2.045) with a rare cluster C0 (6.85 percent of patients) that is highly stable (Jaccard = 0.787). Cluster-vs-rest differential expression (Welch's t-test, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR) identifies coherent markers. Overall, pan-cancer clustering is dominated by tissue of origin, whereas a stability-aware within-cancer approach reveals a rare, reproducible KIRC subtype.

Abstract: As climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of extreme events such as wildfires, the need for accurate, explainable, and actionable forecasting becomes increasingly urgent. While artificial intelligence (AI) models have shown promise in predicting such events, their adoption in real-world decision-making remains limited due to their black-box nature, which limits trust, explainability, and operational readiness. This paper investigates the role of explainable AI (XAI) in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and actionable insight for extreme event forecasting. Using wildfire prediction as a case study, we evaluate various AI models and employ SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to uncover key features, decision pathways, and potential biases in model behavior. Our analysis demonstrates how XAI not only clarifies model reasoning but also supports critical decision-making by domain experts and response teams. In addition, we provide supporting visualizations that enhance the interpretability of XAI outputs by contextualizing feature importance and temporal patterns in seasonality and geospatial characteristics. This approach enhances the usability of AI explanations for practitioners and policymakers. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable, accessible, and trustworthy, essential for effective use in disaster preparedness, risk mitigation, and climate resilience planning.

Abstract: Recent research has attempted to associate preference optimization (PO) performance with the underlying preference datasets. In this work, our observation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and dispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match the desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between higher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this, we propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the highest DCRM. Empirically, in various settings, our method produces training datasets that can further improve models' performance on AlpacaEval, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard over the existing training sets.

Abstract: Machine learning models are used for pattern recognition analysis of big data, without direct human intervention. The task of unsupervised learning is to find the probability distribution that would best describe the available data, and then use it to make predictions for observables of interest. Classical models generally fit the data to Boltzmann distribution of Hamiltonians with a large number of tunable parameters. Quantum extensions of these models replace classical probability distributions with quantum density matrices. An advantage can be obtained only when features of density matrices that are absent in classical probability distributions are exploited. Such situations depend on the input data as well as the targeted observables. Explicit examples are discussed that bring out the constraints limiting possible quantum advantage. The problem-dependent extent of quantum advantage has implications for both data analysis and sensing applications.

Abstract: In human-device coexistence systems, collaborations among devices are determined by not only physical attributes such as network topology but also social attributes among human users. Consequently, trust evaluation of potential collaborators based on these multifaceted attributes becomes critical for ensuring the eventual outcome. However, due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of physical and social attributes, efficiently integrating them for accurate trust evaluation remains challenging. To overcome this difficulty, a canonical correlation analysis-enhanced hypergraph self-supervised learning (HSLCCA) method is proposed in this research. First, by treating all attributes as relationships among connected devices, a relationship hypergraph is constructed to comprehensively capture inter-device relationships across three dimensions: spatial attribute-related, device attribute-related, and social attribute-related. Next, a self-supervised learning framework is developed to integrate these multi-dimensional relationships and generate device embeddings enriched with relational semantics. In this learning framework, the relationship hypergraph is augmented into two distinct views to enhance semantic information. A parameter-sharing hypergraph neural network is then utilized to learn device embeddings from both views. To further enhance embedding quality, a CCA approach is applied, allowing the comparison of data between the two views. Finally, the trustworthiness of devices is calculated based on the learned device embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSLCCA method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithm in effectively identifying trusted devices.

Abstract: While NVIDIA remains the dominant provider of AI accelerators within cloud data center, emerging vendors such as AMD, Intel, Mac, and Huawei offer cost-effective alternatives with claims of compatibility and performance. This paper presents the first empirical study investigating divergence in machine learning model across heterogeneous AI accelerators. Utilizing an automated pipeline, we synthesize over 100,000 variant models derived from 4,000 real-world models and execute them across five different enterprise-grade accelerators. Our findings suggest that newer AI platforms from Mac and Huawei support at least 17\% fewer operators than NVIDIA. These platforms also exhibit a higher rate of output discrepancies (exceeding 5\%), which stem from differences in operator implementations, handling of exceptional numerical values, and instruction scheduling. They are also more susceptible to failures during model compilation-based acceleration, and in some cases, the compiled models produce outputs that differ noticeably from those generated using the standard execution mode. In addition, we identify 7 implementation flaws in PyTorch and 40 platform-specific issues across vendors. These results underscore the challenges of achieving consistent machine learning behavior in an increasingly diverse hardware ecosystem.

Abstract: We introduce a quantitative framework for separating skill and chance in games by modeling them as complementary sources of control over stochastic decision trees. We define the Skill-Luck Index S(G) in [-1, 1] by decomposing game outcomes into skill leverage K and luck leverage L. Applying this to 30 games reveals a continuum from pure chance (coin toss, S = -1) through mixed domains such as backgammon (S = 0, Sigma = 1.20) to pure skill (chess, S = +1, Sigma = 0). Poker exhibits moderate skill dominance (S = 0.33) with K = 0.40 +/- 0.03 and Sigma = 0.80. We further introduce volatility Sigma to quantify outcome uncertainty over successive turns. The framework extends to general stochastic decision systems, enabling principled comparisons of player influence, game balance, and predictive stability, with applications to game design, AI evaluation, and risk assessment.

Abstract: Buried pipelines transporting oil and gas across geohazard-prone regions are exposed to potential ground movement, leading to the risk of significant strain demand and structural failure. Reliability analysis, which determines the probability of failure after accounting for pertinent uncertainties, is essential for ensuring the safety of pipeline systems. However, traditional reliability analysis methods involving computationally intensive numerical models, such as finite element simulations of pipeline subjected to ground movement, have limited applications; this is partly because stochastic sampling approaches require repeated simulations over a large number of samples for the uncertain variables when estimating low probabilities. This study introduces Physics-Informed Neural Network for Reliability Analysis (PINN-RA) for buried pipelines subjected to ground movement, which integrates PINN-based surrogate model with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) to achieve efficient reliability assessment. To enable its application under uncertain variables associated with soil properties and ground movement, the PINN-based surrogate model is extended to solve a parametric differential equation system, namely the governing equation of pipelines embedded in soil with different properties. The findings demonstrate that PINN-RA significantly reduces the computational effort required and thus accelerates reliability analysis. By eliminating the need for repetitive numerical evaluations of pipeline subjected to permanent ground movement, the proposed approach provides an efficient and scalable tool for pipeline reliability assessment, enabling rapid decision-making in geohazard-prone regions.

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is a sustainable method of monitoring wildlife and environments that leads to the generation of large datasets and, currently, a processing backlog. Academic research into automating this process is focused on the application of resource intensive convolutional neural networks which require large pre-labelled datasets for training and lack flexibility in application. We present a viable alternative relevant in both wild and captive settings; a transparent, lightweight and fast-to-train associative memory AI model with Hopfield neural network (HNN) architecture. Adapted from a model developed to detect bat echolocation calls, this model monitors captive endangered black-and-white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata vocalisations. Lemur social calls of interest when monitoring welfare are stored in the HNN in order to detect other call instances across the larger acoustic dataset. We make significant model improvements by storing an additional signal caused by movement and achieve an overall accuracy of 0.94. The model can perform $340$ classifications per second, processing over 5.5 hours of audio data per minute, on a standard laptop running other applications. It has broad applicability and trains in milliseconds. Our lightweight solution reduces data-to-insight turnaround times and can accelerate decision making in both captive and wild settings.

<title>Hierarchical Federated Graph Attention Networks for Scalable and Resilient UAV Collision Avoidance</title>

Abstract: The real-time performance, adversarial resiliency, and privacy preservation are the most important metrics that need to be balanced to practice collision avoidance in large-scale multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems. Current frameworks tend to prescribe monolithic solutions that are not only prohibitively computationally complex with a scaling cost of $O(n^2)$ but simply do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance. The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $<10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol. We have proposed an adaptive differential privacy mechanism, wherein the noise level $(\epsilon \in [0.1, 1.0])$ is dynamically reduced based on an evaluation of the measured real-time threat that in turn maximized the privacy-utility tradeoff. Through the use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based lightweight audit logging instead of heavyweight blockchain consensus, the median cost of getting a $95^{th}$ percentile decision within 50ms is observed across all tested swarm sizes. This architecture provides a scalable scenario of 500 UAVs with a collision rate of $< 2.0\%$ and the Byzantine fault tolerance of $f < n/3$.

Abstract: Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) and their variants have significantly influenced real-world applications. Deploying smaller models (i.e., small language models (SLMs)) on edge devices offers additional advantages, such as reduced latency and independence from network connectivity. However, edge devices' limited computing resources and constrained energy budgets challenge efficient deployment. This study evaluates the power efficiency of five representative SLMs - Llama 3.2, Phi-3 Mini, TinyLlama, and Gemma 2 on Raspberry Pi 5, Jetson Nano, and Jetson Orin Nano (CPU and GPU configurations). Results show that Jetson Orin Nano with GPU acceleration achieves the highest energy-to-performance ratio, significantly outperforming CPU-based setups. Llama 3.2 provides the best balance of accuracy and power efficiency, while TinyLlama is well-suited for low-power environments at the cost of reduced accuracy. In contrast, Phi-3 Mini consumes the most energy despite its high accuracy. In addition, GPU acceleration, memory bandwidth, and model architecture are key in optimizing inference energy efficiency. Our empirical analysis offers practical insights for AI, smart systems, and mobile ad-hoc platforms to leverage tradeoffs from accuracy, inference latency, and power efficiency in energy-constrained environments.

Abstract: Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.

Abstract: The tactile sensation of clothing is critical to wearer comfort. To reveal physical properties that make clothing comfortable, systematic collection of tactile data during sliding motion is required. We propose a robotic arm-based system for collecting tactile data from intact garments. The system performs stroking measurements with a simulated fingertip while precisely controlling speed and direction, enabling creation of motion-labeled, multimodal tactile databases. Machine learning evaluation showed that including motion-related parameters improved identification accuracy for audio and acceleration data, demonstrating the efficacy of motion-related labels for characterizing clothing tactile sensation. This system provides a scalable, non-destructive method for capturing tactile data of clothing, contributing to future studies on fabric perception and reproduction.

Abstract: Speculative backpropagation has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate the training of neural networks by overlapping the forward and backward passes. Leveraging speculative weight updates when error gradients fall within a specific threshold reduces training time without substantially compromising accuracy. In this work, we implement speculative backpropagation on the MNIST dataset using OpenMP as the parallel programming platform. OpenMP's multi-threading capabilities enable simultaneous execution of forward and speculative backpropagation steps, significantly improving training speed. The application is planned for synthesis on a state-of-the-art FPGA to demonstrate its potential for hardware acceleration. Our CPU-based experimental results demonstrate that speculative backpropagation achieves a maximum speedup of 24% in execution time when using a threshold of 0.25, and accuracy remaining within 3-4% of the baseline across various epochs. Additionally, when comparing individual step execution time, speculative backpropagation yields a maximum speedup of 35% over the baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness of overlapping forward and backward passes.

<title>The Environmental Impact of Ensemble Techniques in Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Ensemble techniques in recommender systems have demonstrated accuracy improvements of 10-30%, yet their environmental impact remains unmeasured. While deep learning recommendation algorithms can generate up to 3,297 kg CO2 per paper, ensemble methods have not been sufficiently evaluated for energy consumption. This thesis investigates how ensemble techniques influence environmental impact compared to single optimized models.
  We conducted 93 experiments across two frameworks (Surprise for rating prediction, LensKit for ranking) on four datasets spanning 100,000 to 7.8 million interactions. We evaluated four ensemble strategies (Average, Weighted, Stacking/Rank Fusion, Top Performers) against simple baselines and optimized single models, measuring energy consumption with a smart plug.
  Results revealed a non-linear accuracy-energy relationship. Ensemble methods achieved 0.3-5.7% accuracy improvements while consuming 19-2,549% more energy depending on dataset size and strategy. The Top Performers ensemble showed best efficiency: 0.96% RMSE improvement with 18.8% energy overhead on MovieLens-1M, and 5.7% NDCG improvement with 103% overhead on MovieLens-100K. Exhaustive averaging strategies consumed 88-270% more energy for comparable gains. On the largest dataset (Anime, 7.8M interactions), the Surprise ensemble consumed 2,005% more energy (0.21 Wh vs. 0.01 Wh) for 1.2% accuracy improvement, producing 53.8 mg CO2 versus 2.6 mg CO2 for the single model.
  This research provides one of the first systematic measurements of energy and carbon footprint for ensemble recommender systems, demonstrates that selective strategies offer superior efficiency over exhaustive averaging, and identifies scalability limitations at industrial scale. These findings enable informed decisions about sustainable algorithm selection in recommender systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown strong potential as rerankers to enhance the overall performance of RAG systems. However, existing reranking paradigms are constrained by a core theoretical and practical dilemma: Pointwise methods, while simple and highly flexible, evaluate documents independently, making them prone to the Ranking Myopia Trap, overlooking the relative importance between documents. In contrast, Listwise methods can perceive the global ranking context, but suffer from inherent List Rigidity, leading to severe scalability and flexibility issues when handling large candidate sets. To address these challenges, we propose Groupwise, a novel reranking paradigm. In this approach, the query and a group of candidate documents are jointly fed into the model, which performs within-group comparisons to assign individual relevance scores to each document. This design retains the flexibility of Pointwise methods while enabling the comparative capability of Listwise methods. We further adopt GRPO for model training, equipped with a heterogeneous reward function that integrates ranking metrics with a distributional reward aimed at aligning score distributions across groups. To overcome the bottleneck caused by the scarcity of high quality labeled data, we further propose an innovative pipeline for synthesizing high quality retrieval and ranking data. The resulting data can be leveraged not only for training the reranker but also for training the retriever. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach. On two reasoning intensive retrieval benchmarks, BRIGHT and R2MED.

Abstract: The surge in intelligent applications driven by large language models (LLMs) has made it increasingly difficult for bandwidth-limited cloud servers to process extensive LLM workloads in real time without compromising user data privacy. To solve these problems, recent research has focused on constructing cloud-edge consortia that integrate server-based LLM with small language models (SLMs) on mobile edge devices. Furthermore, designing collaborative training mechanisms within such consortia to enhance inference performance has emerged as a promising research direction. However, the cross-domain deployment of SLMs, coupled with structural heterogeneity in SLMs architectures, poses significant challenges to enhancing model performance. To this end, we propose Co-PLMs, a novel co-tuning framework for collaborative training of large and small language models, which integrates the process of structure-agnostic mutual learning to realize knowledge exchange between the heterogeneous language models. This framework employs distilled proxy models (DPMs) as bridges to enable collaborative training between the heterogeneous server-based LLM and on-device SLMs, while preserving the domain-specific insights of each device. The experimental results show that Co-PLMs outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving average increases of 5.38% in Rouge-L and 4.88% in EM.

Abstract: Estimating the probabilistic Worst-Case Execution Time (pWCET) is essential for ensuring the timing correctness of real-time applications, such as in robot IoT systems and autonomous driving systems. While methods based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) can provide tight bounds, they suffer from model uncertainty due to the need to decide where the upper tail of the distribution begins. Conversely, inequality-based approaches avoid this issue but can yield pessimistic results for heavy-tailed distributions. This paper proposes a method to reduce such pessimism by incorporating saturating functions (arctangent and hyperbolic tangent) into Chebyshev's inequality, which mitigates the influence of large outliers while preserving mathematical soundness. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world data from the Autoware autonomous driving stack demonstrate that the proposed method achieves safe and tighter bounds for such distributions.

Abstract: Generative vision-language models like Stable Diffusion demonstrate remarkable capabilities in creative media synthesis, but they also pose substantial risks of producing unsafe, offensive, or culturally inappropriate content when prompted adversarially. Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed under the Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized.
  We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.

Abstract: Device-to-device variability in experimental noise critically impacts reproducibility, especially in automated, high-throughput systems like additive manufacturing farms. While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability. Overall, this framework establishes a paradigm for precision- and resource-aware optimization in scalable, automated experimental platforms.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is fundamental to chemical engineering applications such as solvent screening. We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases. The framework reduces deployment costs by over 70% compared to full fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for molecular property prediction while elucidating the task-adaptive nature of self-consistency mechanisms.

Abstract: Generating complex, logically-sound SPARQL queries for multi-hop questions remains a critical bottleneck for Knowledge Graph Question Answering, as the brittle nature of one-shot generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) hinders reliable interaction with structured data. Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs.

Abstract: Benchmarks such as ARC, Raven-inspired tests, and the Blackbird Task are widely used to evaluate the intelligence of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the concept of intelligence remains elusive- lacking a stable definition and failing to predict performance on practical tasks such as question answering, summarization, or coding. Optimizing for such benchmarks risks misaligning evaluation with real-world utility. Our perspective is that evaluation should be grounded in generality rather than abstract notions of intelligence. We identify three assumptions that often underpin intelligence-focused evaluation: generality, stability, and realism. Through conceptual and formal analysis, we show that only generality withstands conceptual and empirical scrutiny. Intelligence is not what enables generality; generality is best understood as a multitask learning problem that directly links evaluation to measurable performance breadth and reliability. This perspective reframes how progress in AI should be assessed and proposes generality as a more stable foundation for evaluating capability across diverse and evolving tasks.

Abstract: Systematics contaminate observables, leading to distribution shifts relative to theoretically simulated signals-posing a major challenge for using pre-trained models to label such observables. Since systematics are often poorly understood and difficult to model, removing them directly and entirely may not be feasible. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that aligns learned features between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by optimizing a feature-alignment loss on the representations extracted from a pre-trained ID model. We first experimentally validate the method on the MNIST dataset using possible alignment losses, including mean squared error and optimal transport, and subsequently apply it to large-scale maps of neutral hydrogen. Our results show that optimal transport is particularly effective at aligning OOD features when parity between ID and OOD samples is unknown, even with limited data-mimicking real-world conditions in extracting information from large-scale surveys. Our code is available at https://github.com/sultan-hassan/feature-alignment-for-OOD-generalization.

<title>FreDN: Spectral Disentanglement for Time Series Forecasting via Learnable Frequency Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential in a wide range of real world applications. Recently, frequency-domain methods have attracted increasing interest for their ability to capture global dependencies. However, when applied to non-stationary time series, these methods encounter the $\textit{spectral entanglement}$ and the computational burden of complex-valued learning. The $\textit{spectral entanglement}$ refers to the overlap of trends, periodicities, and noise across the spectrum due to $\textit{spectral leakage}$ and the presence of non-stationarity. However, existing decompositions are not suited to resolving spectral entanglement. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Network (FreDN), which introduces a learnable Frequency Disentangler module to separate trend and periodic components directly in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we propose a theoretically supported ReIm Block to reduce the complexity of complex-valued operations while maintaining performance. We also re-examine the frequency-domain loss function and provide new theoretical insights into its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on seven long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that FreDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10\%. Furthermore, compared with standard complex-valued architectures, our real-imaginary shared-parameter design reduces the parameter count and computational cost by at least 50\%.

Abstract: We consider a discrete-time formulation for a class of high-dimensional stochastic joint replenishment problems. First, we approximate the problem by a continuous-time impulse control problem. Exploiting connections among the impulse control problem, backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with jumps, and the stochastic target problem, we develop a novel, simulation-based computational method that relies on deep neural networks to solve the impulse control problem. Based on that solution, we propose an implementable inventory control policy for the original (discrete-time) stochastic joint replenishment problem, and test it against the best available benchmarks in a series of test problems. For the problems studied thus far, our method matches or beats the best benchmark we could find, and it is computationally feasible up to at least 50 dimensions -- that is, 50 stock-keeping units (SKUs).

<title>TopoPerception: A Shortcut-Free Evaluation of Global Visual Perception in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically align visual features from an encoder with a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). However, this makes the visual perception module a bottleneck, which constrains the overall capabilities of LVLMs. Conventional evaluation benchmarks, while rich in visual semantics, often contain unavoidable local shortcuts that can lead to an overestimation of models' perceptual abilities. Here, we introduce TopoPerception, a benchmark that leverages topological properties to rigorously evaluate the global visual perception capabilities of LVLMs across various granularities. Since topology depends on the global structure of an image and is invariant to local features, TopoPerception enables a shortcut-free assessment of global perception, fundamentally distinguishing it from semantically rich tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on TopoPerception and find that even at the coarsest perceptual granularity, all models perform no better than random chance, indicating a profound inability to perceive global visual features. Notably, a consistent trend emerge within model families: more powerful models with stronger reasoning capabilities exhibit lower accuracy. This suggests that merely scaling up models is insufficient to address this deficit and may even exacerbate it. Progress may require new training paradigms or architectures. TopoPerception not only exposes a critical bottleneck in current LVLMs but also offers a lens and direction for improving their global visual perception. The data and code are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wenhao-Zhou/TopoPerception.

<title>MP-GFormer: A 3D-Geometry-Aware Dynamic Graph Transformer Approach for Machining Process Planning</title>

Abstract: Machining process planning (MP) is inherently complex due to structural and geometrical dependencies among part features and machining operations. A key challenge lies in capturing dynamic interdependencies that evolve with distinct part geometries as operations are performed. Machine learning has been applied to address challenges in MP, such as operation selection and machining sequence prediction. Dynamic graph learning (DGL) has been widely used to model dynamic systems, thanks to its ability to integrate spatio-temporal relationships. However, in MP, while existing DGL approaches can capture these dependencies, they fail to incorporate three-dimensional (3D) geometric information of parts and thus lack domain awareness in predicting machining operation sequences. To address this limitation, we propose MP-GFormer, a 3D-geometry-aware dynamic graph transformer that integrates evolving 3D geometric representations into DGL through an attention mechanism to predict machining operation sequences. Our approach leverages StereoLithography surface meshes representing the 3D geometry of a part after each machining operation, with the boundary representation method used for the initial 3D designs. We evaluate MP-GFormer on a synthesized dataset and demonstrate that the method achieves improvements of 24\% and 36\% in accuracy for main and sub-operation predictions, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>Modeling X-ray photon pile-up with a normalizing flow</title>

Abstract: The dynamic range of imaging detectors flown on-board X-ray observatories often only covers a limited flux range of extrasolar X-ray sources. The analysis of bright X-ray sources is complicated by so-called pile-up, which results from high incident photon flux. This nonlinear effect distorts the measured spectrum, resulting in biases in the inferred physical parameters, and can even lead to a complete signal loss in extreme cases. Piled-up data are commonly discarded due to resulting intractability of the likelihood. As a result, a large number of archival observations remain underexplored. We present a machine learning solution to this problem, using a simulation-based inference framework that allows us to estimate posterior distributions of physical source parameters from piled-up eROSITA data. We show that a normalizing flow produces better-constrained posterior densities than traditional mitigation techniques, as more data can be leveraged. We consider model- and calibration-dependent uncertainties and the applicability of such an algorithm to real data in the eROSITA archive.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain valuable, context-rich information, but their unstructured format introduces several challenges, including unintended biases (e.g., gender or racial bias), and poor generalization across clinical settings (e.g., models trained on one EHR system may perform poorly on another due to format differences) and poor interpretability. To address these issues, we present ClinStructor, a pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert clinical free-text into structured, task-specific question-answer pairs prior to predictive modeling. Our method substantially enhances transparency and controllability and only leads to a modest reduction in predictive performance (a 2-3% drop in AUC), compared to direct fine-tuning, on the ICU mortality prediction task. ClinStructor lays a strong foundation for building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning models in clinical environments.

Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.

Abstract: Large Language Models have advanced clinical text classification, but their opaque predictions remain a critical barrier to practical adoption in research and clinical settings where investigators and physicians need to understand which parts of a patient's record drive risk signals. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{CALM}, short for \textbf{Classification with Additive Large Language Models}, an interpretable framework for semi-structured text where inputs are composed of semantically meaningful components, such as sections of an admission note or question-answer fields from an intake form. CALM predicts outcomes as the additive sum of each component's contribution, making these contributions part of the forward computation itself and enabling faithful explanations at both the patient and population level. The additive structure also enables clear visualizations, such as component-level risk curves similar to those used in generalized additive models, making the learned relationships easier to inspect and communicate. Although CALM expects semi-structured inputs, many clinical documents already have this form, and similar structure can often be automatically extracted from free-text notes. CALM achieves performance comparable to conventional LLM classifiers while improving trust, supporting quality-assurance checks, and revealing clinically meaningful patterns during model development and auditing.

Abstract: We study the high-dimensional inference of a rank-one signal corrupted by sparse noise. The noise is modelled as the adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph with finite average connectivity in the large size limit. Using the replica method from statistical physics, we analytically compute the typical value of the top eigenvalue, the top eigenvector component density, and the overlap between the signal vector and the top eigenvector. The solution is given in terms of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. Specialising the noise matrix to Poissonian and Random Regular degree distributions, the critical signal strength is analytically identified at which a transition happens for the recovery of the signal via the top eigenvector, thus generalising the celebrated BBP transition to the sparse noise case. In the large-connectivity limit, known results for dense noise are recovered. Analytical results are in agreement with numerical diagonalisation of large matrices.

Abstract: In Extended Reality (XR), rendering sound that accurately simulates real-world acoustics is pivotal in creating lifelike and believable virtual experiences. However, existing XR spatial audio rendering methods often struggle with real-time adaptation to diverse physical scenes, causing a sensory mismatch between visual and auditory cues that disrupts user immersion. To address this, we introduce SAMOSA, a novel on-device system that renders spatially accurate sound by dynamically adapting to its physical environment. SAMOSA leverages a synergistic multimodal scene representation by fusing real-time estimations of room geometry, surface materials, and semantic-driven acoustic context. This rich representation then enables efficient acoustic calibration via scene priors, allowing the system to synthesize a highly realistic Room Impulse Response (RIR). We validate our system through technical evaluation using acoustic metrics for RIR synthesis across various room configurations and sound types, alongside an expert evaluation (N=12). Evaluation results demonstrate SAMOSA's feasibility and efficacy in enhancing XR auditory realism.

Abstract: Large language model agents for data analysis typically generate and execute code directly on databases. However, when applied to sensitive data, this approach poses significant security risks. To address this issue, we propose a security-motivated alternative: restrict LLMs from direct code generation and data access, and require them to interact with data exclusively through a predefined set of secure, verified tools. Although recent tool-use benchmarks exist, they primarily target tool selection and simple execution rather than the compositional, multi-step reasoning needed for complex data analysis. To reduce this gap, we introduce Indirect Data Engagement (InData), a dataset designed to assess LLMs' multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. InData includes data analysis questions at three difficulty levels--Easy, Medium, and Hard--capturing increasing reasoning complexity. We benchmark 15 open-source LLMs on InData and find that while large models (e.g., gpt-oss-120b) achieve high accuracy on Easy tasks (97.3%), performance drops sharply on Hard tasks (69.6%). These results show that current LLMs still lack robust multi-step tool-based reasoning ability. With InData, we take a step toward enabling the development and evaluation of LLMs with stronger multi-step tool-use capabilities. We will publicly release the dataset and code.

Abstract: Ultrasound-based risk stratification of thyroid nodules is a critical clinical task, but it suffers from high inter-observer variability. While many deep learning (DL) models function as "black boxes," we propose a fully automated, two-stage framework for interpretable malignancy prediction. Our method achieves interpretability by forcing the model to focus only on clinically relevant regions. First, a TransUNet model automatically segments the thyroid nodule. The resulting mask is then used to create a region of interest around the nodule, and this localised image is fed directly into a ResNet-18 classifier. We evaluated our framework using 5-fold cross-validation on a clinical dataset of 349 images, where it achieved a high F1-score of 0.852 for predicting malignancy. To validate its performance, we compared it against a strong baseline using a Random Forest classifier with hand-crafted morphological features, which achieved an F1-score of 0.829. The superior performance of our DL framework suggests that the implicit visual features learned from the localised nodule are more predictive than explicit shape features alone. This is the first fully automated end-to-end pipeline for both detecting thyroid nodules on ultrasound images and predicting their malignancy.

Abstract: Precise neutrino energy reconstruction is essential for next-generation long-baseline oscillation experiments, yet current methods remain limited by large uncertainties in neutrino-nucleus interaction modeling. Even so, it is well established that different interaction channels produce systematically varying amounts of missing energy and therefore yield different reconstruction performance--information that standard calorimetric approaches do not exploit. We introduce a strategy that incorporates this structure by classifying events according to their underlying interaction type prior to energy reconstruction. Using supervised machine-learning techniques trained on labeled generator events, we leverage intrinsic kinematic differences among quasi-elastic scattering, meson-exchange current, resonance production, and deep-inelastic scattering processes. A cross-generator testing framework demonstrates that this classification approach is robust to microphysics mismodeling and, when applied to a simulated DUNE $\nu_\mu$ disappearance analysis, yields improved accuracy and sensitivity. These results highlight a practical path toward reducing reconstruction-driven systematics in future oscillation measurements.

Abstract: In recent years, humanity has begun to experience the catastrophic effects of climate change as economic sectors (such as agriculture) struggle with unpredictable and extreme weather events. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should help us handle these climate challenges but its most promising solutions are not good at dealing with climate-disrupted data; specifically, machine learning methods that work from historical data-distributions, are not good at handling out-of-distribution, outlier events. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, that treats the predictive problems around climate change as being, in part, due to class-imbalance issues; that is, prediction from historical datasets is difficult because, by definition, they lack sufficient minority-class instances of "climate outlier events". This novel data augmentation method -- called Counterfactual-Based SMOTE (CFA-SMOTE) -- combines an instance-based counterfactual method from Explainable AI (XAI) with the well-known class-imbalance method, SMOTE. CFA-SMOTE creates synthetic data-points representing outlier, climate-events that augment the dataset to improve predictive performance. We report comparative experiments using this CFA-SMOTE method, comparing it to benchmark counterfactual and class-imbalance methods under different conditions (i.e., class-imbalance ratios). The focal climate-change domain used relies on predicting grass growth on Irish dairy farms, during Europe-wide drought and forage crisis of 2018.

Abstract: Knowledge graph-based dialogue generation (KG-DG) is a challenging task requiring models to effectively incorporate external knowledge into conversational responses. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across various NLP tasks, their ability to utilize external knowledge in KG-DG remains under-explored. We observe that LLMs often rely on internal knowledge, leading to detachment from provided knowledge graphs, even when they are given a flawlessly retrieved knowledge graph. First, we introduce LLM-KAT, an evaluation procedure for measuring knowledge attachment in generated responses. Second, we propose a simple yet effective entity anonymization technique to encourage LLMs to better leverage external knowledge. Experiments on the OpenDialKG dataset demonstrate that our approach improves LLMs' attachment on external knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Temporal MDS-Vision Transformer (T-MDS-ViT) for multiclass target classification using millimeter-wave FMCW radar micro-Doppler spectrograms. Specifically, we design a transformer-based architecture that processes stacked range-velocity-angle (RVA) spatiotemporal tensors via patch embeddings and cross-axis attention mechanisms to explicitly model the sequential nature of MDS data across multiple frames. The T-MDS-ViT exploits mobility-aware constraints in its attention layer correspondences to maintain separability under target overlaps and partial occlusions. Next, we apply an explainable mechanism to examine how the attention layers focus on characteristic high-energy regions of the MDS representations and their effect on class-specific kinematic features. We also demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing CNN-based methods in terms of classification accuracy while achieving better data efficiency and real-time deployability.

<title>On the Entropy Calibration of Language Models</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of entropy calibration, which asks whether a language model's entropy over generations matches its log loss on human text. Past work found that models are miscalibrated, with entropy per step increasing (and text quality decreasing) as generations grow longer. This error accumulation is a fundamental problem in autoregressive models, and the standard solution is to truncate the distribution, which improves text quality at the cost of diversity. In this paper, we ask: is miscalibration likely to improve with scale, and is it theoretically possible to calibrate without tradeoffs? To build intuition, we first study a simplified theoretical setting to characterize the scaling behavior of miscalibration with respect to dataset size. We find that the scaling behavior depends on the power law exponent of the data distribution -- in particular, for a power law exponent close to 1, the scaling exponent is close to 0, meaning that miscalibration improves very slowly with scale. Next, we measure miscalibration empirically in language models ranging from 0.5B to 70B parameters. We find that the observed scaling behavior is similar to what is predicted by the simplified setting: our fitted scaling exponents for text are close to 0, meaning that larger models accumulate error at a similar rate as smaller ones. This scaling (or, lack thereof) provides one explanation for why we sample from larger models with similar amounts of truncation as smaller models, even though the larger models are of higher quality. However, truncation is not a satisfying solution because it comes at the cost of increased log loss. In theory, is it even possible to reduce entropy while preserving log loss? We prove that it is possible, if we assume access to a black box which can fit models to predict the future entropy of text.

Abstract: Modern epidemiological analytics increasingly use machine learning models that offer strong prediction but often lack calibrated uncertainty. Bayesian methods provide principled uncertainty quantification, yet are viewed as difficult to integrate with contemporary AI workflows. This paper proposes a unified Bayesian and AI framework that combines Bayesian prediction with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.
  We use Bayesian logistic regression to obtain calibrated individual-level disease risk and credible intervals on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. In parallel, we use Gaussian-process Bayesian optimization to tune penalized Cox survival models on the GBSG2 breast cancer cohort. This yields a two-layer system: a Bayesian predictive layer that represents risk as a posterior distribution, and a Bayesian optimization layer that treats model selection as inference over a black-box objective.
  Simulation studies in low- and high-dimensional regimes show that the Bayesian layer provides reliable coverage and improved calibration, while Bayesian shrinkage improves AUC, Brier score, and log-loss. Bayesian optimization consistently pushes survival models toward near-oracle concordance. Overall, Bayesian reasoning enhances both what we infer and how we search, enabling calibrated risk and principled hyperparameter intelligence for epidemiological decision making.

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles across land, water, and air must often operate in dynamic, unpredictable environments with limited communication, no centralized control, and partial observability. These real-world constraints pose significant challenges for coordination, particularly when vehicles pursue individual objectives. To address this, we propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that enables vehicles, acting as agents, to communicate selectively based on local goals and observations. This goal-aware communication strategy allows agents to share only relevant information, enhancing collaboration while respecting visibility limitations. We validate our approach in complex multi-agent navigation tasks featuring obstacles and dynamic agent populations. Results show that our method significantly improves task success rates and reduces time-to-goal compared to non-cooperative baselines. Moreover, task performance remains stable as the number of agents increases, demonstrating scalability. These findings highlight the potential of decentralized, goal-driven MARL to support effective coordination in realistic multi-vehicle systems operating across diverse domains.

Abstract: Despite their wide application, the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks raise societal concerns. Among them, transformation-based attacks have demonstrated notable success in transfer attacks. However, existing attacks suffer from blind spots in parameter optimization, limiting their full potential. Specifically, (1) prior work generally considers low-iteration settings, yet attacks perform quite differently at higher iterations, so characterizing overall performance based only on low-iteration results is misleading. (2) Existing attacks use uniform parameters for different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks, which greatly impairs transferability. (3) Traditional transformation parameter optimization relies on grid search. For n parameters with m steps each, the complexity is O(mn). Large computational overhead limits further optimization of parameters. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study with various transformations as baselines, revealing three dynamic patterns of transferability with respect to parameter strength. We further propose a novel Concentric Decay Model (CDM) to effectively explain these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose an efficient Dynamic Parameter Optimization (DPO) based on the rise-then-fall pattern, reducing the complexity to O(nlogm). Comprehensive experiments on existing transformation-based attacks across different surrogate models, iterations, and tasks demonstrate that our DPO can significantly improve transferability.

Abstract: Deep learning is transforming microscopy, yet models often fail when applied to images from new instruments or acquisition settings. Conventional adversarial domain adaptation (ADDA) retrains entire networks, often disrupting learned semantic representations. Here, we overturn this paradigm by showing that adapting only the earliest convolutional layers, while freezing deeper layers, yields reliable transfer. Building on this principle, we introduce Subnetwork Image Translation ADDA with automatic depth selection (SIT-ADDA-Auto), a self-configuring framework that integrates shallow-layer adversarial alignment with predictive uncertainty to automatically select adaptation depth without target labels. We demonstrate robustness via multi-metric evaluation, blinded expert assessment, and uncertainty-depth ablations. Across exposure and illumination shifts, cross-instrument transfer, and multiple stains, SIT-ADDA improves reconstruction and downstream segmentation over full-encoder adaptation and non-adversarial baselines, with reduced drift of semantic features. Our results provide a design rule for label-free adaptation in microscopy and a recipe for field settings; the code is publicly available.

Abstract: AI tools in pathology have improved screening throughput, standardized quantification, and revealed prognostic patterns that inform treatment. However, adoption remains limited because most systems still lack the human-readable reasoning needed to audit decisions and prevent errors. We present RECAP-PATH, an interpretable framework that establishes a self-learning paradigm, shifting off-the-shelf multimodal large language models from passive pattern recognition to evidence-linked diagnostic reasoning. At its core is a two-phase learning process that autonomously derives diagnostic criteria: diversification expands pathology-style explanations, while optimization refines them for accuracy. This self-learning approach requires only small labeled sets and no white-box access or weight updates to generate cancer diagnoses. Evaluated on breast and prostate datasets, RECAP-PATH produced rationales aligned with expert assessment and delivered substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy over baselines. By uniting visual understanding with reasoning, RECAP-PATH provides clinically trustworthy AI and demonstrates a generalizable path toward evidence-linked interpretation.

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis at signalized intersections is vital for reducing vehicle and pedestrian collisions, yet traditional crash-based studies are limited by data sparsity and latency. This paper presents a novel multi-camera computer vision framework for real-time safety assessment through Post-Encroachment Time (PET) computation, demonstrated at the intersection of H Street and Broadway in Chula Vista, California. Four synchronized cameras provide continuous visual coverage, with each frame processed on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier devices using YOLOv11 segmentation for vehicle detection. Detected vehicle polygons are transformed into a unified bird's-eye map using homography matrices, enabling alignment across overlapping camera views. A novel pixel-level PET algorithm measures vehicle position without reliance on fixed cells, allowing fine-grained hazard visualization via dynamic heatmaps, accurate to 3.3 sq-cm. Timestamped vehicle and PET data is stored in an SQL database for long-term monitoring. Results over various time intervals demonstrate the framework's ability to identify high-risk regions with sub-second precision and real-time throughput on edge devices, producing data for an 800 x 800 pixel logarithmic heatmap at an average of 2.68 FPS. This study validates the feasibility of decentralized vision-based PET analysis for intelligent transportation systems, offering a replicable methodology for high-resolution, real-time, and scalable intersection safety evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning harmonizes distinct modalities by aligning them into a unified latent space. Recent research generalizes traditional cross-modal alignment to produce enhanced multimodal synergy but requires all modalities to be present for a common instance, making it challenging to utilize prevalent datasets with missing modalities. We provide theoretical insights into this issue from an anchor shift perspective. Observed modalities are aligned with a local anchor that deviates from the optimal one when all modalities are present, resulting in an inevitable shift. To address this, we propose CalMRL for multimodal representation learning to calibrate incomplete alignments caused by missing modalities. Specifically, CalMRL leverages the priors and the inherent connections among modalities to model the imputation for the missing ones at the representation level. To resolve the optimization dilemma, we employ a bi-step learning method with the closed-form solution of the posterior distribution of shared latents. We validate its mitigation of anchor shift and convergence with theoretical guidance. By equipping the calibrated alignment with the existing advanced method, we offer new flexibility to absorb data with missing modalities, which is originally unattainable. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses demonstrate the superiority of CalMRL. Our code, model checkpoints, and evaluation raw data will be publicly available.

<title>Preference Learning from Physics-Based Feedback: Tuning Language Models to Design BCC/B2 Superalloys</title>

Abstract: We apply preference learning to the task of language model-guided design of novel structural alloys. In contrast to prior work that focuses on generating stable inorganic crystals, our approach targets the synthesizeability of a specific structural class: BCC/B2 superalloys, an underexplored family of materials with potential applications in extreme environments. Using three open-weight models (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and OLMo-2), we demonstrate that language models can be optimized for multiple design objectives using a single, unified reward signal through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or human-in-the-loop feedback (costly), our reward signal is derived from thermodynamic phase calculations, offering a scientifically grounded criterion for model tuning. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of preference-tuning a language model using physics-grounded feedback for structural alloy design. The resulting framework is general and extensible, providing a path forward for intelligent design-space exploration across a range of physical science domains.

<title>BackWeak: Backdooring Knowledge Distillation Simply with Weak Triggers and Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is essential for compressing large models, yet relying on pre-trained "teacher" models downloaded from third-party repositories introduces serious security risks -- most notably backdoor attacks. Existing KD backdoor methods are typically complex and computationally intensive: they employ surrogate student models and simulated distillation to guarantee transferability, and they construct triggers in a way similar to universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), which being not stealthy in magnitude, inherently exhibit strong adversarial behavior. This work questions whether such complexity is necessary and constructs stealthy "weak" triggers -- imperceptible perturbations that have negligible adversarial effect. We propose BackWeak, a simple, surrogate-free attack paradigm. BackWeak shows that a powerful backdoor can be implanted by simply fine-tuning a benign teacher with a weak trigger using a very small learning rate. We demonstrate that this delicate fine-tuning is sufficient to embed a backdoor that reliably transfers to diverse student architectures during a victim's standard distillation process, yielding high attack success rates. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, model architectures, and KD methods show that BackWeak is efficient, simpler, and often more stealthy than previous elaborate approaches. This work calls on researchers studying KD backdoor attacks to pay particular attention to the trigger's stealthiness and its potential adversarial characteristics.

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with finite-sample coverage. Yet, efficiently leveraging multiple conformity scores to reduce prediction set size remains a major open challenge. Instead of selecting a single best score, this work introduces a principled aggregation strategy, COnfidence-Level Allocation (COLA), that optimally allocates confidence levels across multiple conformal prediction sets to minimize empirical set size while maintaining provable coverage. Two variants are further developed, COLA-s and COLA-f, which guarantee finite-sample marginal coverage via sample splitting and full conformalization, respectively. In addition, we develop COLA-l, an individualized allocation strategy that promotes local size efficiency while achieving asymptotic conditional coverage. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that COLA achieves considerably smaller prediction sets than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining valid coverage.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers detailed access to neural dynamics but remains constrained by noise and trial-by-trial variability, limiting decoding performance in data-restricted or complex paradigms. Data augmentation is often employed to enhance feature representations, yet conventional uniform averaging overlooks differences in trial informativeness and can degrade representational quality. We introduce a weighted bootstrapping approach that prioritizes more reliable trials to generate higher-quality augmented samples. In a Sentence Evaluation paradigm, weights were computed from relative ERP differences and applied during probabilistic sampling and averaging. Across conditions, weighted bootstrapping improved decoding accuracy relative to unweighted (from 68.35% to 71.25% at best), demonstrating that emphasizing reliable trials strengthens representational quality. The results demonstrate that reliability-based augmentation yields more robust and discriminative EEG representations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lyricists/NeuroBootstrap.

<title>From Scaling to Structured Expressivity: Rethinking Transformers for CTR Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12081</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite massive investments in scale, deep models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction often exhibit rapidly diminishing returns - a stark contrast to the smooth, predictable gains seen in large language models. We identify the root cause as a structural misalignment: Transformers assume sequential compositionality, while CTR data demand combinatorial reasoning over high-cardinality semantic fields. Unstructured attention spreads capacity indiscriminately, amplifying noise under extreme sparsity and breaking scalable learning. To restore alignment, we introduce the Field-Aware Transformer (FAT), which embeds field-based interaction priors into attention through decomposed content alignment and cross-field modulation. This design ensures model complexity scales with the number of fields F, not the total vocabulary size n >> F, leading to tighter generalization and, critically, observed power-law scaling in AUC as model width increases. We present the first formal scaling law for CTR models, grounded in Rademacher complexity, that explains and predicts this behavior. On large-scale benchmarks, FAT improves AUC by up to +0.51% over state-of-the-art methods. Deployed online, it delivers +2.33% CTR and +0.66% RPM. Our work establishes that effective scaling in recommendation arises not from size, but from structured expressivity-architectural coherence with data semantics.

Abstract: Phishing and related cyber threats are becoming more varied and technologically advanced. Among these, email-based phishing remains the most dominant and persistent threat. These attacks exploit human vulnerabilities to disseminate malware or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Deep learning (DL) models, particularly transformer-based models, have significantly enhanced phishing mitigation through their contextual understanding of language. However, some recent threats, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated phishing attacks, are reducing the overall system resilience of phishing detectors. In response, adversarial training has shown promise against AI-generated phishing threats. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses DistilBERT, a smaller, faster, and lighter version of the BERT transformer model for email classification. Robustness against text-based adversarial perturbations is reinforced using Fast Gradient Method (FGM) adversarial training. Furthermore, the framework integrates the LIME Explainable AI (XAI) technique to enhance the transparency of the DistilBERT architecture. The framework also uses the Flan-T5-small language model from Hugging Face to generate plain-language security narrative explanations for end-users. This combined approach ensures precise phishing classification while providing easily understandable justifications for the model's decisions.

<title>Decoupled Action Head: Confining Task Knowledge to Conditioning Layers</title>

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a data-driven supervised learning approach that has gained increasing attention with the success of scaling laws in language and vision domains. Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling.

Abstract: We present TEMPO, a global, temporally resolved dataset of building density and height derived from high-resolution satellite imagery using deep learning models. We pair building footprint and height data from existing datasets with quarterly PlanetScope basemap satellite images to train a multi-task deep learning model that predicts building density and building height at a 37.6-meter per pixel resolution. We apply this model to global PlanetScope basemaps from Q1 2018 through Q2 2025 to create global, temporal maps of building density and height. We validate these maps by comparing against existing building footprint datasets. Our estimates achieve an F1 score between 85% and 88% on different hand-labeled subsets, and are temporally stable, with a 0.96 five-year trend-consistency score. TEMPO captures quarterly changes in built settlements at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable approaches, unlocking large-scale monitoring of development patterns and climate impacts essential for global resilience and adaptation efforts.

Abstract: Hash center-based deep hashing methods improve upon pairwise or triplet-based approaches by assigning fixed hash centers to each class as learning targets, thereby avoiding the inefficiency of local similarity optimization. However, random center initialization often disregards inter-class semantic relationships. While existing two-stage methods mitigate this by first refining hash centers with semantics and then training the hash function, they introduce additional complexity, computational overhead, and suboptimal performance due to stage-wise discrepancies. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{Center-Reassigned Hashing (CRH)}$, an end-to-end framework that $\textbf{dynamically reassigns hash centers}$ from a preset codebook while jointly optimizing the hash function. Unlike previous methods, CRH adapts hash centers to the data distribution $\textbf{without explicit center optimization phases}$, enabling seamless integration of semantic relationships into the learning process. Furthermore, $\textbf{a multi-head mechanism}$ enhances the representational capacity of hash centers, capturing richer semantic structures. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that CRH learns semantically meaningful hash centers and outperforms state-of-the-art deep hashing methods in retrieval tasks.

Abstract: The extensive use of pesticides and synthetic dyes poses critical threats to food safety, human health, and environmental sustainability, necessitating rapid and reliable detection methods. Raman spectroscopy offers molecularly specific fingerprints but suffers from spectral noise, fluorescence background, and band overlap, limiting its real-world applicability. Here, we propose a deep learning framework based on ResNet-18 feature extraction, combined with advanced classifiers, including XGBoost, SVM, and their hybrid integration, to detect pesticides and dyes from Raman spectroscopy, called MLRaman. The MLRaman with the CNN-XGBoost model achieved a predictive accuracy of 97.4% and a perfect AUC of 1.0, while it with the CNN-SVM model provided competitive results with robust class-wise discrimination. Dimensionality reduction analyses (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) confirmed the separability of Raman embeddings across 10 analytes, including 7 pesticides and 3 dyes. Finally, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time prediction, which successfully identified unseen Raman spectra from our independent experiments and also literature sources, underscoring strong generalization capacity. This study establishes a scalable, practical MLRaman model for multi-residue contaminant monitoring, with significant potential for deployment in food safety and environmental surveillance.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) approaches, which represent images as sequences of discrete tokens from a finite codebook, have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, the quantization process and the limited codebook size inevitably discard fine-grained information, placing bottlenecks on fidelity. Motivated by this limitation, recent studies have explored autoregressive modeling in continuous latent spaces, which offers higher generation quality. Yet, unlike discrete tokens constrained by a fixed codebook, continuous representations lie in a vast and unstructured space, posing significant challenges for efficient autoregressive modeling. To address these challenges, we introduce MixAR, a novel framework that leverages mixture training paradigms to inject discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous AR modeling. MixAR is a factorized formulation that leverages discrete tokens as prior guidance for continuous autoregressive prediction. We investigate several discrete-continuous mixture strategies, including self-attention (DC-SA), cross-attention (DC-CA), and a simple approach (DC-Mix) that replaces homogeneous mask tokens with informative discrete counterparts. Moreover, to bridge the gap between ground-truth training tokens and inference tokens produced by the pre-trained AR model, we propose Training-Inference Mixture (TI-Mix) to achieve consistent training and generation distributions. In our experiments, we demonstrate a favorable balance of the DC-Mix strategy between computational efficiency and generation fidelity, and consistent improvement of TI-Mix.

Abstract: Obtaining 3D conformations of realistic polyatomic molecules at the quantum chemistry level remains challenging, and although recent machine learning advances offer promise, predicting large-molecule structures still requires substantial computational effort. Here, we introduce StoL, a diffusion model-based framework that enables rapid and knowledge-free generation of large molecular structures from small-molecule data. Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations. This fragment-based strategy eliminates the need for large-molecule training data while maintaining high scalability and transferability. By embedding chemical principles into key steps, StoL ensures faster convergence, chemically rational structures, and broad configurational coverage, as confirmed against DFT calculations.

<title>Suppressing VLM Hallucinations with Spectral Representation Filtering</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently produce hallucinations in the form of descriptions of objects, attributes, or relations that do not exist in the image due to over-reliance on language priors and imprecise cross-modal grounding. We introduce Spectral Representation Filtering (SRF), a lightweight, training-free method to suppress such hallucinations by analyzing and correcting the covariance structure of the model's representations. SRF identifies low-rank hallucination modes through eigendecomposition of the covariance of the differences between features collected for truthful and hallucinatory captions, revealing structured biases in the feature space. A soft spectral filter then attenuates these modes in the feed-forward projection weights of deeper vLLM layers, equalizing feature variance while preserving semantic fidelity. Unlike decoding or retraining-based approaches, SRF operates entirely post-hoc, incurs zero inference overhead, and requires no architectural modifications. Across three families of VLMs (LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and mPLUG-Owl2), SRF consistently reduces hallucination rates on MSCOCO, POPE-VQA, and other visual tasks benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading caption quality.

<title>Consistency Is the Key: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM Generated Text By Checking Inconsistencies About Key Facts</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their remarkable text generation capabilities, often hallucinate and generate text that is factually incorrect and not grounded in real-world knowledge. This poses serious risks in domains like healthcare, finance, and customer support. A typical way to use LLMs is via the APIs provided by LLM vendors where there is no access to model weights or options to fine-tune the model. Existing methods to detect hallucinations in such settings where the model access is restricted or constrained by resources typically require making multiple LLM API calls, increasing latency and API cost. We introduce CONFACTCHECK, an efficient hallucination detection approach that does not leverage any external knowledge base and works on the simple intuition that responses to factual probes within the generated text should be consistent within a single LLM and across different LLMs. Rigorous empirical evaluation on multiple datasets that cover both the generation of factual texts and the open generation shows that CONFACTCHECK can detect hallucinated facts efficiently using fewer resources and achieves higher accuracy scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions. Our code is available here.

Abstract: We approach the search for optimal element ordering in bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and have built an RL agent that learns to perform such global optimisation using the geometric graph representation of the NPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we train an RL agent to perform composition-conserving atomic swap actions on the icosahedral nanoparticle structure. Trained once on randomised $Ag_{X}Au_{309-X}$ compositions and orderings, the agent discovers previously established ground state structure. We show that this optimization is robust to differently ordered initialisations of the same NP compositions. We also demonstrate that a trained policy can extrapolate effectively to NPs of unseen size. However, the efficacy is limited when multiple alloying elements are involved. Our results demonstrate that RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can navigate combinatorial ordering spaces at the nanoparticle scale, and offer a transferable optimisation strategy with the potential to generalise across composition and reduce repeated individual search cost.

Abstract: High-dimensional data often contain low-dimensional signals obscured by structured background noise, which limits the effectiveness of standard PCA. Motivated by contrastive learning, we address the problem of recovering shared signal subspaces from positive pairs, paired observations sharing the same signal but differing in background. Our baseline, PCA+, uses alignment-only contrastive learning and succeeds when background variation is mild, but fails under strong noise or high-dimensional regimes. To address this, we introduce PCA++, a hard uniformity-constrained contrastive PCA that enforces identity covariance on projected features. PCA++ has a closed-form solution via a generalized eigenproblem, remains stable in high dimensions, and provably regularizes against background interference. We provide exact high-dimensional asymptotics in both fixed-aspect-ratio and growing-spike regimes, showing uniformity's role in robust signal recovery. Empirically, PCA++ outperforms standard PCA and alignment-only PCA+ on simulations, corrupted-MNIST, and single-cell transcriptomics, reliably recovering condition-invariant structure. More broadly, we clarify uniformity's role in contrastive learning, showing that explicit feature dispersion defends against structured noise and enhances robustness.

Abstract: Diffusion-based multimodal large language models (Diffusion MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive non-autoregressive generative capabilities across vision-and-language tasks. However, Diffusion MLLMs exhibit substantially slower inference than autoregressive models: Each denoising step employs full bidirectional self-attention over the entire sequence, resulting in cubic decoding complexity that becomes computationally impractical with thousands of visual tokens. To address this challenge, we propose D$^{3}$ToM, a Decider-guided dynamic token merging method that dynamically merges redundant visual tokens at different denoising steps to accelerate inference in Diffusion MLLMs. At each denoising step, D$^{3}$ToM uses decider tokens-the tokens generated in the previous denoising step-to build an importance map over all visual tokens. Then it maintains a proportion of the most salient tokens and merges the remainder through similarity-based aggregation. This plug-and-play module integrates into a single transformer layer, physically shortening the visual token sequence for all subsequent layers without altering model parameters. Moreover, D$^{3}$ToM employs a merge ratio that dynamically varies with each denoising step, aligns with the native decoding process of Diffusion MLLMs, achieving superior performance under equivalent computational budgets. Extensive experiments show that D$^{3}$ToM accelerates inference while preserving competitive performance. The code is released at https://github.com/bcmi/D3ToM-Diffusion-MLLM.

Abstract: Motivated by the high costs of using black-box Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a novel prompt compression paradigm, under which we use smaller LLMs to compress inputs for the larger ones. We present the first comprehensive LLM-as-a-compressor benchmark spanning 25 open- and closed-source models, which reveals significant disparity in models' compression ability in terms of (i) preserving semantically important information (ii) following the user-provided compression rate (CR). We further improve the performance of gpt-4.1-mini, the best overall vanilla compressor, with Textgrad-based compression meta-prompt optimization. We also identify the most promising open-source vanilla LLM - Qwen3-4B - and post-train it with a combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), pursuing the dual objective of CR adherence and maximizing the downstream task performance. We call the resulting model Cmprsr and demonstrate its superiority over both extractive and vanilla abstractive compression across the entire range of compression rates on lengthy inputs from MeetingBank and LongBench as well as short prompts from GSM8k. The latter highlights Cmprsr's generalizability across varying input lengths and domains. Moreover, Cmprsr closely follows the requested compression rate, offering fine control over the cost-quality trade-off.

Abstract: Real-world visual data rarely presents as isolated, static instances. Instead, it often evolves gradually over time through variations in pose, lighting, object state, or scene context. However, conventional classifiers are typically trained under the assumption of temporal independence, limiting their ability to capture such dynamics. We propose a simple yet effective framework that equips standard feedforward classifiers with temporal reasoning, all without modifying model architectures or introducing recurrent modules. At the heart of our approach is a novel Support-Exemplar-Query (SEQ) learning paradigm, which structures training data into temporally coherent trajectories. These trajectories enable the model to learn class-specific temporal prototypes and align prediction sequences via a differentiable soft-DTW loss. A multi-term objective further promotes semantic consistency and temporal smoothness. By interpreting input sequences as evolving feature trajectories, our method introduces a strong temporal inductive bias through loss design alone. This proves highly effective in both static and temporal tasks: it enhances performance on fine-grained and ultra-fine-grained image classification, and delivers precise, temporally consistent predictions in video anomaly detection. Despite its simplicity, our approach bridges static and temporal learning in a modular and data-efficient manner, requiring only a simple classifier on top of pre-extracted features.

Abstract: Accurate turning movement counts at intersections are important for signal control, traffic management and urban planning. Computer vision systems for automatic turning movement counts typically rely on visual analysis in the image plane of an infrastructure camera. Here we explore potential advantages of back-projecting vehicles detected in one or more infrastructure cameras to the ground plane for analysis in real-world 3D coordinates. For single-camera systems we find that back-projection yields more accurate trajectory classification and turning movement counts. We further show that even higher accuracy can be achieved through weak fusion of back-projected detections from multiple cameras. These results suggeest that traffic should be analyzed on the ground plane, not the image plane

<title>CLAReSNet: When Convolution Meets Latent Attention for Hyperspectral Image Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12346</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification faces critical challenges, including high spectral dimensionality, complex spectral-spatial correlations, and limited training samples with severe class imbalance. While CNNs excel at local feature extraction and transformers capture long-range dependencies, their isolated application yields suboptimal results due to quadratic complexity and insufficient inductive biases. We propose CLAReSNet (Convolutional Latent Attention Residual Spectral Network), a hybrid architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutional extraction with transformer-style attention via an adaptive latent bottleneck. The model employs a multi-scale convolutional stem with deep residual blocks and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module for hierarchical spatial features, followed by spectral encoder layers combining bidirectional RNNs (LSTM/GRU) with Multi-Scale Spectral Latent Attention (MSLA). MSLA reduces complexity from $\mathcal{O}(T^2D)$ to $\mathcal{O}(T\log(T)D)$ by adaptive latent token allocation (8-64 tokens) that scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Hierarchical cross-attention fusion dynamically aggregates multi-level representations for robust classification. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines and Salinas datasets show state-of-the-art performance, achieving overall accuracies of 99.71% and 99.96%, significantly surpassing HybridSN, SSRN, and SpectralFormer. The learned embeddings exhibit superior inter-class separability and compact intra-class clustering, validating CLAReSNet's effectiveness under limited samples and severe class imbalance.

<title>More Than Irrational: Modeling Belief-Biased Agents</title>

Abstract: Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations.

Abstract: Medical image analysis for complex tasks such as severity grading and disease subtype classification poses significant challenges due to intricate and similar visual patterns among classes, scarcity of labeled data, and variability in expert interpretations. Despite the usefulness of existing attention-based models in capturing complex visual patterns for medical image classification, underlying architectures often face challenges in effectively distinguishing subtle classes since they struggle to capture inter-class similarity and intra-class variability, resulting in incorrect diagnosis. To address this, we propose AGGRNet framework to extract informative and non-informative features to effectively understand fine-grained visual patterns and improve classification for complex medical image analysis tasks. Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various medical imaging datasets, with the best improvement up to 5% over SOTA models on the Kvasir dataset.

<title>Multi-Domain EEG Representation Learning with Orthogonal Mapping and Attention-based Fusion for Cognitive Load Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.12394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new representation learning solution for the classification of cognitive load based on Electroencephalogram (EEG). Our method integrates both time and frequency domains by first passing the raw EEG signals through the convolutional encoder to obtain the time domain representations. Next, we measure the Power Spectral Density (PSD) for all five EEG frequency bands and generate the channel power values as 2D images referred to as multi-spectral topography maps. These multi-spectral topography maps are then fed to a separate encoder to obtain the representations in frequency domain. Our solution employs a multi-domain attention module that maps these domain-specific embeddings onto a shared embedding space to emphasize more on important inter-domain relationships to enhance the representations for cognitive load classification. Additionally, we incorporate an orthogonal projection constraint during the training of our method to effectively increase the inter-class distances while improving intra-class clustering. This enhancement allows efficient discrimination between different cognitive states and aids in better grouping of similar states within the feature space. We validate the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments on two public EEG datasets, CL-Drive and CLARE for cognitive load classification. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-domain approach over the traditional single-domain techniques. Moreover, we conduct ablation and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of various components of our method. Finally, robustness experiments on different amounts of added noise demonstrate the stability of our method compared to other state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: There is a large class of problems in algebraic combinatorics which can be distilled into the same challenge: construct an explicit combinatorial bijection. Traditionally, researchers have solved challenges like these by visually inspecting the data for patterns, formulating conjectures, and then proving them. But what is to be done if patterns fail to emerge until the data grows beyond human scale? In this paper, we propose a new workflow for discovering combinatorial bijections via machine learning. As a proof of concept, we train a transformer on paired Dyck paths and use its learned attention patterns to derive a new algorithmic description of the zeta map, which we call the \textit{Scaffolding Map}.

<title>GRAPHTEXTACK: A Realistic Black-Box Node Injection Attack on LLM-Enhanced GNNs</title>

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs), which combine structural and textual node information, are ubiquitous across many domains. Recent work integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to jointly model semantics and structure, resulting in more general and expressive models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on TAG benchmarks. However, this integration introduces dual vulnerabilities: GNNs are sensitive to structural perturbations, while LLM-derived features are vulnerable to prompt injection and adversarial phrasing. While existing adversarial attacks largely perturb structure or text independently, we find that uni-modal attacks cause only modest degradation in LLM-enhanced GNNs. Moreover, many existing attacks assume unrealistic capabilities, such as white-box access or direct modification of graph data. To address these gaps, we propose GRAPHTEXTACK, the first black-box, multi-modal{, poisoning} node injection attack for LLM-enhanced GNNs. GRAPHTEXTACK injects nodes with carefully crafted structure and semantics to degrade model performance, operating under a realistic threat model without relying on model internals or surrogate models. To navigate the combinatorial, non-differentiable search space of connectivity and feature assignments, GRAPHTEXTACK introduces a novel evolutionary optimization framework with a multi-objective fitness function that balances local prediction disruption and global graph influence. Extensive experiments on five datasets and two state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced GNN models show that GRAPHTEXTACK significantly outperforms 12 strong baselines.

Abstract: A long road trip is fun for drivers. However, a long drive for days can be tedious for a driver to accommodate stringent deadlines to reach distant destinations. Such a scenario forces drivers to drive extra miles, utilizing extra hours daily without sufficient rest and breaks. Once a driver undergoes such a scenario, it occasionally triggers drowsiness during driving. Drowsiness in driving can be life-threatening to any individual and can affect other drivers' safety; therefore, a real-time detection system is needed. To identify fatigued facial characteristics in drivers and trigger the alarm immediately, this research develops a real-time driver drowsiness detection system utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and OpenCV.Our proposed and implemented model takes real- time facial images of a driver using a live camera and utilizes a Python-based library named OpenCV to examine the facial images for facial landmarks like sufficient eye openings and yawn-like mouth movements. The DCNNs framework then gathers the data and utilizes a per-trained model to detect the drowsiness of a driver using facial landmarks. If the driver is identified as drowsy, the system issues a continuous alert in real time, embedded in the Smart Car technology.By potentially saving innocent lives on the roadways, the proposed technique offers a non-invasive, inexpensive, and cost-effective way to identify drowsiness. Our proposed and implemented DCNNs embedded drowsiness detection model successfully react with NTHU-DDD dataset and Yawn-Eye-Dataset with drowsiness detection classification accuracy of 99.6% and 97% respectively.

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce calls for multimodal models that comprehend rich visual and textual product information. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for product understanding exhibit strong capability in representation learning for e-commerce, they still face three challenges: (i) the modality imbalance induced by modality mixed training; (ii) underutilization of the intrinsic alignment relationships among visual and textual information within a product; and (iii) limited handling of noise in e-commerce multimodal data. To address these, we propose MOON2.0, a dynamic modality-balanced multimodal representation learning framework for e-commerce product understanding. MOON2.0 comprises: (1) a Modality-driven Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module that adaptively processes input samples by their modality composition, enabling Multimodal Joint Learning to mitigate the modality imbalance; (2) a Dual-level Alignment method to better leverage semantic alignment properties inside individual products; and (3) an MLLM-based Image-text Co-augmentation strategy that integrates textual enrichment with visual expansion, coupled with Dynamic Sample Filtering to improve training data quality. We further introduce MBE2.0, a co-augmented multimodal representation benchmark for e-commerce representation learning and evaluation. Experiments show that MOON2.0 delivers state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MBE2.0 and multiple public datasets. Furthermore, attention-based heatmap visualization provides qualitative evidence of improved multimodal alignment of MOON2.0.

Abstract: X-ray scattering measurements of in situ human brain tissue encode structural signatures of pathological cross-$\beta$ inclusions, yet systematic exploitation of these data for automated detection remains challenging due to substrate contamination, strong inter-feature correlations, and limited sample sizes. This work develops a three-stage classification framework for identifying cross-$\beta$ structural inclusions-a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease-in X-ray scattering profiles of post-mortem human brain. Stage 1 employs a Bayes-optimal classifier to separate mica substrate from tissue regions on the basis of their distinct scattering signatures. Stage 2 introduces a multicollinearityaware, class-conditional correlation pruning scheme with formal guarantees on the induced Bayes risk and approximation error, thereby reducing redundancy while retaining class-discriminative information. Stage 3 trains a compact neural network on the pruned feature set to detect the presence or absence of cross-$\beta$ fibrillar ordering. The top-performing model, optimized with a composite loss combining Focal and Dice objectives, attains a test F1-score of 84.30% using 11 of 211 candidate features and 174 trainable parameters. The overall framework yields an interpretable, theory-grounded strategy for data-limited classification problems involving correlated, high-dimensional experimental measurements, exemplified here by X-ray scattering profiles of neurodegenerative tissue.

Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, standard methods relying on active measurements may introduce additional errors. Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) circumvents this by utilizing engineered dissipation and drives in bosonic systems, but identifying practical encoding remains challenging due to stringent Knill-Laflamme conditions. In this work, we utilize curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning to discover Bosonic codes under approximate AQEC framework to resist both single-photon and double-photon losses. We present an analytical solution of solving the master equation under approximation conditions, which can significantly accelerate the training process of reinforcement learning. The agent first identifies an encoded subspace surpassing the breakeven point through rapid exploration within a constrained evolutionary time-frame, then strategically fine-tunes its policy to sustain this performance advantage over extended temporal horizons. We find that the two-phase trained agent can discover the optimal set of codewords, i.e., the Fock states $\ket{4}$ and $\ket{7}$ considering the effect of both single-photon and double-photon loss. We identify that the discovered code surpasses the breakeven threshold over a longer evolution time and achieve the state-of-art performance. We also analyze the robustness of the code against the phase damping and amplitude damping noise. Our work highlights the potential of curriculum learning enabled deep reinforcement learning in discovering the optimal quantum error correct code especially in early fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Abstract: Multi-GPU programming traditionally requires developers to navigate complex trade-offs between performance and programmability. High-performance implementations typically rely on low-level HIP/CUDA communication libraries that demand substantial engineering effort for even basic overlap patterns, while simpler abstractions often sacrifice performance. We present Iris, a multi-GPU communication library implemented entirely in Python and Triton that eliminates this trade-off. Iris provides tile-based symmetric memory abstractions that naturally align with Triton's programming model, enabling developers to write single-source kernels that seamlessly interleave computation and communication. We demonstrate a taxonomy of compute-communication overlap patterns--from bulk-synchronous to fine-grained workgroup specialization--that can be implemented with minimal code changes in Iris, often requiring just a few additional lines within the same Triton kernel. Our evaluation shows that Iris achieves near-optimal bandwidth utilization in microbenchmarks and delivers up to 1.79x speedup over PyTorch and RCCL for GEMM+All-Scatter workloads, demonstrating that high-level implementations can match or exceed heavily-optimized libraries while dramatically simplifying multi-GPU programming.

Abstract: With growing concerns over image authenticity and digital safety, the field of AI-generated image (AIGI) detection has progressed rapidly. Yet, most AIGI detectors still struggle under real-world degradations, particularly motion blur, which frequently occurs in handheld photography, fast motion, and compressed video. Such blur distorts fine textures and suppresses high-frequency artifacts, causing severe performance drops in real-world settings. We address this limitation with a blur-robust AIGI detection framework based on teacher-student knowledge distillation. A high-capacity teacher (DINOv3), trained on clean (i.e., sharp) images, provides stable and semantically rich representations that serve as a reference for learning. By freezing the teacher to maintain its generalization ability, we distill its feature and logit responses from sharp images to a student trained on blurred counterparts, enabling the student to produce consistent representations under motion degradation. Extensive experiments benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under both motion-blurred and clean conditions, demonstrating improved generalization and real-world applicability. Source codes will be released at: https://github.com/JiaLiangShen/Dino-Detect-for-blur-robust-AIGC-Detection.

Abstract: The growing demand for low-power and area-efficient TinyML inference on AIoT devices necessitates memory architectures that minimise data movement while sustaining high computational efficiency. This paper presents FERMI-ML, a Flexible and Resource-Efficient Memory-In-Situ (MIS) SRAM macro designed for TinyML acceleration. The proposed 9T XNOR-based RX9T bit-cell integrates a 5T storage cell with a 4T XNOR compute unit, enabling variable-precision MAC and CAM operations within the same array. A 22-transistor (C22T) compressor-tree-based accumulator facilitates logarithmic 1-64-bit MAC computation with reduced delay and power compared to conventional adder trees. The 4 KB macro achieves dual functionality for in-situ computation and CAM-based lookup operations, supporting Posit-4 or FP-4 precision. Post-layout results at 65 nm show operation at 350 MHz with 0.9 V, delivering a throughput of 1.93 TOPS and an energy efficiency of 364 TOPS/W, while maintaining a Quality-of-Result (QoR) above 97.5% with InceptionV4 and ResNet-18. FERMI-ML thus demonstrates a compact, reconfigurable, and energy-aware digital Memory-In-Situ macro capable of supporting mixed-precision TinyML workloads.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from mode collapse, repeatedly generating the same few completions even when many valid answers exist, limiting their diversity across a wide range of tasks. We introduce Group-Aware Policy Optimization (GAPO), a simple extension of the recent and popular Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that computes rewards over the group as a whole. GAPO enables learning from the group-level properties such as diversity and coverage. We demonstrate GAPO using a frequency-aware reward function that encourages uniform sampling over valid LLM completions, and show that GAPO-trained models produce valid and more diverse model responses. Beyond this setup, GAPO generalizes to open-ended prompts and improves response diversity without compromising accuracy on standard LLM benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MMLU-Pro). Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates object detection and pose estimation with a versatile onboarding process. Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.

Abstract: Context: Large language models (LLMs) are released faster than users' ability to evaluate them rigorously. When LLMs underpin research, such as identifying relevant literature for systematic reviews (SRs), robust empirical assessment is essential. Objective: We identify and discuss key challenges in assessing LLM performance for selecting relevant literature, identify good (evaluation) practices, and propose recommendations. Method: Using a recent large-scale study as an example, we identify problems with the use of traditional metrics for assessing the performance of Gen-AI tools for identifying relevant literature in SRs. We analyzed 27 additional papers investigating this issue, extracted the performance metrics, and found both good practices and widespread problems, especially with the use and reporting of performance metrics for SR screening. Results: Major weaknesses included: i) a failure to use metrics that are robust to imbalanced data and do not directly indicate whether results are better than chance, e.g., the use of Accuracy, ii) a failure to consider the impact of lost evidence when making claims concerning workload savings, and iii) pervasive failure to report the full confusion matrix (or performance metrics from which it can be reconstructed) which is essential for future meta-analyses. On the positive side, we extract good (evaluation) practices on which our recommendations for researchers and practitioners, as well as policymakers, are built. Conclusions: SR screening evaluations should prioritize lost evidence/recall alongside chance-anchored and cost-sensitive Weighted MCC (WMCC) metric, report complete confusion matrices, treat unclassifiable outputs as referred-back positives for assessment, adopt leakage-aware designs with non-LLM baselines and open artifacts, and ground conclusions in cost-benefit analysis where FNs carry higher penalties than FPs.

Abstract: Upgrades to current gravitational wave detectors for the next observation run and upcoming third-generation observatories, like the Einstein telescope, are expected to have enormous improvements in detection sensitivities and compact object merger event rates. Estimation of source parameters for a wider parameter space that these detectable signals will lie in, will be a computational challenge. Thus, it is imperative to have methods to speed-up the likelihood calculations with theoretical waveform predictions, which can ultimately make the parameter estimation faster and aid in rapid multi-messenger follow-ups. Towards this end, we present a conditional variational auto-encoder model, based on the best performing architecture of Liao+2021, for faster generation of aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Our parameter space consists of four parameters, [$m_1$, $m_2$, $\chi_1(z)$, $\chi_2(z)$]. The masses are uniformly sampled in $[5,75]\,M_{\odot}$ with a mass ratio limit at $10\,M_{\odot}$, while the spins are uniform in $[-0.99,0.99]$. We train the model using $\sim10^5$ input waveforms data with a 70\%/10\% train/validation split, while 20\% data are reserved for testing. The median mismatch for the generated waveforms in the test dataset is $\sim10^{-2}$, with better performance in a restricted parameter space of $\chi_{\rm eff}\in[-0.80,0.80]$. Our model is able to generate 100 waveforms in 0.1 second at an average speed of about 4.46 ms per waveform. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the native SEOBNRv4 implementation in lalsimulation. The latent sampling uncertainty of our model can be quantified with a mean mismatch deviation of $2\times10^{-1}$ for 1000 generations of the same waveform. Our work aims to be the first step towards developing a production-ready machine learning framework for the faster generation of gravitational waveform approximations.

Abstract: Web Application Firewalls are crucial for protecting web applications against a wide range of cyber threats. Traditional Web Application Firewalls often struggle to effectively distinguish between malicious and legitimate traffic, leading to limited efficacy in threat detection. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an Adaptive Dual-Layer WAF employing a two-layered Machine Learning model designed to enhance the accuracy of anomaly and threat detection. The first layer employs a Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to detect anomalies by identifying traffic deviations from established normal patterns. The second layer employs Support Vector Machine to classify these anomalies as either threat anomalies or benign anomalies. Our Adaptive Dual Layer WAF incorporates comprehensive data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques and has been thoroughly evaluated using five large benchmark datasets. Evaluation using these datasets shows that ADL WAF achieves a detection accuracy of 99.88% and a precision of 100%, significantly enhancing anomaly detection and reducing false positives. These findings suggest that integrating machine learning techniques into WAFs can substantially improve web application security by providing more accurate and efficient threat detection.

<title>Scalable Hierarchical AI-Blockchain Framework for Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Large-Scale Autonomous Vehicle Networks</title>

Abstract: The security of autonomous vehicle networks is facing major challenges, owing to the complexity of sensor integration, real-time performance demands, and distributed communication protocols that expose vast attack surfaces around both individual and network-wide safety. Existing security schemes are unable to provide sub-10 ms (milliseconds) anomaly detection and distributed coordination of large-scale networks of vehicles within an acceptable safety/privacy framework. This paper introduces a three-tier hybrid security architecture HAVEN (Hierarchical Autonomous Vehicle Enhanced Network), which decouples real-time local threat detection and distributed coordination operations. It incorporates a light ensemble anomaly detection model on the edge (first layer), Byzantine-fault-tolerant federated learning to aggregate threat intelligence at a regional scale (middle layer), and selected blockchain mechanisms (top layer) to ensure critical security coordination. Extensive experimentation is done on a real-world autonomous driving dataset. Large-scale simulations with the number of vehicles ranging between 100 and 1000 and different attack types, such as sensor spoofing, jamming, and adversarial model poisoning, are conducted to test the scalability and resiliency of HAVEN. Experimental findings show sub-10 ms detection latency with an accuracy of 94% and F1-score of 92% across multimodal sensor data, Byzantine fault tolerance validated with 20\% compromised nodes, and a reduced blockchain storage overhead, guaranteeing sufficient differential privacy. The proposed framework overcomes the important trade-off between real-time safety obligation and distributed security coordination with novel three-tiered processing. The scalable architecture of HAVEN is shown to provide great improvement in detection accuracy as well as network resilience over other methods.

<title>AI Bill of Materials and Beyond: Systematizing Security Assurance through the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework</title>

Abstract: Assurance for artificial intelligence (AI) systems remains fragmented across software supply-chain security, adversarial machine learning, and governance documentation. Existing transparency mechanisms - including Model Cards, Datasheets, and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) - advance provenance reporting but rarely provide verifiable, machine-readable evidence of model security. This paper introduces the AI Risk Scanning (AIRS) Framework, a threat-model-based, evidence-generating framework designed to operationalize AI assurance. The AIRS Framework evolved through three progressive pilot studies - Smurf (AIBOM schema design), OPAL (operational validation), and Pilot C (AIRS) - that reframed AI documentation from descriptive disclosure toward measurable, evidence-bound verification. The framework aligns its assurance fields to the MITRE ATLAS adversarial ML taxonomy and automatically produces structured artifacts capturing model integrity, packaging and serialization safety, structural adapters, and runtime behaviors. Currently, the AIRS Framework is scoped to provide model-level assurances for LLMs, but it could be expanded to include other modalities and cover system-level threats (e.g. application-layer abuses, tool-calling). A proof-of-concept on a quantized GPT-OSS-20B model demonstrates enforcement of safe loader policies, per-shard hash verification, and contamination and backdoor probes executed under controlled runtime conditions. Comparative analysis with SBOM standards of SPDX 3.0 and CycloneDX 1.6 reveals alignment on identity and evaluation metadata, but identifies critical gaps in representing AI-specific assurance fields. The AIRS Framework thus extends SBOM practice to the AI domain by coupling threat modeling with automated, auditable evidence generation, providing a principled foundation for standardized, trustworthy, and machine-verifiable AI risk documentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the finite-sample statistical rates of distributional temporal difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. The purpose of distributional TD learning is to estimate the return distribution of a discounted Markov decision process for a given policy. Previous works on statistical analysis of distributional TD learning focus mainly on the tabular case. We first consider the linear function approximation setting and conduct a fine-grained analysis of the linear-categorical Bellman equation. Building on this analysis, we further incorporate variance reduction techniques in our new algorithms to establish tight sample complexity bounds independent of the support size $K$ when $K$ is large. Our theoretical results imply that, when employing distributional TD learning with linear function approximation, learning the full distribution of the return function from streaming data is no more difficult than learning its expectation. This work provide new insights into the statistical efficiency of distributional reinforcement learning algorithms.

<title>Improving Direct Persian-English Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete Units and Synthetic Parallel Data</title>

Abstract: Direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), in which all components are trained jointly, is an attractive alternative to cascaded systems because it offers a simpler pipeline and lower inference latency. However, direct S2ST models require large amounts of parallel speech data in the source and target languages, which are rarely available for low-resource languages such as Persian. This paper presents a direct S2ST system for translating Persian speech into English speech, as well as a pipeline for synthetic parallel Persian-English speech generation. The model comprises three components: (1) a conformer-based encoder, initialized from self-supervised pre-training, maps source speech to high-level acoustic representations; (2) a causal transformer decoder with relative position multi-head attention translates these representations into discrete target speech units; (3) a unit-based neural vocoder generates waveforms from the predicted discrete units. To mitigate the data scarcity problem, we construct a new Persian-English parallel speech corpus by translating Persian speech transcriptions into English using a large language model and then synthesizing the corresponding English speech with a state-of-the-art zero-shot text-to-speech system. The resulting corpus increases the amount of available parallel speech by roughly a factor of six. On the Persian-English portion of the CVSS corpus, the proposed model achieves improvement of 4.6 ASR BLEU with the synthetic data over direct baselines. These results indicate that combining self-supervised pre-training, discrete speech units, and synthetic parallel data is effective for improving direct S2ST in low-resource language pairs such as Persian-English

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering linear computational complexity while achieving competitive performance. Yet, despite their effectiveness, understanding how these Vision SSMs process spatial information remains challenging due to the lack of transparent, attention-like mechanisms. To address this gap, we introduce a controllability-based interpretability framework that quantifies how different parts of the input sequence (tokens or patches) influence the internal state dynamics of SSMs. We propose two complementary formulations: a Jacobian-based method applicable to any SSM architecture that measures influence through the full chain of state propagation, and a Gramian-based approach for diagonal SSMs that achieves superior speed through closed-form analytical solutions. Both methods operate in a single forward pass with linear complexity, requiring no architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. We validate our framework through experiments on three diverse medical imaging modalities, demonstrating that SSMs naturally implement hierarchical feature refinement from diffuse low-level textures in early layers to focused, clinically meaningful patterns in deeper layers. Our analysis reveals domain-specific controllability signatures aligned with diagnostic criteria, progressive spatial selectivity across the network hierarchy, and the substantial influence of scanning strategies on attention patterns. Beyond medical imaging, we articulate applications spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-domain tasks. Our framework establishes controllability analysis as a unified, foundational interpretability paradigm for SSMs across all domains. Code and analysis tools will be made available upon publication

<title>An Evaluation Framework for Network IDS/IPS Datasets: Leveraging MITRE ATT&amp;CK and Industry Relevance Metrics</title>

Abstract: The performance of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) is critically dependent on the relevance and quality of the datasets used for training and evaluation. However, current AI model evaluation practices for developing IDS/IPS focus predominantly on accuracy metrics, often overlooking whether datasets represent industry-specific threats. To address this gap, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional framework that integrates the MITRE ATT&amp;CK knowledge base for threat intelligence and employs five complementary metrics that together provide a comprehensive assessment of dataset suitability. Methodologically, this framework combines threat intelligence, natural language processing, and quantitative analysis to assess the suitability of datasets for specific industry contexts. Applying this framework to nine publicly available IDS/IPS datasets reveals significant gaps in threat coverage, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and financial sectors. In particular, recent datasets (e.g., CIC-IoMT, CIC-UNSW-NB15) align better with sector-specific threats, whereas others, like CICIoV-24, underperform despite their recency. Our findings provide a standardized, interpretable approach for selecting datasets aligned with sector-specific operational requirements, ultimately enhancing the real-world effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS deployments. The efficiency and practicality of the framework are validated through deployment in a real-world case study, underscoring its capacity to inform dataset selection and enhance the effectiveness of AI-driven IDS/IPS in operational environments.

<title>TSB-HB: A Hierarchical Bayesian Extension of the TSB Model for Intermittent Demand Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12749</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Intermittent demand forecasting poses unique challenges due to sparse observations, cold-start items, and obsolescence. Classical models such as Croston, SBA, and the Teunter-Syntetos-Babai (TSB) method provide simple heuristics but lack a principled generative foundation. Deep learning models address these limitations but often require large datasets and sacrifice interpretability.
  We introduce TSB-HB, a hierarchical Bayesian extension of TSB. Demand occurrence is modeled with a Beta-Binomial distribution, while nonzero demand sizes follow a Log-Normal distribution. Crucially, hierarchical priors enable partial pooling across items, stabilizing estimates for sparse or cold-start series while preserving heterogeneity. This framework yields a fully generative and interpretable model that generalizes classical exponential smoothing.
  On the UCI Online Retail dataset, TSB-HB achieves lower RMSE and RMSSE than Croston, SBA, TSB, ADIDA, IMAPA, ARIMA and Theta, and on a subset of the M5 dataset it outperforms all classical baselines we evaluate. The model provides calibrated probabilistic forecasts and improved accuracy on intermittent and lumpy items by combining a generative formulation with hierarchical shrinkage, while remaining interpretable and scalable.

Abstract: Adaptation is the cornerstone of effective collaboration among heterogeneous team members. In human-agent teams, artificial agents need to adapt to their human partners in real time, as individuals often have unique preferences and policies that may change dynamically throughout interactions. This becomes particularly challenging in tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces, where identifying partner behaviors and selecting suitable responses is difficult. In this work, we introduce a strategy-conditioned cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a broad range of potential partner strategies in real-time. Our approach encodes strategies with a variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from agent trajectory data, identifies distinct strategy types through clustering, and trains a cooperator agent conditioned on these clusters by generating partners of each strategy type. For online adaptation to novel partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization algorithm that dynamically infers and adjusts the partner's strategy estimation during interaction. We evaluate our method in a modified version of the Overcooked domain, a complex collaborative cooking environment that requires effective coordination among two players with a diverse potential strategy space. Through these experiments and an online user study, we demonstrate that our proposed agent achieves state of the art performance compared to existing baselines when paired with novel human, and agent teammates.

<title>Prompt-Driven Domain Adaptation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving via In-Context RL</title>

Abstract: Despite significant progress and advances in autonomous driving, many end-to-end systems still struggle with domain adaptation (DA), such as transferring a policy trained under clear weather to adverse weather conditions. Typical DA strategies in the literature include collecting additional data in the target domain or re-training the model, or both. Both these strategies quickly become impractical as we increase scale and complexity of driving. These limitations have encouraged investigation into few-shot and zero-shot prompt-driven DA at inference time involving LLMs and VLMs. These methods work by adding a few state-action trajectories during inference to the prompt (similar to in-context learning). However, there are two limitations of such an approach: $(i)$ prompt-driven DA methods are currently restricted to perception tasks such as detection and segmentation and $(ii)$ they require expert few-shot data. In this work, we present a new approach to inference-time few-shot prompt-driven DA for closed-loop autonomous driving in adverse weather condition using in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). Similar to other prompt-driven DA methods, our approach does not require any updates to the model parameters nor does it require additional data collection in adversarial weather regime. Furthermore, our approach advances the state-of-the-art in prompt-driven DA by extending to closed driving using general trajectories observed during inference. Our experiments using the CARLA simulator show that ICRL results in safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in the target domain compared to state-of-the-art prompt-driven DA baselines.

Abstract: Automatic sign language recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between deaf communities and hearing individuals; however, most available datasets focus on American Sign Language. For Romanian Isolated Sign Language Recognition (RoISLR), no large-scale, standardized dataset exists, which limits research progress. In this work, we introduce a new corpus for RoISLR, named RoCoISLR, comprising over 9,000 video samples that span nearly 6,000 standardized glosses from multiple sources. We establish benchmark results by evaluating seven state-of-the-art video recognition models-I3D, SlowFast, Swin Transformer, TimeSformer, Uniformer, VideoMAE, and PoseConv3D-under consistent experimental setups, and compare their performance with that of the widely used WLASL2000 corpus. According to the results, transformer-based architectures outperform convolutional baselines; Swin Transformer achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 34.1%. Our benchmarks highlight the challenges associated with long-tail class distributions in low-resource sign languages, and RoCoISLR provides the initial foundation for systematic RoISLR research.

<title>Event-CausNet: Unlocking Causal Knowledge from Text with Large Language Models for Reliable Spatio-Temporal Forecasting</title>

Abstract: While spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling recurring traffic patterns, their reliability plummets during non-recurring events like accidents. This failure occurs because GNNs are fundamentally correlational models, learning historical patterns that are invalidated by the new causal factors introduced during disruptions. To address this, we propose Event-CausNet, a framework that uses a Large Language Model to quantify unstructured event reports, builds a causal knowledge base by estimating average treatment effects, and injects this knowledge into a dual-stream GNN-LSTM network using a novel causal attention mechanism to adjust and enhance the forecast. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Event-CausNet achieves robust performance, reducing prediction error (MAE) by up to 35.87%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our framework bridges the gap between correlational models and causal reasoning, providing a solution that is more accurate and transferable, while also offering crucial interpretability, providing a more reliable foundation for real-world traffic management during critical disruptions.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) has been widely used to optimize expensive and gradient-free objective functions across various domains. However, existing BO methods have not addressed the objective where both inputs and outputs are functions, which increasingly arise in complex systems as advanced sensing technologies. To fill this gap, we propose a novel function-on-function Bayesian optimization (FFBO) framework. Specifically, we first introduce a function-on-function Gaussian process (FFGP) model with a separable operator-valued kernel to capture the correlations between function-valued inputs and outputs. Compared to existing Gaussian process models, FFGP is modeled directly in the function space. Based on FFGP, we define a scalar upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function using a weighted operator-based scalarization strategy. Then, a scalable functional gradient ascent algorithm (FGA) is developed to efficiently identify the optimal function-valued input. We further analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the superior performance of FFBO over existing approaches.

Abstract: Solving Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) problems with neural networks is a key challenge in Neural-Symbolic Ar- tificial Intelligence (AI). While most research has focused on designing novel network architectures for individual prob- lems, less effort has been devoted to exploring new learning paradigms involving a sequence of problems. In this work, we investigate lifelong learning ILP, which leverages the com- positional and transferable nature of logic rules for efficient learning of new problems. We introduce a compositional framework, demonstrating how logic rules acquired from ear- lier tasks can be efficiently reused in subsequent ones, leading to improved scalability and performance. We formalize our approach and empirically evaluate it on sequences of tasks. Experimental results validate the feasibility and advantages of this paradigm, opening new directions for continual learn- ing in Neural-Symbolic AI.

Abstract: Estimating causal networks from biological data is a critical step in systems biology. When evaluating the inferred network, assessing the networks based on their intervention effects is particularly important for downstream probabilistic reasoning and the identification of potential drug targets. In the context of gene regulatory network inference, biological databases are often used as reference sources. These databases typically describe relationships in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. However, few evaluation metrics have been developed that take this qualitative nature into account. To address this, we developed a metric, the sign-augmented Structural Intervention Distance (sSID), and a weighted sSID that incorporates the net effects of the intervention. Through simulations and analyses of real transcriptomic datasets, we found that our proposed metrics could identify a different algorithm as optimal compared to conventional metrics, and the network selected by sSID had a superior performance in the classification task of clinical covariates using transcriptomic data. This suggests that sSID can distinguish networks that are structurally correct but functionally incorrect, highlighting its potential as a more biologically meaningful and practical evaluation metric.

Abstract: Over the past few years, improving LLM code generation capabilities has been a key focus in NLP research. Despite Bengali having 242 million native speakers worldwide, it receives little attention when it comes to training LLMs. More recently, various fine-tuning and augmented generation techniques have been employed to significantly enhance code generation performance. However, they require considerable expertise and resources to utilize effectively as an end user. The goal of our work is to democratize access to powerful code generation tools in resource-constrained emerging markets, enabling users to leverage them in their native language.
  We introduce a novel approach that combines Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Code Interpreter (CI), utilizing open-weight models, which improves the baseline accuracy for code generation with Bengali prompts and achieves an overall accuracy of 85%. Our approach requires no finetuning and proves that even the smallest models in the same family can attain up to 98% accuracy compared to the largest models. All of our results are publicly shared in GitHub for validation and reproducibility.

While recent advances in adversarial defenses have demonstrated strong robustness improvements, they often introduce computational overhead ranging from 4x to 22x, which presents significant challenges for production systems processing millions of samples daily. In this work, we propose a novel framework that combines Trust-Raw Override (TRO) with Confidence-Adaptive Bit-Depth Reduction (CABDR) to explicitly optimize the trade-off between adversarial robustness and computational efficiency. Our approach leverages adaptive confidence-based mechanisms to selectively apply defensive measures, achieving 1.76x computational overhead - a 2.3x improvement over state-of-the-art smoothing defenses. Through comprehensive evaluation on the EMBER v2 dataset comprising 800K samples, we demonstrate that our framework maintains 91 percent clean accuracy while reducing attack success rates to 31-37 percent across multiple attack types, with particularly strong performance against optimization-based attacks such as C and W (48.8 percent reduction). The framework achieves throughput of up to 1.26 million samples per second (measured on pre-extracted EMBER features with no runtime feature extraction), validated across 72 production configurations with statistical significance (5 independent runs, 95 percent confidence intervals, p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that practical adversarial robustness in production environments requires explicit optimization of the efficiency-robustness trade-off, providing a viable path for organizations to deploy robust defenses without prohibitive infrastructure costs.

Abstract: Sampling from a target distribution induced by training data is central to Bayesian learning, with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) serving as a key tool for scalable posterior sampling and decentralized variants enabling learning when data are distributed across a network of agents. This paper introduces DIGing-SGLD, a decentralized SGLD algorithm designed for scalable Bayesian learning in multi-agent systems operating over time-varying networks. Existing decentralized SGLD methods are restricted to static network topologies, and many exhibit steady-state sampling bias caused by network effects, even when full batches are used. DIGing-SGLD overcomes these limitations by integrating Langevin-based sampling with the gradient-tracking mechanism of the DIGing algorithm, originally developed for decentralized optimization over time-varying networks, thereby enabling efficient and bias-free sampling without a central coordinator. To our knowledge, we provide the first finite-time non-asymptotic Wasserstein convergence guarantees for decentralized SGLD-based sampling over time-varying networks, with explicit constants. Under standard strong convexity and smoothness assumptions, DIGing-SGLD achieves geometric convergence to an $O(\sqrt{\eta})$ neighborhood of the target distribution, where $\eta$ is the stepsize, with dependence on the target accuracy matching the best-known rates for centralized and static-network SGLD algorithms using constant stepsize. Numerical experiments on Bayesian linear and logistic regression validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the strong empirical performance of DIGing-SGLD under dynamically evolving network conditions.

<title>Benign Overfitting in Linear Classifiers with a Bias Term</title>

Abstract: Modern machine learning models with a large number of parameters often generalize well despite perfectly interpolating noisy training data - a phenomenon known as benign overfitting. A foundational explanation for this in linear classification was recently provided by Hashimoto et al. (2025). However, this analysis was limited to the setting of "homogeneous" models, which lack a bias (intercept) term - a standard component in practice. This work directly extends Hashimoto et al.'s results to the more realistic inhomogeneous case, which incorporates a bias term. Our analysis proves that benign overfitting persists in these more complex models. We find that the presence of the bias term introduces new constraints on the data's covariance structure required for generalization, an effect that is particularly pronounced when label noise is present. However, we show that in the isotropic case, these new constraints are dominated by the requirements inherited from the homogeneous model. This work provides a more complete picture of benign overfitting, revealing the non-trivial impact of the bias term on the conditions required for good generalization.

Abstract: Macroscopic dynamical descriptions of complex physical systems are crucial for understanding and controlling material behavior. With the growing availability of data and compute, machine learning has become a promising alternative to first-principles methods to build accurate macroscopic models from microscopic trajectory simulations. However, for spatially extended systems, direct simulations of sufficiently large microscopic systems that inform macroscopic behavior is prohibitive. In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical upsampling scheme that enables efficient generation of large-system snapshots from small-system trajectory distributions. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our framework through a variety of stochastic spatially extended systems, including those described by stochastic partial differential equations, idealised lattice spin systems, and a more realistic NbMoTa alloy system.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology that aligns agent behavior with human preferences by integrating human feedback into the agent's training process. We introduce a possible framework that employs passive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to guide agent training from implicit neural signals. We present and release a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: a Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems.

Abstract: Generative model-based imitation learning methods have recently achieved strong results in learning high-complexity motor skills from human demonstrations. However, imitation learning of interactive policies that coordinate with humans in shared spaces without explicit communication remains challenging, due to the significantly higher behavioral complexity in multi-agent interactions compared to non-interactive tasks. In this work, we introduce a structured imitation learning framework for interactive policies by combining generative single-agent policy learning with a flexible yet expressive game-theoretic structure. Our method explicitly separates learning into two steps: first, we learn individual behavioral patterns from multi-agent demonstrations using standard imitation learning; then, we structurally learn inter-agent dependencies by solving an inverse game problem. Preliminary results in a synthetic 5-agent social navigation task show that our method significantly improves non-interactive policies and performs comparably to the ground truth interactive policy using only 50 demonstrations. These results highlight the potential of structured imitation learning in interactive settings.

Abstract: Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents a transformer-based approach for classifying hope expressions in text. We developed and compared three architectures (BERT, GPT-2, and DeBERTa) for both binary classification (Hope vs. Not Hope) and multiclass categorization (five hope-related categories). Our initial BERT implementation achieved 83.65% binary and 74.87% multiclass accuracy. In the extended comparison, BERT demonstrated superior performance (84.49% binary, 72.03% multiclass accuracy) while requiring significantly fewer computational resources (443s vs. 704s training time) than newer architectures. GPT-2 showed lowest overall accuracy (79.34% binary, 71.29% multiclass), while DeBERTa achieved moderate results (80.70% binary, 71.56% multiclass) but at substantially higher computational cost (947s for multiclass training). Error analysis revealed architecture-specific strengths in detecting nuanced hope expressions, with GPT-2 excelling at sarcasm detection (92.46% recall). This study provides a framework for computational analysis of hope, with applications in mental health and social media analysis, while demonstrating that architectural suitability may outweigh model size for specialized emotion detection tasks.

<title>Tokenize Once, Recommend Anywhere: Unified Item Tokenization for Multi-domain LLM-based Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.

Abstract: Most neural network quantization methods apply uniform bit precision across spatial regions, ignoring the heterogeneous structural and textural complexity of visual data. This paper introduces MCAQ-YOLO, a morphological complexity-aware quantization framework for object detection. The framework employs five morphological metrics - fractal dimension, texture entropy, gradient variance, edge density, and contour complexity - to characterize local visual morphology and guide spatially adaptive bit allocation. By correlating these metrics with quantization sensitivity, MCAQ-YOLO dynamically adjusts bit precision according to spatial complexity. In addition, a curriculum-based quantization-aware training scheme progressively increases quantization difficulty to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Experimental results demonstrate a strong correlation between morphological complexity and quantization sensitivity and show that MCAQ-YOLO achieves superior detection accuracy and convergence efficiency compared with uniform quantization. On a safety equipment dataset, MCAQ-YOLO attains 85.6 percent mAP@0.5 with an average of 4.2 bits and a 7.6x compression ratio, yielding 3.5 percentage points higher mAP than uniform 4-bit quantization while introducing only 1.8 ms of additional runtime overhead per image. Cross-dataset validation on COCO and Pascal VOC further confirms consistent performance gains, indicating that morphology-driven spatial quantization can enhance efficiency and robustness for computationally constrained, safety-critical visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Lead (Pb) is a typical low-melting-point ductile metal and serves as an important model material in the study of dynamic responses. Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions.

<title>GEM: Generative Entropy-Guided Preference Modeling for Few-shot Alignment of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences typically relies on supervised reward models or external judges that demand abundant annotations. However, in fields that rely on professional knowledge, such as medicine and law, such large-scale preference labels are often unachievable. In this paper, we propose a generative entropy-guided preference modeling approach named GEM for LLMs aligment at low-resource and domain-specific scenarios. Instead of training a discriminative reward model on preference data, we directly train the LLM to internalize a closed-loop optimization architecture that can extract and exploit the multi-dimensional, fine-grained cognitive signals implicit in human preferences. Specifically, our Cognitive Filtering module, based on entropy theory in decision making, first leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate diverse candidate reasoning chains (CoTs) from preference data. Subsequently, it introduces a token scoring mechanism to rank and weight the sampled CoTs, boosting the importance of high-confidence answers and strategically high-entropy tokens. Building on these filtered preferences, we fine-tune the LLM using a novel self-evaluated group advantage algorithm, SEGA, which effectively aggregates group-level cognitive signals and transforms the entropy-based scores into implicit rewards for policy optimization. In these ways, GEM empowers the LLM to rely on its own judgments and establishes an entropy-guided closed-loop cognitive optimization framework, enabling highly efficient few-shot alignment of LLMs. Experiments on general benchmarks and domain-specific tasks (such as mathematical reasoning and medical dialogues) demonstrate that our GEM achieves significant improvements with few-shot preference data.

Abstract: MeanFlow (MF) is a diffusion-motivated generative model that enables efficient few-step generation by learning long jumps directly from noise to data. In practice, it is often used as a latent MF by leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) for high-dimensional data modeling. However, MF training remains computationally demanding and is often unstable. During inference, the SD-VAE decoder dominates the generation cost, and MF depends on complex guidance hyperparameters for class-conditional generation. In this work, we develop an efficient training and sampling scheme for MF in the latent space of a Representation Autoencoder (RAE), where a pre-trained vision encoder (e.g., DINO) provides semantically rich latents paired with a lightweight decoder. We observe that naive MF training in the RAE latent space suffers from severe gradient explosion. To stabilize and accelerate training, we adopt Consistency Mid-Training for trajectory-aware initialization and use a two-stage scheme: distillation from a pre-trained flow matching teacher to speed convergence and reduce variance, followed by an optional bootstrapping stage with a one-point velocity estimator to further reduce deviation from the oracle mean flow. This design removes the need for guidance, simplifies training configurations, and reduces computation in both training and sampling. Empirically, our method achieves a 1-step FID of 2.03, outperforming vanilla MF's 3.43, while reducing sampling GFLOPS by 38% and total training cost by 83% on ImageNet 256. We further scale our approach to ImageNet 512, achieving a competitive 1-step FID of 3.23 with the lowest GFLOPS among all baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/sony/mf-rae.

Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing the intrinsic geometry of a manifold from noisy pairwise distance observations. Specifically, let $M$ denote a diameter 1 d-dimensional manifold and $\mu$ a probability measure on $M$ that is mutually absolutely continuous with the volume measure. Suppose $X_1,\dots,X_N$ are i.i.d. samples of $\mu$ and we observe noisy-distance random variables $d'(X_j, X_k)$ that are related to the true geodesic distances $d(X_j,X_k)$. With mild assumptions on the distributions and independence of the noisy distances, we develop a new framework for recovering all distances between points in a sufficiently dense subsample of $M$. Our framework improves on previous work which assumed i.i.d. additive noise with known moments. Our method is based on a new way to estimate $L_2$-norms of certain expectation-functions $f_x(y)=\mathbb{E}d'(x,y)$ and use them to build robust clusters centered at points of our sample. Using a new geometric argument, we establish that, under mild geometric assumptions--bounded curvature and positive injectivity radius--these clusters allow one to recover the true distances between points in the sample up to an additive error of $O(\varepsilon \log \varepsilon^{-1})$. We develop two distinct algorithms for producing these clusters. The first achieves a sample complexity $N \asymp \varepsilon^{-2d-2}\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and runtime $o(N^3)$. The second introduces novel geometric ideas that warrant further investigation. In the presence of missing observations, we show that a quantitative lower bound on sampling probabilities suffices to modify the cluster construction in the first algorithm and extend all recovery guarantees. Our main technical result also elucidates which properties of a manifold are necessary for the distance recovery, which suggests further extension of our techniques to a broader class of metric probability spaces.

Abstract: Low-cost micro-electromechanical accelerometers are widely used in navigation, robotics, and consumer devices for motion sensing and position estimation. However, their performance is often degraded by bias errors. To eliminate deterministic bias terms a calibration procedure is applied under stationary conditions. It requires accelerom- eter leveling or complex orientation-dependent calibration procedures. To overcome those requirements, in this paper we present a model-free learning-based calibration method that estimates accelerometer bias under stationary conditions, without requiring knowledge of the sensor orientation and without the need to rotate the sensors. The proposed approach provides a fast, practical, and scalable solution suitable for rapid field deployment. Experimental validation on a 13.39-hour dataset collected from six accelerometers shows that the proposed method consistently achieves error levels more than 52% lower than traditional techniques. On a broader scale, this work contributes to the advancement of accurate calibration methods in orientation-free scenarios. As a consequence, it improves the reliability of low-cost inertial sensors in diverse scientific and industrial applications and eliminates the need for leveled calibration.

Abstract: Saliency maps are widely used for visual explanations in deep learning, but a fundamental lack of consensus persists regarding their intended purpose and alignment with diverse user queries. This ambiguity hinders the effective evaluation and practical utility of explanation methods.We address this gap by introducing the Reference-Frame $\times$ Granularity (RFxG) taxonomy, a principled conceptual framework that organizes saliency explanations along two essential axes:Reference-Frame: Distinguishing between pointwise ("Why this prediction?") and contrastive ("Why this and not an alternative?") explanations.Granularity: Ranging from fine-grained class-level (e.g., "Why Husky?") to coarse-grained group-level (e.g., "Why Dog?") interpretations.Using the RFxG lens, we demonstrate critical limitations in existing evaluation metrics, which overwhelmingly prioritize pointwise faithfulness while neglecting contrastive reasoning and semantic granularity. To systematically assess explanation quality across both RFxG dimensions, we propose four novel faithfulness metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation framework applies these metrics to ten state-of-the-art saliency methods, four model architectures, and three datasets.By advocating a shift toward user-intent-driven evaluation, our work provides both the conceptual foundation and the practical tools necessary to develop visual explanations that are not only faithful to the underlying model behavior but are also meaningfully aligned with the complexity of human understanding and inquiry.

Abstract: Multi-turn interaction remains challenging for online reinforcement learning. A common solution is trajectory-level optimization, which treats each trajectory as a single training sample. However, this approach can be inefficient and yield misleading learning signals: it applies uniform sampling across tasks regardless of difficulty, penalizes correct intermediate actions in failed trajectories, and incurs high sample-collection costs. To address these issues, we propose STEP (Success-rate-aware Trajectory-Efficient Policy optimization), a framework that dynamically allocates sampling based on per-task success rates and performs step-level optimization. STEP maintains a smoothed success-rate record to guide adaptive trajectory resampling, allocating more effort to harder tasks. It then computes success-rate-weighted advantages and decomposes trajectories into step-level samples. Finally, it applies a step-level GRPO augmentation to refine updates for low-success tasks. Experiments on OSWorld and AndroidWorld show that STEP substantially improves sample efficiency and training stability over trajectory-level GRPO, converging faster and generalizing better under the same sampling budget.

Abstract: Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.
  We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.

To tackle this problem, we propose \textbf{RePo}, a novel method that jointly encodes \textbf{Re}gion-wise and \textbf{Po}int-wise features to capture both spatial context and fine-grained moving patterns. For region-wise representation, the GPS trajectories are first mapped to grid sequences, and spatial context are captured by structural features and semantic context enriched by visual features. For point-wise representation, three lightweight expert networks extract local, correlation, and continuous movement patterns from dense GPS sequences. Then, a router network adaptively fuses the learned point-wise features, which are subsequently combined with region-wise features using cross-attention to produce the final trajectory embedding. To train RePo, we adopt a contrastive loss with hard negative samples to provide similarity ranking supervision. Experiment results show that RePo achieves an average accuracy improvement of 22.2\% over SOTA baselines across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in graph-based learning tasks, but their complex, non-linear operations often render them as opaque "black boxes". This opacity hinders user trust, complicates debugging, bias detection, and adoption in critical domains requiring explainability. This paper introduces InteractiveGNNExplainer, a visual analytics framework to enhance GNN explainability, focusing on node classification. Our system uniquely integrates coordinated interactive views (dynamic graph layouts, embedding projections, feature inspection, neighborhood analysis) with established post-hoc (GNNExplainer) and intrinsic (GAT attention) explanation techniques. Crucially, it incorporates interactive graph editing, allowing users to perform a "what-if" analysis by perturbing graph structures and observing immediate impacts on GNN predictions and explanations. We detail the system architecture and, through case studies on Cora and CiteSeer datasets, demonstrate how InteractiveGNNExplainer facilitates in-depth misclassification diagnosis, comparative analysis of GCN versus GAT behaviors, and rigorous probing of model sensitivity. These capabilities foster a deeper, multifaceted understanding of GNN predictions, contributing to more transparent, trustworthy, and robust graph analysis.

Abstract: The Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a classical scheduling problem that has received significant attention due to of its numerous applications in industry. However, in practice, task durations are subject to uncertainty that must be considered in order to propose resilient scheduling. In this paper, we address the RCPSP variant with uncertain tasks duration (modeled using known probabilities) and aim to minimize the overall expected project duration. Our objective is to produce a baseline schedule that can be reused multiple times in an industrial setting regardless of the actual duration scenario. We leverage Graph Neural Networks in conjunction with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an effective policy for task scheduling. This policy operates similarly to a priority dispatch rule and is paired with a Serial Schedule Generation Scheme to produce a schedule. Our empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates the approach's superiority in terms of performance and its ability to generalize. The developed framework, Wheatley, is made publicly available online to facilitate further research and reproducibility.

Abstract: The transformer architecture has demonstrated strong performance in classification tasks involving structured and high-dimensional data. However, its success often hinges on large- scale training data and careful regularization to prevent overfitting. In this paper, we intro- duce a novel likelihood-guided variational Ising-based regularization framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs), which simultaneously enhances model generalization and dynamically prunes redundant parameters. The proposed variational Ising-based regularization approach leverages Bayesian sparsification techniques to impose structured sparsity on model weights, allowing for adaptive architecture search during training. Unlike traditional dropout-based methods, which enforce fixed sparsity patterns, the variational Ising-based regularization method learns task-adaptive regularization, improving both efficiency and interpretability. We evaluate our approach on benchmark vision datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrating improved generalization under sparse, complex data and allowing for principled uncertainty quantification on both weights and selection parameters. Additionally, we show that the Ising regularizer leads to better-calibrated probability estimates and structured feature selection through uncertainty-aware attention mechanisms. Our results highlight the effectiveness of structured Bayesian sparsification in enhancing transformer-based architectures, offering a principled alternative to standard regularization techniques.

Abstract: This work presents a case study of a heterogeneous multiphysics solver from the nuclear fusion domain. At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping.

Abstract: Biomarker discovery from high-throughput transcriptomic data is crucial for advancing precision medicine. However, existing methods often neglect gene-gene regulatory relationships and lack stability across datasets, leading to conflation of spurious correlations with genuine causal effects. To address these issues, we develop a causal graph neural network (Causal-GNN) method that integrates causal inference with multi-layer graph neural networks (GNNs). The key innovation is the incorporation of causal effect estimation for identifying stable biomarkers, coupled with a GNN-based propensity scoring mechanism that leverages cross-gene regulatory networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistently high predictive accuracy across four distinct datasets and four independent classifiers. Moreover, it enables the identification of more stable biomarkers compared to traditional methods. Our work provides a robust, efficient, and biologically interpretable tool for biomarker discovery, demonstrating strong potential for broad application across medical disciplines.

Abstract: Acting in human environments is a crucial capability for general-purpose robots, necessitating a robust understanding of natural language and its application to physical tasks. This paper seeks to harness the capabilities of diffusion models within a visuomotor policy framework that merges visual and textual inputs to generate precise robotic trajectories. By employing reference demonstrations during training, the model learns to execute manipulation tasks specified through textual commands within the robot's immediate environment. The proposed research aims to extend an existing model by leveraging improved embeddings, and adapting techniques from diffusion models for image generation. We evaluate our methods on the CALVIN dataset, proving enhanced performance on various manipulation tasks and an increased long-horizon success rate when multiple tasks are executed in sequence. Our approach reinforces the usefulness of diffusion models and contributes towards general multitask manipulation.

Abstract: Generating thorough natural language explanations for threat detections remains an open problem in cybersecurity research, despite significant advances in automated malware detection systems. In this work, we present AutoMalDesc, an automated static analysis summarization framework that, following initial training on a small set of expert-curated examples, operates independently at scale. This approach leverages an iterative self-paced learning pipeline to progressively enhance output quality through synthetic data generation and validation cycles, eliminating the need for extensive manual data annotation. Evaluation across 3,600 diverse samples in five scripting languages demonstrates statistically significant improvements between iterations, showing consistent gains in both summary quality and classification accuracy. Our comprehensive validation approach combines quantitative metrics based on established malware labels with qualitative assessment from both human experts and LLM-based judges, confirming both technical precision and linguistic coherence of generated summaries. To facilitate reproducibility and advance research in this domain, we publish our complete dataset of more than 100K script samples, including annotated seed (0.9K) and test (3.6K) datasets, along with our methodology and evaluation framework.

Abstract: Diagrams are crucial yet underexplored tools in many disciplines, demonstrating the close connection between visual representation and scholarly reasoning. However, their iconic form poses obstacles to visual studies, intermedial analysis, and text-based digital workflows. In particular, Charles S. Peirce consistently advocated the use of diagrams as essential for reasoning and explanation. His manuscripts, often combining textual content with complex visual artifacts, provide a challenging case for studying documents involving heterogeneous materials. In this preliminary study, we investigate whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can effectively help us identify and interpret such hybrid pages in context. First, we propose a workflow that (i) segments manuscript page layouts, (ii) reconnects each segment to IIIF-compliant annotations, and (iii) submits fragments containing diagrams to a VLM. In addition, by adopting Peirce's semiotic framework, we designed prompts to extract key knowledge about diagrams and produce concise captions. Finally, we integrated these captions into knowledge graphs, enabling structured representations of diagrammatic content within composite sources.

Abstract: Improving energy efficiency in industrial foundry processes is a critical challenge, as these operations are highly energy-intensive and marked by complex interdependencies among process variables. Correlation-based analyses often fail to distinguish true causal drivers from spurious associations, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. This paper applies a time-series causal inference framework to identify the operational factors that directly affect energy efficiency in induction furnace melting. Using production data from a Danish foundry, the study integrates time-series clustering to segment melting cycles into distinct operational modes with the PCMCI+ algorithm, a state-of-the-art causal discovery method, to uncover cause-effect relationships within each mode. Across clusters, robust causal relations among energy consumption, furnace temperature, and material weight define the core drivers of efficiency, while voltage consistently influences cooling water temperature with a delayed response. Cluster-specific differences further distinguish operational regimes: efficient clusters are characterized by stable causal structures, whereas inefficient ones exhibit reinforcing feedback loops and atypical dependencies. The contributions of this study are twofold. First, it introduces an integrated clustering-causal inference pipeline as a methodological innovation for analyzing energy-intensive processes. Second, it provides actionable insights that enable foundry operators to optimize performance, reduce energy consumption, and lower emissions.

<title>Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits Without Sacrificing Expressibility</title>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.

Abstract: Open-domain question answering over datalakes requires retrieving and composing information from multiple tables, a challenging subtask that demands semantic relevance and structural coherence (e.g., joinability). While exact optimization methods like Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) can ensure coherence, their computational complexity is often prohibitive. Conversely, simpler greedy heuristics that optimize for query coverage alone often fail to find these coherent, joinable sets. This paper frames multi-table retrieval as an iterative search process, arguing this approach offers advantages in scalability, interpretability, and flexibility. We propose a general framework and a concrete instantiation: a fast, effective Greedy Join-Aware Retrieval algorithm that holistically balances relevance, coverage, and joinability. Experiments across 5 NL2SQL benchmarks demonstrate that our iterative method achieves competitive retrieval performance compared to the MIP-based approach while being 4-400x faster depending on the benchmark and search space settings. This work highlights the potential of iterative heuristics for practical, scalable, and composition-aware retrieval.

Abstract: Multimedia documents such as slide presentations and posters are designed to be interactive and easy to modify. Yet, they are often distributed in a static raster format, which limits editing and customization. Restoring their editability requires converting these raster images back into structured vector formats. However, existing geometric raster-vectorization methods, which rely on low-level primitives like curves and polygons, fall short at this task. Specifically, when applied to complex documents like slides, they fail to preserve the high-level structure, resulting in a flat collection of shapes where the semantic distinction between image and text elements is lost. To overcome this limitation, we address the problem of semantic document derendering by introducing SliDer, a novel framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to derender slide images as compact and editable Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) representations. SliDer detects and extracts attributes from individual image and text elements in a raster input and organizes them into a coherent SVG format. Crucially, the model iteratively refines its predictions during inference in a process analogous to human design, generating SVG code that more faithfully reconstructs the original raster upon rendering. Furthermore, we introduce Slide2SVG, a novel dataset comprising raster-SVG pairs of slide documents curated from real-world scientific presentations, to facilitate future research in this domain. Our results demonstrate that SliDer achieves a reconstruction LPIPS of 0.069 and is favored by human evaluators in 82.9% of cases compared to the strongest zero-shot VLM baseline.

Abstract: This study presents a systematic evaluation of time-frequency feature design for binaural sound source localization (SSL), focusing on how feature selection influences model performance across diverse conditions. We investigate the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using various combinations of amplitude-based features (magnitude spectrogram, interaural level difference - ILD) and phase-based features (phase spectrogram, interaural phase difference - IPD). Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain data with mismatched head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) reveal that carefully chosen feature combinations often outperform increases in model complexity. While two-feature sets such as ILD + IPD are sufficient for in-domain SSL, generalization to diverse content requires richer inputs combining channel spectrograms with both ILD and IPD. Using the optimal feature sets, our low-complexity CNN model achieves competitive performance. Our findings underscore the importance of feature design in binaural SSL and provide practical guidance for both domain-specific and general-purpose localization.

Abstract: Modern business and economic datasets often exhibit nonlinear, multi-scale structures that traditional linear tools under-represent. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a geometric lens for uncovering robust patterns, such as connected components, loops and voids, across scales. This paper provides an intuitive, figure-driven introduction to persistent homology and a practical, reproducible TDA pipeline for applied analysts. Through comparative case studies in consumer behavior, equity markets (SAX/eSAX vs.\ TDA) and foreign exchange dynamics, we demonstrate how topological features can reveal segmentation patterns and structural relationships beyond classical statistical methods. We discuss methodological choices regarding distance metrics, complex construction and interpretation, and we introduce the \textit{Topological Stability Index} (TSI), a simple yet interpretable indicator of structural variability derived from persistence lifetimes. We conclude with practical guidelines for TDA implementation, visualization and communication in business and economic analytics.

Abstract: Fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) has become a growing concern due to discriminatory outcomes in AI-based decision-making systems. While various methods have been proposed to mitigate bias, most rely on complete demographic information, an assumption often impractical due to legal constraints and the risk of reinforcing discrimination. This survey examines fairness in AI when demographics are incomplete, addressing the gap between traditional approaches and real-world challenges. We introduce a novel taxonomy of fairness notions in this setting, clarifying their relationships and distinctions. Additionally, we summarize existing techniques that promote fairness beyond complete demographics and highlight open research questions to encourage further progress in the field.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for deploying image classifiers in safety-sensitive environments, yet existing detectors often struggle when OOD samples are semantically similar to the in-distribution (ID) classes. We present BootOOD, a fully self-supervised OOD detection framework that bootstraps exclusively from ID data and is explicitly designed to handle semantically challenging OOD samples. BootOOD synthesizes pseudo-OOD features through simple transformations of ID representations and leverages Neural Collapse (NC), where ID features cluster tightly around class means with consistent feature norms. Unlike prior approaches that aim to constrain OOD features into subspaces orthogonal to the collapsed ID means, BootOOD introduces a lightweight auxiliary head that performs radius-based classification on feature norms. This design decouples OOD detection from the primary classifier and imposes a relaxed requirement: OOD samples are learned to have smaller feature norms than ID features, which is easier to satisfy when ID and OOD are semantically close. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-200 show that BootOOD outperforms prior post-hoc methods, surpasses training-based methods without outlier exposure, and is competitive with state-of-the-art outlier-exposure approaches while maintaining or improving ID accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce GS-PowerHP, a novel zeroth-order method for non-convex optimization problems of the form $\max_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} f(x)$. Our approach leverages two key components: a power-transformed Gaussian-smoothed surrogate $F_{N,\sigma}(\mu) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2 I_d)}[e^{N f(x)}]$ whose stationary points cluster near the global maximizer $x^*$ of $f$ for sufficiently large $N$, and an incrementally decaying $\sigma$ for enhanced data efficiency. Under mild assumptions, we prove convergence in expectation to a small neighborhood of $x^*$ with the iteration complexity of $O(d^2 \varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirical results show our approach consistently ranks among the top three across a suite of competing algorithms. Its robustness is underscored by the final experiment on a substantially high-dimensional problem ($d=150,528$), where it achieved first place on least-likely targeted black-box attacks against images from ImageNet, surpassing all competing methods.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc framework for uncertainty quantification that provides distribution-free coverage guarantees. However, these guarantees crucially rely on the assumption of exchangeability. This assumption is fundamentally violated in time series data, where temporal dependence and distributional shifts are pervasive. As a result, classical split-conformal methods may yield prediction intervals that fail to maintain nominal validity. This review unifies recent advances in conformal forecasting methods specifically designed to address nonexchangeable data. We first present a theoretical foundation, deriving finite-sample guarantees for split-conformal prediction under mild weak-dependence conditions. We then survey and classify state-of-the-art approaches that mitigate serial dependence by reweighting calibration data, dynamically updating residual distributions, or adaptively tuning target coverage levels in real time. Finally, we present a comprehensive simulation study that compares these techniques in terms of empirical coverage, interval width, and computational cost, highlighting practical trade-offs and open research directions.

Abstract: Deformable templates, or atlases, are images that represent a prototypical anatomy for a population, and are often enhanced with probabilistic anatomical label maps. They are commonly used in medical image analysis for population studies and computational anatomy tasks such as registration and segmentation. Because developing a template is a computationally expensive process, relatively few templates are available. As a result, analysis is often conducted with sub-optimal templates that are not truly representative of the study population, especially when there are large variations within this population. We propose a machine learning framework that uses convolutional registration neural networks to efficiently learn a function that outputs templates conditioned on subject-specific attributes, such as age and sex. We also leverage segmentations, when available, to produce anatomical segmentation maps for the resulting templates. The learned network can also be used to register subject images to the templates. We demonstrate our method on a compilation of 3D brain MRI datasets, and show that it can learn high-quality templates that are representative of populations. We find that annotated conditional templates enable better registration than their unlabeled unconditional counterparts, and outperform other templates construction methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-G\"odel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.

Abstract: Earth observation data presents a unique challenge: it is spatial like images, sequential like video or text, and highly multimodal. We present OlmoEarth: a multimodal, spatio-temporal foundation model that employs a novel self-supervised learning formulation, masking strategy, and loss all designed for the Earth observation domain. OlmoEarth achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 12 other foundation models across a variety of research benchmarks and real-world tasks from external partners. When evaluating embeddings OlmoEarth achieves the best performance on 15 out of 24 tasks, and with full fine-tuning it is the best on 19 of 29 tasks. We deploy OlmoEarth as the backbone of an end-to-end platform for data collection, labeling, training, and inference of Earth observation models. The OlmoEarth Platform puts frontier foundation models and powerful data management tools into the hands of non-profits and NGOs working to solve the world's biggest problems. OlmoEarth source code, training data, and pre-trained weights are available at $\href{https://github.com/allenai/olmoearth_pretrain}{\text{https://github.com/allenai/olmoearth_pretrain}}$.

<title>Why is "Chicago" Predictive of Deceptive Reviews? Using LLMs to Discover Language Phenomena from Lexical Cues</title>

Abstract: Deceptive reviews mislead consumers, harm businesses, and undermine trust in online marketplaces. Machine learning classifiers can learn from large amounts of training examples to effectively distinguish deceptive reviews from genuine ones. However, the distinguishing features learned by these classifiers are often subtle, fragmented, and difficult for humans to interpret. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLMs) to translate machine-learned lexical cues into human-understandable language phenomena that can differentiate deceptive reviews from genuine ones. We show that language phenomena obtained in this manner are empirically grounded in data, generalizable across similar domains, and more predictive than phenomena either in LLMs' prior knowledge or obtained through in-context learning. These language phenomena have the potential to aid people in critically assessing the credibility of online reviews in environments where deception detection classifiers are unavailable.

Abstract: Constructing abstract interpreters that provide global soundness guarantees remains a major obstacle in abstract interpretation. We investigate whether modern LLMs can reduce this burden by leveraging them to synthesize sound, non-trivial abstract interpreters across multiple abstract domains in the setting of neural network verification. We formulate synthesis as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel mathematically grounded cost function for measuring unsoundness under strict syntactic and semantic constraints. Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework not only matches the quality of handcrafted transformers, but more importantly, discovers sound, high-precision transformers for complex nonlinear operators that are absent from existing literature.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have outpaced the computational and memory capacities of edge platforms that primarily employ CPUs, thereby challenging efficient and scalable deployment. While ternary quantization enables significant resource savings, existing CPU solutions rely heavily on memory-based lookup tables (LUTs) which limit scalability, and FPGA or GPU accelerators remain impractical for edge use. This paper presents T-SAR, the first framework to achieve scalable ternary LLM inference on CPUs by repurposing the SIMD register file for dynamic, in-register LUT generation with minimal hardware modifications. T-SAR eliminates memory bottlenecks and maximizes data-level parallelism, delivering 5.6-24.5x and 1.1-86.2x improvements in GEMM latency and GEMV throughput, respectively, with only 3.2% power and 1.4% area overheads in SIMD units. T-SAR achieves up to 2.5-4.9x the energy efficiency of an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin, establishing a practical approach for efficient LLM inference on edge platforms.

<title>QUILL: An Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design for Cache-Local Deformable Attention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13679</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Deformable transformers deliver state-of-the-art detection but map poorly to hardware due to irregular memory access and low arithmetic intensity. We introduce QUILL, a schedule-aware accelerator that turns deformable attention into cache-friendly, single-pass work. At its core, Distance-based Out-of-Order Querying (DOOQ) orders queries by spatial proximity; the look-ahead drives a region prefetch into an alternate buffer--forming a schedule-aware prefetch loop that overlaps memory and compute. A fused MSDeformAttn engine executes interpolation, Softmax, aggregation, and the final projection (W''m) in one pass without spilling intermediates, while small tensors are kept on-chip and surrounding dense layers run on integrated GEMMs. Implemented as RTL and evaluated end-to-end, QUILL achieves up to 7.29x higher throughput and 47.3x better energy efficiency than an RTX 4090, and exceeds prior accelerators by 3.26-9.82x in throughput and 2.01-6.07x in energy efficiency. With mixed-precision quantization, accuracy tracks FP32 within <=0.9 AP across Deformable and Sparse DETR variants. By converting sparsity into locality--and locality into utilization--QUILL delivers consistent, end-to-end speedups.

<title>Training-Free Multi-View Extension of IC-Light for Textual Position-Aware Scene Relighting</title>

arXiv:2511.13684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GS-Light, an efficient, textual position-aware pipeline for text-guided relighting of 3D scenes represented via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication.

<title>Generalist Foundation Models Are Not Clinical Enough for Hospital Operations</title>

Abstract: Hospitals and healthcare systems rely on operational decisions that determine patient flow, cost, and quality of care. Despite strong performance on medical knowledge and conversational benchmarks, foundation models trained on general text may lack the specialized knowledge required for these operational decisions. We introduce Lang1, a family of models (100M-7B parameters) pretrained on a specialized corpus blending 80B clinical tokens from NYU Langone Health's EHRs and 627B tokens from the internet. To rigorously evaluate Lang1 in real-world settings, we developed the REalistic Medical Evaluation (ReMedE), a benchmark derived from 668,331 EHR notes that evaluates five critical tasks: 30-day readmission prediction, 30-day mortality prediction, length of stay, comorbidity coding, and predicting insurance claims denial. In zero-shot settings, both general-purpose and specialized models underperform on four of five tasks (36.6%-71.7% AUROC), with mortality prediction being an exception. After finetuning, Lang1-1B outperforms finetuned generalist models up to 70x larger and zero-shot models up to 671x larger, improving AUROC by 3.64%-6.75% and 1.66%-23.66% respectively. We also observed cross-task scaling with joint finetuning on multiple tasks leading to improvement on other tasks. Lang1-1B effectively transfers to out-of-distribution settings, including other clinical tasks and an external health system. Our findings suggest that predictive capabilities for hospital operations require explicit supervised finetuning, and that this finetuning process is made more efficient by in-domain pretraining on EHR. Our findings support the emerging view that specialized LLMs can compete with generalist models in specialized tasks, and show that effective healthcare systems AI requires the combination of in-domain pretraining, supervised finetuning, and real-world evaluation beyond proxy benchmarks.

<title>From Power to Precision: Learning Fine-grained Dexterity for Multi-fingered Robotic Hands</title>

Abstract: Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

<title>UnSAMv2: Self-Supervised Learning Enables Segment Anything at Any Granularity</title>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible masks, and collecting dense annotations across all granularities is prohibitively expensive, making supervised solutions infeasible. To address this limitation, we introduce UnSAMv2, which enables segment anything at any granularity without human annotations. UnSAMv2 extends the divide-and-conquer strategy of UnSAM by discovering abundant mask-granularity pairs and introducing a novel granularity control embedding that enables precise, continuous control over segmentation scale. Remarkably, with only $6$K unlabeled images and $0.02\%$ additional parameters, UnSAMv2 substantially enhances SAM-2, achieving segment anything at any granularity across interactive, whole-image, and video segmentation tasks. Evaluated on over $11$ benchmarks, UnSAMv2 improves $\text{NoC}_{90}$ (5.69 $\rightarrow$ 4.75), 1-IoU (58.0 $\rightarrow$ 73.1), and $\text{AR}_{1000}$ (49.6 $\rightarrow$ 68.3), showing that small amounts of unlabeled data with a granularity-aware self-supervised learning method can unlock the potential of vision foundation models.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.

Abstract: We present multi-point optimization: an optimization technique that allows to train several models simultaneously without the need to keep the parameters of each one individually. The proposed method is used for a thorough empirical analysis of the loss landscape of neural networks. By extensive experiments on FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets we demonstrate two things: 1) loss surface is surprisingly diverse and intricate in terms of landscape patterns it contains, and 2) adding batch normalization makes it more smooth. Source code to reproduce all the reported results is available on GitHub: https://github.com/universome/loss-patterns.

<title>Achieving Fairness with a Simple Ridge Penalty</title>

Abstract: In this paper we present a general framework for estimating regression models subject to a user-defined level of fairness. We enforce fairness as a model selection step in which we choose the value of a ridge penalty to control the effect of sensitive attributes. We then estimate the parameters of the model conditional on the chosen penalty value. Our proposal is mathematically simple, with a solution that is partly in closed form, and produces estimates of the regression coefficients that are intuitive to interpret as a function of the level of fairness. Furthermore, it is easily extended to generalised linear models, kernelised regression models and other penalties; and it can accommodate multiple definitions of fairness.
  We compare our approach with the regression model from Komiyama et al. (2018), which implements a provably-optimal linear regression model; and with the fair models from Zafar et al. (2019). We evaluate these approaches empirically on six different data sets, and we find that our proposal provides better goodness of fit and better predictive accuracy for the same level of fairness. In addition, we highlight a source of bias in the original experimental evaluation in Komiyama et al. (2018).

Abstract: Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) can perform algorithmic tasks such as sorting. However, they often fail to generalise to input sequence lengths not encountered during training. We introduce two approaches that constrain the state space of the MANN's controller network: state compression and state regularisation. We empirically demonstrated that both approaches can improve generalisation to input sequences of out-of-distribution lengths for a specific type of MANN: the differentiable neural computer (DNC). The constrained DNC could process input sequences that were up to 2.3 times longer than those processed by an unconstrained baseline controller network. Notably, the applied constraints enabled the extension of the DNC's memory matrix without the need for retraining and thus allowed the processing of input sequences that were 10.4 times longer. However, the improvements were not consistent across all tested algorithmic tasks. Interestingly, solutions that performed better often had a highly structured state space, characterised by state trajectories exhibiting increased curvature and loop-like patterns. Our experimental work demonstrates that state-space constraints can enable the training of a DNC using shorter input sequences, thereby saving computational resources and facilitating training when acquiring long sequences is costly.

Abstract: Deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Transformers, have shown great promise in a variety of applications, including image and speech synthesis, natural language processing, and drug discovery. However, when applied to engineering design problems, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging, as traditional statistical metrics based on likelihood may not fully capture the requirements of engineering applications. This paper doubles as a review and practical guide to evaluation metrics for deep generative models (DGMs) in engineering design. We first summarize the well-accepted `classic' evaluation metrics for deep generative models grounded in machine learning theory. Using case studies, we then highlight why these metrics seldom translate well to design problems but see frequent use due to the lack of established alternatives. Next, we curate a set of design-specific metrics which have been proposed across different research communities and can be used for evaluating deep generative models. These metrics focus on unique requirements in design and engineering, such as constraint satisfaction, functional performance, novelty, and conditioning. Throughout our discussion, we apply the metrics to models trained on simple-to-visualize 2-dimensional example problems. Finally, we evaluate four deep generative models on a bicycle frame design problem and structural topology generation problem. In particular, we showcase the use of proposed metrics to quantify performance target achievement, design novelty, and geometric constraints. We publicly release the code for the datasets, models, and metrics used throughout the paper at https://decode.mit.edu/projects/metrics/.

<title>CG-FedLLM: How to Compress Gradients in Federated Fune-tuning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The success of current Large-Language Models (LLMs) hinges on extensive training data that is collected and stored centrally, called Centralized Learning (CL). However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and one potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients, not raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs significant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study introduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve communication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named CG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire the compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to reconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that comprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify characteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved Fine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance (e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based fine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This improvement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can filter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore, we present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise ratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework, providing insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.

Abstract: We study the infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous space Lipschitz MDPs in which an agent can play policies from a given set $\Phi$. The proposed algorithms efficiently explore the policy space by ''zooming'' into the ''promising regions'' of $\Phi$, thereby achieving adaptivity gains in the performance. We upper bound their regret as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(T^{1 - d_{\text{eff.}}^{-1}}\big)$, where $d_{\text{eff.}} = d^\Phi_z+2$ for model-free algoritahm $\textit{PZRL-MF}$ and $d_{\text{eff.}} = 2d_\mathcal{S} + d^\Phi_z + 3$ for model-based algorithm $\textit{PZRL-MB}$. Here, $d_\mathcal{S}$ is the dimension of the state space, and $d^\Phi_z$ is the zooming dimension given a set of policies $\Phi$. $d^\Phi_z$ is an alternative measure of the complexity of the problem, and it depends on the underlying MDP as well as on $\Phi$. Hence, the proposed algorithms exhibit low regret in case the problem instance is benign and/or the agent competes against a low-complexity $\Phi$ (that has a small $d^\Phi_z$). When specialized to the case of finite-dimensional policy space, we obtain that $d_{\text{eff.}}$ scales as the dimension of this space under mild technical conditions; and also obtain $d_{\text{eff.}} = 2$, or equivalently $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for $\textit{PZRL-MF}$, under a curvature condition on the average reward function that is commonly used in the multi-armed bandit (MAB) literature.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of machine learning systems in critical real-world decision-making applications has highlighted the urgent need for counterfactual explainability methods that operate effectively. Global counterfactual explanations, expressed as actions to offer recourse, aim to provide succinct explanations and insights applicable to large population subgroups. High effectiveness, measured by the fraction of the population that is provided recourse, ensures that the actions benefit as many individuals as possible. Keeping the cost of actions low ensures the proposed recourse actions remain practical and actionable. Limiting the number of actions that provide global counterfactuals is essential to maximizing interpretability. The primary challenge, therefore, is to balance these trade-offs--maximizing effectiveness, minimizing cost, while maintaining a small number of actions. We introduce $\texttt{GLANCE}$, a versatile and adaptive algorithm that employs a novel agglomerative approach, jointly considering both the feature space and the space of counterfactual actions, thereby accounting for the distribution of points in a way that aligns with the model's structure. This design enables the careful balancing of the trade-offs among the three key objectives, with the size objective functioning as a tunable parameter to keep the actions few and easy to interpret. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that $\texttt{GLANCE}$ consistently shows greater robustness and performance compared to existing methods across various datasets and models.

Abstract: We present a critical survey on the consistency of uncertainty quantification used in deep learning and highlight partial uncertainty coverage and many inconsistencies. We then provide a comprehensive and statistically consistent framework for uncertainty quantification in deep learning that accounts for all major sources of uncertainty: input data, training and testing data, neural network weights, and machine-learning model imperfections, targeting regression problems. We systematically quantify each source by applying Bayes' theorem and conditional probability densities and introduce a fast, practical implementation method. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a simple regression problem and a real-world application: predicting cloud autoconversion rates using a neural network trained on aircraft measurements from the Azores and guided by a two-moment bin model of the stochastic collection equation. In this application, uncertainty from the training and testing data dominates, followed by input data, neural network model, and weight variability. Finally, we highlight the practical advantages of this methodology, showing that explicitly modeling training data uncertainty improves robustness to new inputs that fall outside the training data, and enhances model reliability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In many real-world applications of machine learning such as recommendations, hiring, and lending, deployed models influence the data they are trained on, leading to feedback loops between predictions and data distribution. The performative prediction (PP) framework captures this phenomenon by modeling the data distribution as a function of the deployed model. While prior work has focused on finding performative stable (PS) solutions for robustness, their societal impacts, particularly regarding fairness, remain underexplored. We show that PS solutions can lead to severe polarization and prediction performance disparities, and that conventional fairness interventions in previous works often fail under model-dependent distribution shifts due to failing the PS criteria. To address these challenges in PP, we introduce novel fairness mechanisms that provably ensure both stability and fairness, validated by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) have attracted attention recently as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for scientific machine learning. However, KANs can be expensive to train, even for relatively small networks. Inspired by finite basis physics-informed neural networks (FBPINNs), in this work, we develop a domain decomposition method for KANs that allows for several small KANs to be trained in parallel to give accurate solutions for multiscale problems. We show that finite basis KANs (FBKANs) can provide accurate results with noisy data and for physics-informed training.

Abstract: The symmetry of dynamical systems can be exploited for state-transition prediction and to facilitate control policy optimization. This paper leverages system symmetry to develop sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Under the symmetry assumption for a Markov Decision Process (MDP), a symmetric data augmentation method is proposed. The augmented samples are integrated into the dataset of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to enhance its coverage rate of the state-action space. Furthermore, sample utilization efficiency is improved by introducing a second critic trained on the augmented samples, resulting in a dual-critic structure. The aircraft's model is verified to be symmetric, and flight control simulations demonstrate accelerated policy convergence when augmented samples are employed.

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a Bayesian filtering method that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.

Abstract: Building on VeriX (Verified eXplainability, arXiv:2212.01051), a system for producing optimal verified explanations for machine learning models, we present VeriX+, which significantly improves both the size and the generation time of formal explanations. We introduce a bound propagation-based sensitivity technique to improve the size, and a binary search-based traversal with confidence ranking for improving time -- the two techniques are orthogonal and can be used independently or together. We also show how to adapt the QuickXplain algorithm to our setting to provide a trade-off between size and time. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements on both metrics, e.g., a size reduction of $38\%$ on the GTSRB dataset and a time reduction of $90\%$ on MNIST. We demonstrate that our approach is scalable to transformers and real-world scenarios such as autonomous aircraft taxiing and sentiment analysis. We conclude by showcasing several novel applications of formal explanations.

<title>Exploiting Missing Data Remediation Strategies using Adversarial Missingness Attacks</title>

Abstract: Adversarial Missingness (AM) attacks aim to manipulate model fitting by carefully engineering a missing data problem to achieve a specific malicious objective. AM attacks are significantly different from prior data poisoning attacks in that no malicious data inserted and no data is maliciously perturbed. Current AM attacks are feasible only under the assumption that the modeler (victim) uses full-information maximum likelihood methods to handle missingness. This work aims to remedy this limitation of AM attacks; in the approach taken here, the adversary achieves their goal by solving a bi-level optimization problem to engineer the adversarial missingness mechanism, where the lower level problem incorporates a differentiable approximation of the targeted missingness remediation technique. As instantiations of this framework, AM attacks are provided for three popular techniques: (i) complete case analysis, (ii) mean imputation, and (iii) regression-based imputation for general empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems. Experiments on real-world data show that AM attacks are successful with modest levels of missingness (less than 20%). Furthermore, we show on the real-world Twins dataset that AM attacks can manipulate the estimated average treatment effect (ATE) as an instance of the general ERM problems: the adversary succeeds in not only reversing the sign, but also in substantially inflating the ATE values from a true value of -1.61% to a manipulated one as high as 10%. These experimental results hold when the ATE is calculated using multiple regression-based estimators with different architectures, even when the adversary is restricted to modifying only a subset of the training data.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges related to communication efficiency and performance reduction when scaling to many clients. To address these issues, we explore the potential of using low-rank updates and provide the first theoretical study of rank properties in FL. Our theoretical analysis shows that a client's loss exhibits a higher-rank structure (i.e., gradients span higher-rank subspaces of the Hessian) compared to the server's loss, and that low-rank approximations of the clients' gradients have greater similarity. Based on this insight, we hypothesize that constraining client-side optimization to a low-rank subspace could provide an implicit regularization effect while reducing communication costs. Consequently, we propose FedLoRU, a general low-rank update framework for FL. Our framework enforces low-rank client-side updates and accumulates these updates to form a higher-rank model. We are able to establish convergence of the algorithm; the convergence rate matches FedAvg. Additionally, variants of FedLoRU can adapt to environments with statistical and model heterogeneity by employing multiple or hierarchical low-rank updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedLoRU performs comparably to full-rank algorithms and exhibits robustness to heterogeneous and large numbers of clients.

<title>Fira: Can We Achieve Full-rank Training of LLMs Under Low-rank Constraint?</title>

Abstract: Low-rank training has emerged as a promising approach for reducing memory usage in training Large Language Models (LLMs). Previous methods either rely on decomposing weight matrices (e.g., LoRA), or seek to decompose gradient matrices (e.g., GaLore) to ensure reduced memory consumption. However, both of them constrain the training in a low-rank subspace, thus inevitably leading to sub-optimal performance. This raises a question: whether it is possible to consistently preserve the low-rank constraint for memory efficiency, while achieving full-rank training (i.e., training with full-rank gradients of full-rank weights) to avoid inferior outcomes? In this paper, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework for LLMs called Fira, as the first attempt to achieve this goal. First, we observe an interesting phenomenon during LLM training: the scaling impact of adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) on the gradient norm remains similar from low-rank to full-rank training. Based on this observation, we propose a norm-based scaling method, which utilizes the scaling impact of low-rank optimizers as substitutes for that of original full-rank optimizers to enable full-rank training. In this way, we can preserve the low-rank constraint in the optimizer while achieving full-rank training for better performance. Moreover, we find that there are sudden gradient rises during the optimization process, potentially causing loss spikes. To address this, we further put forward a norm-growth limiter to smooth the gradient via regulating the relative increase of gradient norms. Extensive experiments on the pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs show that Fira outperforms both LoRA and GaLore, achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than full-rank training.

Abstract: Self-supervised graph representation learning (GRL) typically generates paired graph augmentations from each graph to infer similar representations for augmentations of the same graph, but distinguishable representations for different graphs. While effective augmentation requires both semantics-preservation and data-perturbation, most existing GRL methods focus solely on data-perturbation, leading to suboptimal solutions. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a novel method, Explanation-Preserving Augmentation (EPA), which leverages graph explanation for semantics-preservation. EPA first uses a small number of labels to train a graph explainer, which infers the subgraphs that explain the graph's label. Then these explanations are used for generating semantics-preserving augmentations for boosting self-supervised GRL. Thus, the entire process, namely EPA-GRL, is semi-supervised. We demonstrate theoretically, using an analytical example, and through extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets, that EPA-GRL outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) GRL methods that use semantics-agnostic augmentations. The code is available at https://github.com/realMoana/EPA-GRL.

Abstract: An intriguing property of the Transformer is its ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), where the Transformer can solve different inference tasks without parameter updating based on the contextual information provided by the corresponding input-output demonstration pairs. It has been theoretically proved that ICL is enabled by the capability of Transformers to perform gradient-descent algorithms (Von Oswald et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2024). This work takes a step further and shows that Transformers can perform learning-to-optimize (L2O) algorithms. Specifically, for the ICL sparse recovery (formulated as LASSO) tasks, we show that a K-layer Transformer can perform an L2O algorithm with a provable convergence rate linear in K. This provides a new perspective explaining the superior ICL capability of Transformers, even with only a few layers, which cannot be achieved by the standard gradient-descent algorithms. Moreover, unlike the conventional L2O algorithms that require the measurement matrix involved in training to match that in testing, the trained Transformer is able to solve sparse recovery problems generated with different measurement matrices. Besides, Transformers as an L2O algorithm can leverage structural information embedded in the training tasks to accelerate its convergence during ICL, and generalize across different lengths of demonstration pairs, where conventional L2O algorithms typically struggle or fail. Such theoretical findings are supported by our experimental results.

Abstract: To unlock access to stronger winds, the offshore wind industry is advancing towards significantly larger and taller wind turbines. This massive upscaling motivates a departure from wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate nonstationary kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high-dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from offshore wind energy areas in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.

Abstract: Conflicting explanations, arising from different attribution methods or model internals, limit the adoption of machine learning models in safety-critical domains. We turn this disagreement into an advantage and introduce EXplanation AGREEment (EXAGREE), a two-stage framework that selects a Stakeholder-Aligned Explanation Model (SAEM) from a set of similar-performing models. The selection maximizes Stakeholder-Machine Agreement (SMA), a single metric that unifies faithfulness and plausibility. EXAGREE couples a differentiable mask-based attribution network (DMAN) with monotone differentiable sorting, enabling gradient-based search inside the constrained model space. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate simultaneous gains of faithfulness, plausibility, and fairness over baselines, while preserving task accuracy. Extensive ablation studies, significance tests, and case studies confirm the robustness and feasibility of the method in practice.

Abstract: The emerging in-context learning (ICL) ability of large language models (LLMs) has prompted their use for predictive tasks in various domains with different data types, including tabular data, facilitated by serialization methods. However, with increasing applications in high-stakes domains, it has been shown that LLMs can inherit social bias and discrimination from their pre-training data. In this work, we investigate inherent bias in LLMs during in-context learning with tabular data. We focus on an optimal demonstration selection approach that utilizes latent concept variables for resource-efficient task adaptation. We design data augmentation strategies that reduce the correlation between predictive outcomes and sensitive variables, helping promote fairness during latent concept learning. We utilize the learned concept to select demonstrations and obtain fair predictions. The latent concept variables are learned using a smaller internal LLM and generalized to larger external LLMs. We empirically verify that the fair latent variable approach improves fairness results on tabular datasets compared to multiple heuristic demonstration selection methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for sequential decision-making, but its application is often hindered by privacy concerns arising from its interaction data. This challenge is particularly acute in advanced networked systems, where learning from operational and user data can expose systems to privacy inference attacks. Existing differential privacy (DP) models for RL are often inadequate: the centralized model requires a fully trusted server, creating a single point of failure risk, while the local model incurs significant performance degradation that is unsuitable for many networked applications. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the emerging shuffle model of privacy, an intermediate trust model that provides strong privacy guarantees without a centralized trust assumption. We present Shuffle Differentially Private Policy Elimination (SDP-PE), the first generic policy elimination-based algorithm for episodic RL under the shuffle model. Our method introduces a novel exponential batching schedule and a ``forgetting'' mechanism to balance the competing demands of privacy and learning performance. Our analysis shows that SDP-PE achieves a near-optimal regret bound, demonstrating a superior privacy-regret trade-off with utility comparable to the centralized model while significantly outperforming the local model. The numerical experiments also corroborate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of SDP-PE. This work establishes the viability of the shuffle model for secure data-driven decision-making in networked systems.

Abstract: Metacognition, defined as the awareness and regulation of one's cognitive processes, is central to human adaptability in unknown situations. In contrast, current autonomous agents often struggle in novel environments due to their limited capacity for adaptation. We hypothesize that metacognition is a critical missing ingredient in autonomous agents for the cognitive flexibility needed to tackle unfamiliar challenges. Given the broad scope of metacognitive abilities, we focus on competence awareness and strategy selection. To this end, we propose the Metacognition for Unknown Situations and Environments (MUSE) framework to integrate metacognitive processes of self-assessment and self-regulation into autonomous agents. We present two implementations of MUSE: one based on world modeling and another leveraging large language models (LLMs). Our system continually learns to assess its competence on a given task and uses this self-assessment to guide iterative cycles of strategy selection. MUSE agents demonstrate high competence awareness and significant improvements in self-regulation for solving novel, out-of-distribution tasks more effectively compared to model-based reinforcement learning and purely prompt-based LLM agent approaches. This work highlights the promise of approaches inspired by cognitive and neural systems in enabling autonomous agents to adapt to new environments while mitigating the heavy reliance on extensive training data and large models for the current models.

Abstract: Learning predictive models from high-dimensional sensory observations is fundamental for cyber-physical systems, yet the latent representations learned by standard world models lack physical interpretability. This limits their reliability, generalizability, and applicability to safety-critical tasks. We introduce Physically Interpretable World Models (PIWM), a framework that aligns latent representations with real-world physical quantities and constrains their evolution through partially known physical dynamics. Physical interpretability in PIWM is defined by two complementary properties: (i) the learned latent state corresponds to meaningful physical variables, and (ii) its temporal evolution follows physically consistent dynamics. To achieve this without requiring ground-truth physical annotations, PIWM employs weak distribution-based supervision that captures state uncertainty naturally arising from real-world sensing pipelines. The architecture integrates a VQ-based visual encoder, a transformer-based physical encoder, and a learnable dynamics model grounded in known physical equations. Across three case studies (Cart Pole, Lunar Lander, and Donkey Car), PIWM achieves accurate long-horizon prediction, recovers true system parameters, and significantly improves physical grounding over purely data-driven models. These results demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of learning physically interpretable world models directly from images under weak supervision.

Abstract: Deep clustering is an essential task in modern artificial intelligence, aiming to partition a set of data samples into a given number of homogeneous groups (i.e., clusters). Recent studies have proposed increasingly advanced deep neural networks and training strategies for deep clustering, effectively improving performance. However, deep clustering generally remains challenging due to the inadequacy of supervision signals. Building upon the existing representation learning backbones, this paper proposes a novel clustering strategy of gradual community detection. It initializes clustering by partitioning samples into many pseudo-communities and then gradually expands clusters by community merging. Compared with the existing clustering strategies, community detection factors in the new perspective of cluster network analysis in the clustering process. The new perspective can effectively leverage global structural characteristics to enhance cluster pseudo-label purity, which is critical to the performance of self-supervision. We have implemented the proposed approach based on the popular backbones and evaluated its efficacy on benchmark image datasets. Our extensive experiments have shown that the proposed clustering strategy can effectively improve the SOTA performance. Our ablation study also demonstrates that the new network perspective can effectively improve community pseudo-label purity, resulting in improved self-supervision.

Abstract: Crafting adversarial examples is crucial for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), presenting a challenge equivalent to maximizing a non-differentiable 0-1 loss function.
  However, existing single objective methods, namely adversarial attacks focus on a surrogate loss function, do not fully harness the benefits of engaging multiple loss functions, as a result of insufficient understanding of their synergistic and conflicting nature.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose the Multi-Objective Set-based Attack (MOS Attack), a novel adversarial attack framework leveraging multiple loss functions and automatically uncovering their interrelations.
  The MOS Attack adopts a set-based multi-objective optimization strategy, enabling the incorporation of numerous loss functions without additional parameters.
  It also automatically mines synergistic patterns among various losses, facilitating the generation of potent adversarial attacks with fewer objectives.
  Extensive experiments have shown that our MOS Attack outperforms single-objective attacks. Furthermore, by harnessing the identified synergistic patterns, MOS Attack continues to show superior results with a reduced number of loss functions. Our code is available at https://github.com/pgg3/MOS-Attack.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the parameter counts of Large Language Models (LLMs), which often reach into the billions or even trillions, presents significant challenges for their practical deployment, particularly in resource-constrained environments. To address this issue, we propose PIP (Perturbation-based Iterative Pruning), a novel double-view structured pruning method to optimize LLMs, which combines information from two different views: the unperturbed view and the perturbed view. With the calculation of gradient differences, PIP iteratively prunes those that struggle to distinguish between these two views. Our experiments show that PIP reduces the parameter count by approximately 20% while retaining over 85% of the original model's accuracy across varied benchmarks. In some cases, the performance of the pruned model is within 5% of the unpruned version, demonstrating PIP's ability to preserve key aspects of model effectiveness. Moreover, PIP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) structured pruning methods, establishing it as a leading technique for optimizing LLMs in constrained environments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has gained significant attention in contemporary applications, particularly due to the scarcity of labeled data. While existing SSL methodologies primarily address feature variance and linear correlations, they often neglect the intricate relations between samples and the nonlinear dependencies inherent in complex data--especially prevalent in high-dimensional visual data. In this paper, we introduce Correlation-Dependence Self-Supervised Learning (CDSSL), a novel framework that unifies and extends existing SSL paradigms by integrating both linear correlations and nonlinear dependencies, encapsulating sample-wise and feature-wise interactions. Our approach incorporates the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to robustly capture nonlinear dependencies within a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, enriching representation learning. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CDSSL in improving representation quality.

Abstract: Municipal inspections are an important part of maintaining the quality of goods and services. In this paper, we approach the problem of intelligently scheduling service inspections to maximize their impact, using the case of food establishment inspections in Chicago as a case study. The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) inspects thousands of establishments each year, with a substantial fail rate (over 3,000 failed inspection reports in 2023). To balance the objectives of ensuring adherence to guidelines, minimizing disruption to establishments, and minimizing inspection costs, CDPH assigns each establishment an inspection window every year and guarantees that they will be inspected exactly once during that window. Meanwhile, CDPH also promises surprise public health inspections for unexpected food safety emergencies or complaints. These constraints create a challenge for a restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) approach, for which there are no existing methods. We develop an extension to Whittle index-based systems for RMABs that can guarantee action window constraints and frequencies, and furthermore can be leveraged to optimize action window assignments themselves. Briefly, we combine MDP reformulation and integer programming-based lookahead to maximize the impact of inspections subject to constraints. A neural network-based supervised learning model is developed to model state transitions of real Chicago establishments using public CDPH inspection records, which demonstrates 10% AUC improvements compared with directly predicting establishments' failures. Our experiments not only show up to 24% (in simulation) or 33% (on real data) objective improvements resulting from our approach and robustness to surprise inspections, but also give insight into the impact of scheduling constraints.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for online learning in Stackelberg general-sum games, where two agents, the leader and follower, engage in sequential turn-based interactions. At the core of this approach is a learned diffeomorphism that maps the joint action space to a smooth spherical Riemannian manifold, referred to as the Stackelberg manifold. This mapping, facilitated by neural normalizing flows, ensures the formation of tractable isoplanar subspaces, enabling efficient techniques for online learning. Leveraging the linearity of the agents' reward functions on the Stackelberg manifold, our construct allows the application of linear bandit algorithms. We then provide a rigorous theoretical basis for regret minimization on the learned manifold and establish bounds on the simple regret for learning Stackelberg equilibrium. This integration of manifold learning into game theory uncovers a previously unrecognized potential for neural normalizing flows as an effective tool for multi-agent learning. We present empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to standard baselines, with applications spanning domains such as cybersecurity and economic supply chain optimization.

Abstract: Training large neural network models requires extensive computational resources, often distributed across several nodes and accelerators. Recent findings suggest that it may be sufficient to only exchange the fast moving components of the gradients, while accumulating momentum locally (Decoupled Momentum, or DeMo). However, DeMo assumes that models fit on a single accelerator. We relax this assumption and introduce FlexDeMo, whereby nodes fully shard model parameters locally between different accelerators, while inter-node communication is reduced by synchronizing only fast-moving components instead of the full gradients -- resulting in a hybrid sharded data parallel training strategy. We further introduce a framework, denoted as DeToNATION, that generalizes DeMo, FlexDeMo, and other popular distributed training schemes such as DiLoCo -- introducing new variations of replication schemes and challenging choices made in DeMo. Our results across language and vision domains show that FlexDeMo attains similar validation loss as hybrid sharded data parallel training employing AdamW and full gradient synchronization, while being substantially faster. FlexDeMo is thus a promising distributed training scheme for the largest machine learning models.

Abstract: In recent studies of emotional EEG classification, connectivity matrices have been successfully employed as input to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can effectively consider inter-regional interaction patterns in EEG. However, we find that such an approach has a limitation that important patterns in connectivity matrices may be lost during the convolutional operations in CNNs. To resolve this issue, we propose and validate an idea to upscale the connectivity matrices to strengthen the local patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that this simple idea can significantly enhance the classification performance.

Abstract: Estimating individualised treatment effect (ITE) -- that is the causal effect of a set of variables (also called exposures, treatments, actions, policies, or interventions), referred to as \textit{composite treatments}, on a set of outcome variables of interest, referred to as \textit{composite outcomes}, for a unit from observational data -- remains a fundamental problem in causal inference with applications across disciplines, such as healthcare, economics, education, social science, marketing, and computer science. Previous work in causal machine learning for ITE estimation is limited to simple settings, like single treatments and single outcomes. This hinders their use in complex real-world scenarios; for example, consider studying the effect of different ICU interventions, such as beta-blockers and statins for a patient admitted for heart surgery, on different outcomes of interest such as atrial fibrillation and in-hospital mortality. The limited research into composite treatments and outcomes is primarily due to data scarcity for all treatments and outcomes. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel and innovative hypernetwork-based approach, called \emph{H-Learner}, to solve ITE estimation under composite treatments and composite outcomes, which tackles the data scarcity issue by dynamically sharing information across treatments and outcomes. Our empirical analysis with binary and arbitrary composite treatments and outcomes demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization has emerged as a technique for addressing a wide range of machine learning problems that involve an outer objective implicitly determined by the minimizer of an inner problem. While prior works have primarily focused on the parametric setting, a learning-theoretic foundation for bilevel optimization in the nonparametric case remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we take a first step toward bridging this gap by studying Kernel Bilevel Optimization (KBO), where the inner objective is optimized over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This setting enables rich function approximation while providing a foundation for rigorous theoretical analysis. In this context, we derive novel finite-sample generalization bounds for KBO, leveraging tools from empirical process theory. These bounds further allow us to assess the statistical accuracy of gradient-based methods applied to the empirical discretization of KBO. We numerically illustrate our theoretical findings on a synthetic instrumental variable regression task.

Abstract: Multi-objective multi-armed bandit (MO-MAB) problems traditionally aim to achieve Pareto optimality. However, real-world scenarios often involve users with varying preferences across objectives, resulting in a Pareto-optimal arm that may score high for one user but perform quite poorly for another. This highlights the need for customized learning, a factor often overlooked in prior research. To address this, we study a preference-aware MO-MAB framework in the presence of explicit user preference. It shifts the focus from achieving Pareto optimality to further optimizing within the Pareto front under preference-centric customization. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study of customized MO-MAB optimization with explicit user preferences. Motivated by practical applications, we explore two scenarios: unknown preference and hidden preference, each presenting unique challenges for algorithm design and analysis. At the core of our algorithms are preference estimation and preference-aware optimization mechanisms to adapt to user preferences effectively. We further develop novel analytical techniques to establish near-optimal regret of the proposed algorithms. Strong empirical performance confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Calibration is a fundamental concept that aims at ensuring the reliability of probabilistic predictions by aligning them with real-world outcomes. There is a surge of studies on new calibration measures that are easier to optimize compared to the classical $\ell_1$-Calibration while still having strong implications for downstream applications. One recent such example is the work by Fishelson et al. (2025) who show that it is possible to achieve $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo $\ell_2$-Calibration error via minimizing pseudo swap regret of the squared loss, which in fact implies the same bound for all bounded proper losses with a smooth univariate form. In this work, we significantly generalize their result in the following ways: (a) in addition to smooth univariate forms, our algorithm also simultaneously achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ swap regret for any proper loss with a twice continuously differentiable univariate form (such as Tsallis entropy); (b) our bounds hold not only for pseudo swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's distributions on predictions, but also hold for the actual swap regret that measures losses using the forecaster's actual realized predictions.
  We achieve so by introducing a new stronger notion of calibration called (pseudo) KL-Calibration, which we show is equivalent to the (pseudo) swap regret for log loss. We prove that there exists an algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ KL-Calibration error and provide an explicit algorithm that achieves $O(T^{1/3})$ pseudo KL-Calibration error. Moreover, we show that the same algorithm achieves $O(T^{1/3}(\log T)^{-1/3}\log(T/\delta))$ swap regret w.p. $\ge 1-\delta$ for any proper loss with a smooth univariate form, which implies $O(T^{1/3})$ $\ell_2$-Calibration error. A technical contribution of our work is a new randomized rounding procedure and a non-uniform discretization scheme to minimize the swap regret for log loss.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to protect sensitive data during the training of machine learning models, but its privacy guarantee often comes at a large cost of model performance due to the lack of tight theoretical bounds quantifying privacy loss. While recent efforts have achieved more accurate privacy guarantees, they still impose some assumptions prohibited from practical applications, such as convexity and complex parameter requirements, and rarely investigate in-depth the impact of privacy mechanisms on the model's utility. In this paper, we provide a rigorous privacy characterization for DPSGD with general L-smooth and non-convex loss functions, revealing converged privacy loss with iteration in bounded-domain cases. Specifically, we track the privacy loss over multiple iterations, leveraging the noisy smooth-reduction property, and further establish comprehensive convergence analysis in different scenarios. In particular, we show that for DPSGD with a bounded domain, (i) the privacy loss can still converge without the convexity assumption, (ii) a smaller bounded diameter can improve both privacy and utility simultaneously under certain conditions, and (iii) the attainable big-O order of the privacy utility trade-off for DPSGD with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC) and for DPSGD-GC with bounded domain (DPSGD-DC) and mu-strongly convex population risk function, respectively. Experiments via membership inference attack (MIA) in a practical setting validate insights gained from the theoretical results.

Abstract: Tasks are central in machine learning, as they are the most natural objects to assess the capabilities of current models. The trend is to build general models able to address any task. Even though transfer learning and multitask learning try to leverage the underlying task space, no well-founded tools are available to study its structure. This study proposes a theoretically grounded setup to define the notion of task and to compute the {\bf inclusion} between two tasks from a statistical deficiency point of view. We propose a tractable proxy as information sufficiency to estimate the degree of inclusion between tasks, show its soundness on synthetic data, and use it to reconstruct empirically the classic NLP pipeline.

Abstract: While deep generative models have significantly advanced representation learning, they may inherit or amplify biases and fairness issues by encoding sensitive attributes alongside predictive features. Enforcing strict independence in disentanglement is often unrealistic when target and sensitive factors are naturally correlated. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CAD-VAE} (\textbf{C}orrelation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{D}isentangled \textbf{VAE}), which introduces a correlated latent code to capture the information shared between the target and sensitive attributes. Given this correlated latent, our method effectively separates overlapping factors without extra domain knowledge by directly minimizing the conditional mutual information between target and sensitive codes. A relevance-driven optimization strategy refines the correlated code by efficiently capturing essential correlated features and eliminating redundancy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAD-VAE produces fairer representations, realistic counterfactuals, and improved fairness-aware image editing.

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, even when their classes are not fully shared. Few dedicated UniDA methods exist for Time Series (TS), which remains a challenging case. In general, UniDA approaches align common class samples and detect unknown target samples from emerging classes. Such detection often results from thresholding a discriminability metric. The threshold value is typically either a fine-tuned hyperparameter or a fixed value, which limits the ability of the model to adapt to new data. Furthermore, discriminability metrics exhibit overconfidence for unknown samples, leading to misclassifications. This paper introduces UniJDOT, an optimal-transport-based method that accounts for the unknown target samples in the transport cost. Our method also proposes a joint decision space to improve the discriminability of the detection module. In addition, we use an auto-thresholding algorithm to reduce the dependence on fixed or fine-tuned thresholds. Finally, we rely on a Fourier transform-based layer inspired by the Fourier Neural Operator for better TS representation. Experiments on TS benchmarks demonstrate the discriminability, robustness, and state-of-the-art performance of UniJDOT.

Abstract: In many practical reinforcement learning tasks, feedback is only provided at the end of a long horizon, leading to sparse and delayed rewards. Existing reward redistribution methods typically assume that per-step rewards are independent, thus overlooking interdependencies among state-action pairs. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process based Likelihood Reward Redistribution (GP-LRR) framework that addresses this issue by modeling the reward function as a sample from a Gaussian process, which explicitly captures dependencies between state-action pairs through the kernel function. By maximizing the likelihood of the observed episodic return via a leave-one-out strategy that leverages the entire trajectory, our framework inherently introduces uncertainty regularization. Moreover, we show that conventional mean-squared-error (MSE) based reward redistribution arises as a special case of our GP-LRR framework when using a degenerate kernel without observation noise. When integrated with an off-policy algorithm such as Soft Actor-Critic, GP-LRR yields dense and informative reward signals, resulting in superior sample efficiency and policy performance on several MuJoCo benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-horizon planning is crucial in complex environments, but diffusion-based planners like Diffuser are limited by the trajectory lengths observed during training. This creates a dilemma: long trajectories are needed for effective planning, yet they degrade model performance. In this paper, we introduce this extendable long-horizon planning challenge and propose a two-phase solution. First, Progressive Trajectory Extension incrementally constructs longer trajectories through multi-round compositional stitching. Second, the Hierarchical Multiscale Diffuser enables efficient training and inference over long horizons by reasoning across temporal scales. To avoid the need for multiple separate models, we propose Adaptive Plan Pondering and the Recursive HM-Diffuser, which unify hierarchical planning within a single model. Experiments show our approach yields strong performance gains, advancing scalable and efficient decision-making over long-horizons.

Abstract: Training large foundation models costs hundreds of millions of dollars, making deployment optimization critical. Current approaches require machine learning engineers to manually craft training recipes through error-prone trial-and-error on expensive compute clusters. To enable efficient exploration of training configurations, researchers have developed performance modeling systems. However, these systems force users to translate their workloads into custom specification languages, introducing a fundamental semantic gap between the actual workload and its representation. This gap creates an inherent tradeoff: systems must either support a narrow set of workloads to maintain usability, require complex specifications that limit practical adoption, or compromise prediction accuracy with simplified performance models.
  We present Maya, a performance modeling system that eliminates these tradeoffs through transparent device emulation. By operating at the narrow interface between training frameworks and accelerator devices, Maya can capture complete workload behavior without requiring code modifications or translations. Maya intercepts device API calls from unmodified training code to directly observe low-level operations, enabling accurate performance prediction while maintaining both ease of use and generality. Our evaluation shows Maya achieves less than 5% prediction error across diverse models and optimization strategies, identifying configurations that reduce training costs by up to 56% compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the LLM instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's memory in the concurrent KV cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's memory. Hogwild! Inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and environment-robust alternative to vision-based sensing, enabling human motion analysis in challenging conditions such as low light, occlusions, rain, or smoke. However, its sparse point clouds pose significant challenges for semantic understanding. We present RadarLLM, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for human motion understanding from radar signals. RadarLLM introduces two key innovations: (1) a motion-guided radar tokenizer based on our Aggregate VQ-VAE architecture, integrating deformable body templates and masked trajectory modeling to convert spatial-temporal radar sequences into compact semantic tokens; and (2) a radar-aware language model that establishes cross-modal alignment between radar and text in a shared embedding space. To overcome the scarcity of paired radar-text data, we generate a realistic radar-text dataset from motion-text datasets with a physics-aware synthesis pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that RadarLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, enabling robust and interpretable motion understanding under privacy and visibility constraints, even in adverse environments. This paper has been accepted for presentation at AAAI 2026. This is an extended version with supplementary materials.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced weather forecasting, but accurate predictions first require identifying the current state of the atmosphere from observational data. In this work, we introduce Appa, a score-based data assimilation model generating global atmospheric trajectories at 0.25\si{\degree} resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 565M-parameter latent diffusion model trained on ERA5, Appa can be conditioned on arbitrary observations to infer plausible trajectories, without retraining. Our probabilistic framework handles reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting, within a single model, producing physically consistent reconstructions from various inputs. Results establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for future global atmospheric modeling systems.

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, identifying effective reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs.
  In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode, specifically in the context of cellular reprogramming. To solve it, we devise GATTACA, a scalable computational framework.
  To facilitate scalability of our framework, we consider previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and improve the procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. We then incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolution operations into the artificial neural network approximator of the DRL agent's action-value function. This allows us to leverage the available knowledge on the structure of a biological system and to indirectly, yet effectively, encode the system's modelled dynamics into a latent representation.
  Experiments on several large-scale, real-world biological networks from the literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The performance of Visio-Language Transformers drops sharply when an input modality (e.g., image) is missing, because the model is forced to make predictions using incomplete information. Existing missing-aware prompt methods help reduce this degradation, but they still rely on conventional prediction heads (e.g., a Fully-Connected layer) that compute class scores in the same way regardless of which modality is present or absent. We introduce Decoupled Prototype Learning (DPL), a new prediction head architecture that explicitly adjusts its decision process to the observed input modalities. For each class, DPL selects a set of prototypes specific to the current missing-modality cases (image-missing, text-missing, or mixed-missing). Each prototype is then decomposed into image-specific and text-specific components, enabling the head to make decisions that depend on the information actually present. This adaptive design allows DPL to handle inputs with missing modalities more effectively while remaining fully compatible with existing prompt-based frameworks. Extensive experiments on MM-IMDb, UPMC Food-101, and Hateful Memes demonstrate that DPL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all widely used multimodal imag-text datasets and various missing cases.

Abstract: The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is crucial in key areas such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy. However, achieving accurate and practical predictions is challenging due to two main factors. First, the inherent irregularity and data missingness in irregular time series make modeling difficult. Second, most existing methods are typically complex and resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a general framework called APN to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that achieves adaptive patching. By learning dynamically adjustable patch boundaries and a time-aware weighted averaging strategy, TAPA transforms the original irregular sequences into high-quality, regularized representations in a channel-independent manner. Additionally, we use a simple query module to effectively integrate historical information while maintaining the model's efficiency. Finally, predictions are made by a shallow MLP. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that APN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

Abstract: We study identifiability of stochastic differential equations (SDE) under multiple interventions. Our results give the first provable bounds for unique recovery of SDE parameters given samples from their stationary distributions. We give tight bounds on the number of necessary interventions for linear SDEs, and upper bounds for nonlinear SDEs in the small noise regime. We experimentally validate the recovery of true parameters in synthetic data, and motivated by our theoretical results, demonstrate the advantage of parameterizations with learnable activation functions in application to gene regulatory dynamics.

Abstract: Causal reasoning and discovery, two fundamental tasks of causal analysis, often face challenges in applications due to the complexity, noisiness, and high-dimensionality of real-world data. Despite recent progress in identifying latent causal structures using causal representation learning (CRL), what makes learned representations useful for causal downstream tasks and how to evaluate them are still not well understood. In this paper, we reinterpret CRL using a measurement model framework, where the learned representations are viewed as proxy measurements of the latent causal variables. Our approach clarifies the conditions under which learned representations support downstream causal reasoning and provides a principled basis for quantitatively assessing the quality of representations using a new Test-based Measurement EXclusivity (T-MEX) score. We validate T-MEX across diverse causal inference scenarios, including numerical simulations and real-world ecological video analysis, demonstrating that the proposed framework and corresponding score effectively assess the identification of learned representations and their usefulness for causal downstream tasks.

Abstract: Long-term, high-fidelity simulation of slow-changing physical systems, such as the ocean and climate, presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. Traditional autoregressive machine learning models often fail in these tasks as minor errors accumulate and lead to rapid forecast degradation. To address this problem, we propose NeuralOM, a general neural operator framework designed for simulating complex, slow-changing dynamics. NeuralOM's core consists of two key innovations: (1) a Progressive Residual Correction Framework that decomposes the forecasting task into a series of fine-grained refinement steps, effectively suppressing long-term error accumulation; and (2) a Physics-Guided Graph Network whose built-in adaptive messaging mechanism explicitly models multi-scale physical interactions, such as gradient-driven flows and multiplicative couplings, thereby enhancing physical consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate NeuralOM on the challenging task of global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralOM not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecast accuracy and long-term stability, but also excels in simulating extreme events. For instance, at a 60-day lead time, NeuralOM achieves a 13.3% lower RMSE compared to the best-performing baseline, offering a stable, efficient, and physically-aware paradigm for data-driven scientific computing.

Abstract: Resource-constrained weight deployment is a task of immense practical importance. Recently, there has been interest in the specific task of \textit{Delta Compression}, where parties each hold a common base model and only communicate compressed weight updates. However, popular parameter efficient updates such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) face inherent representation limitations - which are especially pronounced when combined with aggressive quantization. To overcome this, we build on recent work that improves LoRA representation capacity by using fixed-frequency sinusoidal functions to increase stable rank without adding additional parameters. We extend this to the quantized setting and present the first theoretical analysis showing how stable rank evolves under quantization. From this, we introduce SineLoRA$\Delta$, a principled and effective method for delta compression that improves the expressivity of quantized low-rank adapters by applying a sinusoidal activation. We validate SineLoRA$\Delta$ across a diverse variety of domains - including language modeling, vision-language tasks, and text-to-image generation - achieving up to 66% memory reduction with similar performance. We additionally provide a novel application of the canonical Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta metric to consistently compare adapter compression changes across the rate-distortion curve.

<title>Mitigating Overthinking in Large Reasoning Models via Manifold Steering</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, these models frequently exhibit a phenomenon known as overthinking during inference, characterized by excessive validation loops and redundant deliberation, leading to substantial computational overheads. In this paper, we aim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the tendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in the model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the activations along this direction. However, this efficacy soon reaches a plateau and even deteriorates as the intervention strength increases. We therefore systematically explore the activation space and find that the overthinking phenomenon is actually tied to a low-dimensional manifold, which indicates that the limited effect stems from the noises introduced by the high-dimensional steering direction. Based on this insight, we propose Manifold Steering, a novel approach that elegantly projects the steering direction onto the low-dimensional activation manifold given the theoretical approximation of the interference noise. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 distilled models validate that our method reduces output tokens by up to 71% while maintaining and even improving the accuracy on several mathematical benchmarks. Our method also exhibits robust cross-domain transferability, delivering consistent token reduction performance in code generation and knowledge-based QA tasks.

Abstract: This paper shows that generative diffusion processes converge to associative memory systems at vanishing noise levels and characterizes the stability, robustness, memorization, and generation dynamics of both model classes. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery, chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM, GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that, GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative mechanisms of CLMs.

Abstract: Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a new theoretical framework to understand PE's practical behavior and identify sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive datasets with $n$ data points from a convex and compact domain, we prove that under the right hyperparameter settings and given access to the Gaussian variation API proposed in \cite{PE23}, PE produces an $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein distance $\tilde{O}(d(n\varepsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original; this establishes worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the Private Signed Measure Mechanism, a method for DP synthetic data generation that has thus far not seen much practical adoption. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our theoretical findings in experiments.

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. MetaTT enables flexible and parameter-efficient model adaptation by using a single shared TT to factorize transformer sub-modules. This factorization indexes key structural dimensions, including layer and matrix type, and can optionally incorporate heads and tasks. This design allows MetaTT's parameter count to scale with the sum, rather than the product, of the modes, resulting in a substantially more compact adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning methods. We observe that when tested on single-task standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT achieves competitive parameter efficiency to accuracy tradeoff. We further demonstrate that MetaTT performs competitively when compared to state-of-the-art methods on multi-task learning. Finally, we leverage the TT-ansatz to design a rank adaptive optimizer inspired by the DMRG method from many-body physics. Our results demonstrate that integrating this approach with AdamW enhances optimization performance for a specified target rank.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of the map.

Abstract: Elastic Decision Transformers (EDTs) have proved to be particularly successful in offline reinforcement learning, offering a flexible framework that unifies sequence modeling with decision-making under uncertainty. Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus, carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy. In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency. We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity, codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical advantages.

Abstract: Assortment optimization seeks to select a subset of substitutable products, subject to constraints, to maximize expected revenue. The problem is NP-hard due to its combinatorial and nonlinear nature and arises frequently in industries such as e-commerce, where platforms must solve thousands of such problems each minute. We propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) framework to efficiently solve constrained assortment optimization problems. Our approach constructs a graph representation of the problem, trains a GCN to learn the mapping from problem parameters to optimal assortments, and develops three inference policies based on the GCN's output. Owing to the GCN's ability to generalize across instance sizes, patterns learned from small-scale samples can be transferred to large-scale problems. Numerical experiments show that a GCN trained on instances with 20 products achieves over 85% of the optimal revenue on problems with up to 2,000 products within seconds, outperforming existing heuristics in both accuracy and efficiency. We further extend the framework to settings with an unknown choice model using transaction data and demonstrate similar performance and scalability.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has shown effectiveness in exploiting shared information across tasks to improve generalization. MTL assumes tasks share similarities that can improve performance. In addition, boosting algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems, primarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and iteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for learning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve tasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which do not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate the performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose Robust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that explicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB structures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning shared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with regularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This architecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks while promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method integrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing robust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers knowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task individually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These results highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB in challenging MTL environments.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten", allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to "unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven traffic TSEP.

<title>State of Health Estimation of Batteries Using a Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence-Inverted Transformer</title>

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical. Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems, yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles. This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating, posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health (SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs, transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly. To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT). TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below 0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time settings. In this paper, we propose a streaming kernel-induced progressively generated expert framework of Gaussian processes (SkyGP) that addresses both computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts, while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>What One Cannot, Two Can: Two-Layer Transformers Provably Represent Induction Heads on Any-Order Markov Chains</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a hallmark capability of transformers, through which trained models learn to adapt to new tasks by leveraging information from the input context. Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to the presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence between induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling sequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of model depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can efficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart cannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher order Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three layers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a two-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In this paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer transformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional k-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the interplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this, we further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction, focusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating how effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together, these results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and illustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL capabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.

<title>Conditional Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Fusion: Overcoming Shortcut Learning in Sarcasm Detection</title>

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut learning.

<title>STA-GANN: A Valid and Generalizable Spatio-Temporal Kriging Approach</title>

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i) Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii) Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior performance of STA-GANN.

<title>Few-shot Class-incremental Fault Diagnosis by Preserving Class-Agnostic Knowledge with Dual-Granularity Representations</title>

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Fault Diagnosis (FSC-FD), which aims to continuously learn from new fault classes with only a few samples without forgetting old ones, is critical for real-world industrial systems. However, this challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity Representations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN explicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a fine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order Interaction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific features from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation stream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared across all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a multi-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained knowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting and alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a decoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision boundary bias caused by data imbalance. Extensive experiments on the TEP benchmark and a real-world MFF dataset demonstrate that our proposed DGGN achieves superior diagnostic performance and stability compared to state-of-the-art FSC-FD approaches.

Abstract: Quantization offers a practical solution to deploy LLMs in resource-constraint environments. However, its impact on internal representations remains understudied, raising questions about the reliability of quantized models. In this study, we employ a range of interpretability techniques to investigate how quantization affects model and neuron behavior. We analyze multiple LLMs under 4-bit and 8-bit quantization. Our findings reveal that the impact of quantization on model calibration is generally minor. Analysis of neuron activations indicates that the number of dead neurons, i.e., those with activation values close to 0 across the dataset, remains consistent regardless of quantization. In terms of neuron contribution to predictions, we observe that smaller full precision models exhibit fewer salient neurons, whereas larger models tend to have more, with the exception of Llama-2-7B. The effect of quantization on neuron redundancy varies across models. Overall, our findings suggest that effect of quantization may vary by model and tasks, however, we did not observe any drastic change which may discourage the use of quantization as a reliable model compression technique.

<title>PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context. We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS, demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets, compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets, highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark, we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer practical questions on forecasts.

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning models hold significant potential for predicting in-hospital mortality, yet data privacy constraints and the statistical heterogeneity of real-world clinical data often hamper their development. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but its performance under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) and imbalanced conditions requires rigorous investigation. The study presents a comparative benchmark of five federated learning strategies: FedAvg, FedProx, FedAdagrad, FedAdam, and FedCluster for mortality prediction. Using the large-scale MIMIC-IV dataset, we simulate a realistic non-IID environment by partitioning data by clinical care unit. To address the inherent class imbalance of the task, the SMOTE-Tomek technique is applied to each client's local training data. Our experiments, conducted over 50 communication rounds, reveal that the regularization-based strategy, FedProx, consistently outperformed other methods, achieving the highest F1-Score of 0.8831 while maintaining stable convergence. While the baseline FedAvg was the most computationally efficient, its predictive performance was substantially lower. Our findings indicate that regularization-based FL algorithms like FedProx offer a more robust and effective solution for heterogeneous and imbalanced clinical prediction tasks than standard or server-side adaptive aggregation methods. The work provides a crucial empirical benchmark for selecting appropriate FL strategies for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: We investigate imbalanced regression with tabular data that have an imbalance ratio larger than 1,000 ("highly imbalanced"). Accurately estimating the target values of rare instances is important in applications such as forecasting the intensity of rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For regression, the MSE loss does not consider the correlation between predicted and actual values. Typical inverse importance functions allow only convex functions. Uniform sampling might yield mini-batches that do not have rare instances. We propose CISIR that incorporates correlation, Monotonically Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling. Based on five datasets, our experimental results indicate that CISIR can achieve lower error and higher correlation than some recent methods. Also, adding our correlation component to other recent methods can improve their performance. Lastly, MDI importance can outperform other importance functions. Our code can be found in https://github.com/Machine-Earning/CISIR.

Abstract: Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection, they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score, outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.

Abstract: Machine-learned coarse-grained (CG) potentials are fast, but degrade over time when simulations reach under-sampled bio-molecular conformations, and generating widespread all-atom (AA) data to combat this is computationally infeasible. We propose a novel active learning (AL) framework for CG neural network potentials in molecular dynamics (MD). Building on the CGSchNet model, our method employs root mean squared deviation (RMSD)-based frame selection from MD simulations in order to generate data on-the-fly by querying an oracle during the training of a neural network potential. This framework preserves CG-level efficiency while correcting the model at precise, RMSD-identified coverage gaps. By training CGSchNet, a coarse-grained neural network potential, we empirically show that our framework explores previously unseen configurations and trains the model on unexplored regions of conformational space. Our active learning framework enables a CGSchNet model trained on the Chignolin protein to achieve a 33.05\% improvement in the Wasserstein-1 (W1) metric in Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) space on an in-house benchmark suite.

Abstract: Post-training fundamentally alters the behavior of large language models (LLMs), yet its impact on the internal parameter space remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two consistent and unexpected structural changes:(1) a near-uniform geometric scaling of singular values across layers, which theoretically modulates attention scores; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Disrupting this orthogonal consistency leads to catastrophic performance degradation. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective framework that interprets post-training as a reparameterization of fixed subspaces in the pretrained parameter space. Further experiments reveal that singular value scaling behaves as a secondary effect, analogous to a temperature adjustment, whereas the core functional transformation lies in the coordinated rotation of singular vectors. These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper investigation into model parameter changes.

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes. HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free learning.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge: how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex, neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh, ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark dataset. Its real-world applicability is confirmed by case studies on difficult targets like KRAS G12D (7XKJ). Additionally, the MSIB and MHCA modules prove transferable, boosting the performance of GraphDTA on standard drug target affinity prediction benchmarks (Davis and Kiba).

Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of mastering extrapolation.

Abstract: Effective Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) represents a key aspect for reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated decision-making and beyond. Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice structure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline given by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved performance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear regression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear models, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous one. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the global uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of distributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme.

<title>On Powerful Ways to Generate: Autoregression, Diffusion, and Beyond</title>

Abstract: Diffusion language models have recently emerged as a competitive alternative to autoregressive language models. Beyond next-token generation, they are more efficient and flexible by enabling parallel and any-order token generation. However, despite empirical successes, their computational power and fundamental limitations remain poorly understood. In this paper, we formally study whether non-autoregressive generation in Masked Diffusion Models (MDM) enables solving problems beyond the reach of Auto-Regressive Models (ARM). Our results show that MDM with sufficiently large context length is computationally universal with decoding steps matching the optimal parallel time complexity in PRAM. However, when controlling for other factors, MDM's flexibility to generate in any-order does not expand what ARM can already solve. To address this, we propose a new form of generation called any-process generation, which extends MDM with capabilities to remask, insert and delete tokens, allowing self-correction, length-variable editing, and adaptive parallelism. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate these capabilities enable scalability to significantly harder reasoning problems that are otherwise intractable for ARM and vanilla MDM. Additionally, they prove essential for generation tasks where objects naturally evolve through non-sequential processes, crucial for extending current LLMs beyond natural language to domains such as coding and science.

<title>On the Fairness of Privacy Protection: Measuring and Mitigating the Disparity of Group Privacy Risks for Differentially Private Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in DPML.

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-tuned large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

<title>Learning at the Speed of Physics: Equilibrium Propagation on Oscillator Ising Machines</title>

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning, and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform their optimization.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the $H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail, and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

<title>3D Optimization for AI Inference Scaling: Balancing Accuracy, Cost, and Latency</title>

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning pass) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., accuracy vs. compute), which fail to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling environment-adaptive selection of the inference scaling~$k$. Results show that knee-point optimization based on Pareto frontiers achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization remains favorable when accuracy is prioritized. Our results further show that smaller models, when combined with optimal inference scaling, can match or exceed the performance of larger models at a fraction of the cost. The framework establishes a theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse operational conditions.

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the performance of the an aggregate model overall.

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil. This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional profiles, school indicators, and principal management profiles. A comparative analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities between schools.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on AoU data demonstrates the model's predictive value for the onset of various conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom classification tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility and efficiency. This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction, proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$ circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative modeling.

Abstract: Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal mechanisms.

Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional physical systems but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders and constructing brain functional connectivity networks by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations, treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations. To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/XXYY20221234/Ada-FCN.

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications, our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

Abstract: AI models are often evaluated based on their ability to predict the outcome of interest. However, in many AI for social impact applications, the presence of an intervention that affects the outcome can bias the evaluation. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly assign interventions, allowing data from the control group to be used for unbiased model evaluation. However, this approach is inefficient because it ignores data from the treatment group. Given the complexity and cost often associated with RCTs, making the most use of the data is essential. Thus, we investigate model evaluation strategies that leverage all data from an RCT. First, we theoretically quantify the estimation bias that arises from na\"ively aggregating performance estimates from treatment and control groups and derive the condition under which this bias leads to incorrect model selection. Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose nuisance parameter weighting (NPW), an unbiased model evaluation approach that reweights data from the treatment group to mimic the distributions of samples that would or would not experience the outcome under no intervention. Using synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed evaluation approach consistently yields better model selection than the standard approach, which ignores data from the treatment group, across various intervention effect and sample size settings. Our contribution represents a meaningful step towards more efficient model evaluation in real-world contexts.

Abstract: Chemical reaction prediction remains a fundamental challenge in organic chemistry, where existing machine learning models face two critical limitations: sensitivity to input permutations (molecule/atom orderings) and inadequate modeling of substructural interactions governing reactivity. These shortcomings lead to inconsistent predictions and poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReaDISH, a novel reaction prediction model that learns permutation-invariant representations while incorporating interaction-aware features. It introduces two innovations: (1) symmetric difference shingle encoding, which extends the differential reaction fingerprint (DRFP) by representing shingles as continuous high-dimensional embeddings, capturing structural changes while eliminating order sensitivity; and (2) geometry-structure interaction attention, a mechanism that models intra- and inter-molecular interactions at the shingle level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaDISH improves reaction prediction performance across diverse benchmarks. It shows enhanced robustness with an average improvement of 8.76% on R$^2$ under permutation perturbations.

Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental task in graph machine learning with applications, ranging from social recommendation to knowledge graph completion. Fairness in this setting is critical, as biased predictions can exacerbate societal inequalities. Prior work adopts a dyadic definition of fairness, enforcing fairness through demographic parity between intra-group and inter-group link predictions. However, we show that this dyadic framing can obscure underlying disparities across subgroups, allowing systemic biases to go undetected. Moreover, we argue that demographic parity does not meet desired properties for fairness assessment in ranking-based tasks such as link prediction. We formalize the limitations of existing fairness evaluations and propose a framework that enables a more expressive assessment. Additionally, we propose a lightweight post-processing method combined with decoupled link predictors that effectively mitigates bias and achieves state-of-the-art fairness-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.

Abstract: Deploying continuous-control reinforcement learning policies on embedded hardware requires meeting tight latency and power budgets. Small FPGAs can deliver these, but only if costly floating point pipelines are avoided. We study quantization-aware training (QAT) of policies for integer inference and we present a learning-to-hardware pipeline that automatically selects low-bit policies and synthesizes them to an Artix-7 FPGA. Across five MuJoCo tasks, we obtain policy networks that are competitive with full precision (FP32) policies but require as few as 3 or even only 2 bits per weight, and per internal activation value, as long as input precision is chosen carefully. On the target hardware, the selected policies achieve inference latencies on the order of microseconds and consume microjoules per action, favorably comparing to a quantized reference. Last, we observe that the quantized policies exhibit increased input noise robustness compared to the floating-point baseline.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition (FER) is a fine-grained problem where the value of transfer learning is often assumed. We first quantify this assumption and show that, on AffectNet, training from random initialization with sufficiently strong augmentation consistently matches or surpasses fine-tuning from ImageNet. Motivated by this result, we propose Hybrid Multi-Task Learning (HMTL) for FER in the wild. HMTL augments supervised learning (SL) with self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives during training, while keeping the inference-time model unchanged. We instantiate HMTL with two tailored pretext tasks, puzzling and inpainting with a perceptual loss, that encourage part-aware and expression-relevant features. On AffectNet, both HMTL variants achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the eight-emotion setting without any additional pretraining data, and they provide larger gains under low-data regimes. Compared with conventional SSL pretraining, HMTL yields stronger downstream performance. Beyond FER, the same strategy improves fine-grained facial analysis tasks, including head pose estimation and gender recognition. These results suggest that aligned SSL auxiliaries are an effective and simple way to strengthen supervised fine-grained facial representation without adding extra computation cost during inference time.

Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential of revolutionizing natural language processing tasks in diverse domains, sparking great interest in finance. Accessing high-quality financial data is the first challenge for financial LLMs (FinLLMs). While proprietary models like BloombergGPT have taken advantage of their unique data accumulation, such privileged access calls for an open-source alternative to democratize Internet-scale financial data.
  In this paper, we present an open-source large language model, FinGPT, for the finance sector. Unlike proprietary models, FinGPT takes a data-centric approach, providing researchers and practitioners with accessible and transparent resources to develop their FinLLMs. We highlight the importance of an automatic data curation pipeline and the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique in building FinGPT. Furthermore, we showcase several potential applications as stepping stones for users, such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development. Through collaborative efforts within the open-source AI4Finance community, FinGPT aims to stimulate innovation, democratize FinLLMs, and unlock new opportunities in open finance. Two associated code repos are https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT and https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinNLP

<title>Foundations of Structural Causal Models with Latent Selection</title>

Abstract: Three distinct phenomena complicate statistical causal analysis: latent common causes, causal cycles, and latent selection. Foundational works on Structural Causal Models (SCMs), e.g., Bongers et al. (2021, Ann. Stat., 49(5): 2885-2915), treat cycles and latent variables, while an analogous account of latent selection is missing. The goal of this article is to develop a theoretical foundation for modeling latent selection with SCMs. To achieve that, we introduce a conditioning operation for SCMs: it maps an SCM with explicit selection mechanisms to one without them while preserving the causal semantics of the selected subpopulation. Graphically, in Directed Mixed Graphs we extend bidirected edge--beyond latent common cause--to also encode latent selection. We prove that the conditioning operation preserves simplicity, acyclicity, and linearity of SCMs, and interacts well with marginalization, conditioning, and interventions. These properties make those three operations valuable tools for causal modeling, reasoning, and learning after abstracting away latent details (latent common causes and selection). Examples show how this abstraction streamlines analysis and clarifies when standard tools (e.g., adjustment, causal calculus, instrumental variables) remain valid under selection bias. We hope that these results deepen the SCM-based understanding of selection bias and become part of the standard causal modeling toolbox to build more reliable causal analysis.

Abstract: While the field of medical image analysis has undergone a transformative shift with the integration of machine learning techniques, the main challenge of these techniques is often the scarcity of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. Medical images vary in format, size, and other parameters and therefore require extensive preprocessing and standardization, for usage in machine learning. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Medical Imaging Meta-Dataset (MedIMeta), a novel multi-domain, multi-task meta-dataset. MedIMeta contains 19 medical imaging datasets spanning 10 different domains and encompassing 54 distinct medical tasks, all of which are standardized to the same format and readily usable in PyTorch or other ML frameworks. We perform a technical validation of MedIMeta, demonstrating its utility through fully supervised and cross-domain few-shot learning baselines.

Abstract: Motivated by understanding the behavior of the Alternating Mirror Descent (AMD) algorithm for bilinear zero-sum games, we study the discretization of continuous-time Hamiltonian flow via the symplectic Euler method. We provide a framework for analysis using results from Hamiltonian dynamics, Lie algebra, and symplectic numerical integrators, with an emphasis on the existence and properties of a conserved quantity, the modified Hamiltonian (MH), for the symplectic Euler method. We compute the MH in closed-form when the original Hamiltonian is a quadratic function, and show that it generally differs from the other conserved quantity known previously in that case. We derive new error bounds on the MH when truncated at orders in the stepsize in terms of the number of iterations, $K$, and use these bounds to show an improved $\mathcal{O}(K^{1/5})$ total regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(K^{-4/5})$ duality gap of the average iterates for AMD. Finally, we propose a conjecture which, if true, would imply that the total regret for AMD scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{\varepsilon}\right)$ and the duality gap of the average iterates as $\mathcal{O}\left(K^{-1+\varepsilon}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon>0$, and we can take $\varepsilon=0$ upon certain convergence conditions for the MH.

<title>Causality Pursuit from Heterogeneous Environments via Neural Adversarial Invariance Learning</title>

Abstract: Pursuing causality from data is a fundamental problem in scientific discovery, treatment intervention, and transfer learning. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic method for addressing nonparametric invariance and causality learning in regression models across multiple environments, where the joint distribution of response variables and covariates varies, but the conditional expectations of outcome given an unknown set of quasi-causal variables are invariant. The challenge of finding such an unknown set of quasi-causal or invariant variables is compounded by the presence of endogenous variables that have heterogeneous effects across different environments. The proposed Focused Adversarial Invariant Regularization (FAIR) framework utilizes an innovative minimax optimization approach that drives regression models toward prediction-invariant solutions through adversarial testing. Leveraging the representation power of neural networks, FAIR neural networks (FAIR-NN) are introduced for causality pursuit. It is shown that FAIR-NN can find the invariant variables and quasi-causal variables under a minimal identification condition and that the resulting procedure is adaptive to low-dimensional composition structures in a non-asymptotic analysis. Under a structural causal model, variables identified by FAIR-NN represent pragmatic causality and provably align with exact causal mechanisms under conditions of sufficient heterogeneity. Computationally, FAIR-NN employs a novel Gumbel approximation with decreased temperature and a stochastic gradient descent ascent algorithm. The procedures are demonstrated using simulated and real-data examples.

Abstract: Parametrized and random unitary (or orthogonal) $n$-qubit circuits play a central role in quantum information. As such, one could naturally assume that circuits implementing symplectic transformations would attract similar attention. However, this is not the case, as $\mathbb{SP} d/2)$ -- the group of $d\times d$ unitary symplectic matrices -- has thus far been overlooked. In this work, we aim at starting to fill this gap. We begin by presenting a universal set of generators $\mathcal{G}$ for the symplectic algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(d/2)$, consisting of one- and two-qubit Pauli operators acting on neighboring sites in a one-dimensional lattice. Here, we uncover two critical differences between such set, and equivalent ones for unitary and orthogonal circuits. Namely, we find that the operators in $\mathcal{G}$ cannot generate arbitrary local symplectic unitaries and that they are not translationally invariant. We then review the Schur-Weyl duality between the symplectic group and the Brauer algebra, and use tools from Weingarten calculus to prove that Pauli measurements at the output of Haar random symplectic circuits can converge to Gaussian processes. As a by-product, such analysis provides us with concentration bounds for Pauli measurements in circuits that form $t$-designs over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$. To finish, we present tensor-network tools to analyze shallow random symplectic circuits, and we use these to numerically show that computational-basis measurements anti-concentrate at logarithmic depth.

arXiv:2406.11281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study data-driven learning of robust stochastic control for infinite-horizon systems with potentially continuous state and action spaces. In many managerial settings--supply chains, finance, manufacturing, services, and dynamic games--the state-transition mechanism is determined by system design, while available data capture the distributional properties of the stochastic inputs from the environment. For modeling and computational tractability, a decision maker often adopts a Markov control model with i.i.d. environment inputs, which can render learned policies fragile to internal dependence or external perturbations. We introduce a distributionally robust stochastic control paradigm that promotes policy reliability by introducing adaptive adversarial perturbations to the environment input, while preserving the modeling, statistical, and computational tractability of the Markovian formulation. From a modeling perspective, we examine two adversary models--current-action-aware and current-action-unaware--leading to distinct dynamic behaviors and robust optimal policies. From a statistical learning perspective, we characterize optimal finite-sample minimax rates for uniform learning of the robust value function across a continuum of states under ambiguity sets defined by the $f_k$-divergence and Wasserstein distance. To efficiently compute the optimal robust policies, we further propose algorithms inspired by deep reinforcement learning methodologies. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real managerial problems.

<title>Emulation with uncertainty quantification of regional sea-level change caused by the Antarctic Ice Sheet</title>

Abstract: Projecting sea-level change in various climate-change scenarios typically involves running forward simulations of the Earth's gravitational, rotational and deformational (GRD) response to ice mass change, which requires high computational cost and time. Here we build neural-network emulators of sea-level change at 27 coastal locations, due to the GRD effects associated with future Antarctic Ice Sheet mass change over the 21st century. The emulators are based on datasets produced using a numerical solver for the static sea-level equation and published ISMIP6-2100 ice-sheet model simulations referenced in the IPCC AR6 report. We show that the neural-network emulators have an accuracy that is competitive with baseline machine learning emulators. In order to quantify uncertainty, we derive well-calibrated prediction intervals for simulated sea-level change via a linear regression postprocessing technique that uses (nonlinear) machine learning model outputs, a technique that has previously been applied to numerical climate models. We also demonstrate substantial gains in computational efficiency: a feedforward neural-network emulator exhibits on the order of 100 times speedup in comparison to the numerical sea-level equation solver that is used for training.

<title>Using Linearized Optimal Transport to Predict the Evolution of Stochastic Particle Systems</title>

arXiv:2408.01857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an Euler-type method to predict the evolution of a time-dependent probability measure without explicitly learning an operator that governs its evolution. We use linearized optimal transport theory to prove that the measure-valued analog of Euler's method is first-order accurate when the measure evolves ``smoothly.'' In applications of interest, however, the measure is an empirical distribution of a system of stochastic particles whose behavior is only accessible through an agent-based micro-scale simulation. In such cases, this empirical measure does not evolve smoothly because the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales. However, we can still perform our Euler-type method, and when the particles' collective distribution approximates a measure that \emph{does} evolve smoothly, we observe that the algorithm still accurately predicts this collective behavior over relatively large Euler steps, thus reducing the number of micro-scale steps required to step forward in time. In this way, our algorithm provides a ``macro-scale timestepper'' that requires less micro-scale data to still maintain accuracy, which we demonstrate with three illustrative examples: a biological agent-based model, a model of a PDE, and a model of Langevin dynamics.

Abstract: Autonomous machine learning research has gained significant attention recently. We present MLR-COPILOT, an autonomous Machine Learning Research framework powered by large language model agents. The system is designed to enhance ML research productivity through automatic generation and implementation of research ideas within constraints. Our work was released in August 2024 (concurrent to AI-Scientist) and has gained notable recognition from leading projects. We further enhance our ideation with training afterwards. The framework consists of three stages: idea generation, experiment implementation, and code execution. First, existing research papers are used to generate feasible ideas and experiment plans with IdeaAgent, powered by an RL-tuned LLM. Next, ExperimentAgent leverages retrieved prototype code to convert plans into executable code with optionally retrieved candidate models and data from HuggingFace. In the final stage, ExperimentAgent runs experiments, and allows subsequent iterations of debugging and human feedback for a better chance of success with executable outcomes. We evaluate our framework on five machine learning research tasks. Experiment results demonstrate the potential of our framework to facilitate ML research progress and innovation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pruning have shown state-of-the-art (SotA) compression results in post-training and retraining-free settings while maintaining high predictive performance. However, previous research mainly considered calibrating based on English text, despite the multilingual nature of modern LLMs and their frequent use in non-English languages. This analysis paper conducts an in-depth investigation of the performance and internal representation changes associated with pruning multilingual language models for monolingual applications. We present the first comprehensive empirical study, comparing different calibration languages for pruning multilingual models across diverse languages, tasks, models, and SotA pruning techniques. We further analyze the latent subspaces, pruning masks, and individual neurons within pruned models. Our results reveal that while calibration on the target language effectively retains perplexity and yields high signal-to-noise ratios, it does not consistently improve downstream task performance. Further analysis of internal representations at three different levels highlights broader limitations of current pruning approaches: While they effectively preserve dominant information like language-specific features, this is insufficient to counteract the loss of nuanced, language-agnostic features that are crucial for knowledge retention and reasoning.

Abstract: The gaming industry has experienced substantial growth, but cheating in online games poses a significant threat to the integrity of the gaming experience. Cheating, particularly in first-person shooter (FPS) games, can lead to substantial losses for the game industry. Existing anti-cheat solutions have limitations, such as client-side hardware constraints, security risks, server-side unreliable methods, and both-sides suffer from a lack of comprehensive real-world datasets. To address these limitations, the paper proposes HAWK, a server-side FPS anti-cheat framework for the popular game CS:GO. HAWK utilizes machine learning techniques to mimic human experts' identification process, leverages novel multi-view features, and it is equipped with a well-defined workflow. The authors evaluate HAWK with the first large and real-world datasets containing multiple cheat types and cheating sophistication, and it exhibits promising efficiency and acceptable overheads, shorter ban times compared to the in-use anti-cheat, a significant reduction in manual labor, and the ability to capture cheaters who evaded official inspections.

arXiv:2410.20595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.

arXiv:2410.22303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work aims to minimize interaction in secure computation due to the high cost and challenges associated with communication rounds, particularly in scenarios with many clients. In this work, we revisit the problem of secure aggregation in the single-server setting where a single evaluation server can securely aggregate client-held individual inputs. Our key contribution is the introduction of One-shot Private Aggregation ($\mathsf{OPA}$) where clients speak only once (or even choose not to speak) per aggregation evaluation. Since each client communicates only once per aggregation, this simplifies managing dropouts and dynamic participation, contrasting with multi-round protocols and aligning with plaintext secure aggregation, where clients interact only once. We construct $\mathsf{OPA}$ based on LWR, LWE, class groups, DCR and demonstrate applications to privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) where clients \emph{speak once}. This is a sharp departure from prior multi-round FL protocols whose study was initiated by Bonawitz et al. (CCS, 2017). Moreover, unlike the YOSO (You Only Speak Once) model for general secure computation, $\mathsf{OPA}$ eliminates complex committee selection protocols to achieve adaptive security. Beyond asymptotic improvements, $\mathsf{OPA}$ is practical, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions. We benchmark logistic regression classifiers for two datasets, while also building an MLP classifier to train on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. We build two flavors of $\caps$ (1) from (threshold) key homomorphic PRF and (2) from seed homomorphic PRG and secret sharing.

Abstract: The concept of world models has garnered significant attention due to advancements in multimodal large language models such as GPT-4 and video generation models such as Sora, which are central to the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the literature on world models. Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including generative games, autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects. Finally, we outline key challenges and provide insights into potential future research directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/World-Model.

Abstract: We present a quantum-inspired algorithm that utilizes Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) for efficient community detection. Our approach reformulates the community detection task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and QHD is deployed to identify optimal community structures. We implement a multi-level algorithm that iteratively refines community assignments by alternating between QUBO problem setup and QHD-based optimization. Benchmarking shows our method achieves up to 5.49\% better modularity scores while requiring less computational time compared to classical optimization approaches. This work demonstrates the potential of hybrid quantum-inspired solutions for advancing community detection in large-scale graph data.

Abstract: We compare the performance of randomized classical and quantum neural networks (NNs) as well as classical and quantum-classical hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the task of supervised binary image classification. We keep the employed quantum circuits compatible with near-term quantum devices and use two distinct methodologies: applying randomized NNs on dimensionality-reduced data and applying CNNs to full image data. We evaluate these approaches on three fully-classical data sets of increasing complexity: an artificial hypercube data set, MNIST handwritten digits and industrial images. Our central goal is to shed more light on how quantum and classical models perform for various binary classification tasks and on what defines a good quantum model. Our study involves a correlation analysis between classification accuracy and quantum model hyperparameters, and an analysis on the role of entanglement in quantum models, as well as on the impact of initial training parameters. We find classical and quantum-classical hybrid models achieve statistically-equivalent classification accuracies across most data sets with no approach consistently outperforming the other. Interestingly, we observe that quantum NNs show lower variance with respect to initial training parameters and that the role of entanglement is nuanced. While incorporating entangling gates seems advantageous, we also observe the (optimizable) entangling power not to be correlated with model performance. We also observe an inverse proportionality between the number of entangling gates and the average gate entangling power. Our study provides an industry perspective on quantum machine learning for binary image classification tasks, highlighting both limitations and potential avenues for further research in quantum circuit design, entanglement utilization, and model transferability across varied applications.

<title>Time-Series-Informed Closed-loop Learning for Sequential Decision Making and Control</title>

arXiv:2412.02423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-loop performance of sequential decision making algorithms, such as model predictive control, depends strongly on the choice of controller parameters. Bayesian optimization allows learning of parameters from closed-loop experiments, but standard Bayesian optimization treats this as a black-box problem and ignores the temporal structure of closed-loop trajectories, leading to slow convergence and inefficient use of experimental resources. We propose a time-series-informed multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization framework that aligns the fidelity dimension with closed-loop time, enabling intermediate performance evaluations within a closed-loop experiment to be incorporated as lower-fidelity observations. Additionally, we derive probabilistic early stopping criteria to terminate unpromising closed-loop experiments based on the surrogate model's posterior belief, avoiding full episodes for poor parameterizations and thereby reducing resource usage. Simulation results on a nonlinear control benchmark demonstrate that, compared to standard black-box Bayesian optimization approaches, the proposed method achieves comparable closed-loop performance with roughly half the experimental resources, and yields better final performance when using the same resource budget, highlighting the value of exploiting temporal structure for sample-efficient closed-loop controller tuning.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated outstanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks, including code generation and comprehension. While LLMs have shown significant potential in assisting with coding, LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of LLMs to imperceptible attacks. This class of attacks manipulate source code at the character level, which renders the changes invisible to human reviewers yet effective in misleading LLMs' behaviour. We devise these attacks into four distinct categories and analyse their impacts on code analysis and comprehension tasks. These four types of imperceptible character attacks include coding reordering, invisible coding characters, code deletions, and code homoglyphs. To assess the robustness of state-of-the-art LLMs, we present a systematic evaluation across multiple models using both perturbed and clean code snippets. Two evaluation metrics, model confidence using log probabilities of response and response correctness, are introduced. The results reveal that LLMs are susceptible to imperceptible coding perturbations, with varying degrees of degradation highlighted across different LLMs. Furthermore, we observe a consistent negative correlation between perturbation magnitude and model performance. These results highlight the urgent need for robust LLMs capable of manoeuvring behaviours under imperceptible adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Video-based multimodal large language models (V-MLLMs) have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in video-text multimodal tasks. However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models - a common and practical real-world scenario - remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal large language model (I-MLLM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and spatiotemporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. Additionally, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as a surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rate (AASR) of 57.98% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for Zero-Shot VideoQA tasks, respectively.

Abstract: We introduce EnerVerse, a generative robotics foundation model that constructs and interprets embodied spaces. EnerVerse employs a chunk-wise autoregressive video diffusion framework to predict future embodied spaces from instructions, enhanced by a sparse context memory for long-term reasoning. To model the 3D robotics world, we adopt a multi-view video representation, providing rich perspectives to address challenges like motion ambiguity and 3D grounding. Additionally, EnerVerse-D, a data engine pipeline combining generative modeling with 4D Gaussian Splatting, forms a self-reinforcing data loop to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Leveraging these innovations, EnerVerse translates 4D world representations into physical actions via a policy head (EnerVerse-A), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world tasks. For efficiency, EnerVerse-A reuses features from the first denoising step and predicts action chunks, achieving about 280 ms per 8-step action chunk on a single RTX 4090. Further video demos, dataset samples could be found in our project page.

Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive. Advances with artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision and efficiency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large, standardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT Planning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality treatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial volumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle in the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to clinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk (OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan quality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Varian Eclipse. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters to reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions to deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations is proposed. A comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline produces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually, which traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to public research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine cohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025 challenge. To our best knowledge, this dataset features more than 10 times number of plans compared to the largest existing well-curated public dataset.

Abstract: Accurately assessing collision risk in dynamic traffic scenarios is a crucial requirement for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles~(AVs) and enables a comprehensive safety evaluation of automated driving systems. To that end, this paper presents a novel probabilistic occupancy risk assessment~(PORA) metric. It uses spatiotemporal heatmaps as probabilistic occupancy predictions of surrounding traffic participants and estimates the risk of a collision along an AV's planned trajectory based on potential vehicle interactions. The use of probabilistic occupancy allows PORA to account for the uncertainty in future trajectories and velocities of traffic participants in the risk estimates. The risk from potential vehicle interactions is then further adjusted through a Cox model\edit{,} which considers the relative \edit{motion} between the AV and surrounding traffic participants. We demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances the accuracy of collision risk assessment in dynamic traffic scenarios, resulting in safer vehicle controllers, and provides a robust framework for real-time decision-making in autonomous driving systems. From evaluation in Monte Carlo simulations, PORA is shown to be more effective at accurately characterizing collision risk compared to other safety surrogate measures.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used to produce predictions that serve as input data in subsequent statistical analyses. For example, computer vision predictions of economic and environmental indicators based on satellite imagery are used in downstream regressions; similarly, language models are widely used to approximate human ratings and opinions in social science research. However, failure to properly account for errors in the machine learning predictions renders standard statistical procedures invalid. Prior work uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid confidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables, assuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the scope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the complete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample and to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly, the method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional calculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no assumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than the intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions.

Abstract: Approximation and learning of classifiers of large data sets by neural networks in terms of high-dimensional geometry and statistical learning theory are investigated. The influence of the VC dimension of sets of input-output functions of networks on approximation capabilities is compared with its influence on consistency in learning from samples of data. It is shown that, whereas finite VC dimension is desirable for uniform convergence of empirical errors, it may not be desirable for approximation of functions drawn from a probability distribution modeling the likelihood that they occur in a given type of application. Based on the concentration-of-measure properties of high dimensional geometry, it is proven that both errors in approximation and empirical errors behave almost deterministically for networks implementing sets of input-output functions with finite VC dimensions in processing large data sets. Practical limitations of the universal approximation property, the trade-offs between the accuracy of approximation and consistency in learning from data, and the influence of depth of networks with ReLU units on their accuracy and consistency are discussed.

Abstract: Global biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, yet little information is known about most species and how their populations are changing. Indeed, some 90% of Earth's species are estimated to be completely unknown. Machine learning has recently emerged as a promising tool to facilitate long-term, large-scale biodiversity monitoring, including algorithms for fine-grained classification of species from images. However, such algorithms typically are not designed to detect examples from categories unseen during training -- the problem of open-set recognition (OSR) -- limiting their applicability for highly diverse, poorly studied taxa such as insects. To address this gap, we introduce Open-Insect, a large-scale, fine-grained dataset to evaluate unknown species detection across different geographic regions with varying difficulty. We benchmark 38 OSR algorithms across three categories: post-hoc, training-time regularization, and training with auxiliary data, finding that simple post-hoc approaches remain a strong baseline. We also demonstrate how to leverage auxiliary data to improve species discovery in regions with limited data. Our results provide insights to guide the development of computer vision methods for biodiversity monitoring and species discovery.

Abstract: Cross-lingual, cross-task transfer is challenged by task-specific data scarcity, which becomes more severe as language support grows and is further amplified in vision-language models (VLMs). We investigate multilingual generalization in encoder-decoder transformer VLMs to enable zero-shot image captioning in languages encountered only in the translation task. In this setting, the encoder must learn to generate generalizable, task-aware latent vision representations to instruct the decoder via inserted cross-attention layers. To analyze scaling behavior, we train Florence-2 based and Gemma-2 based models (0.4B to 11.2B parameters) on a synthetic dataset using varying compute budgets. While all languages in the dataset have image-aligned translations, only a subset of them include image captions. Notably, we show that captioning can emerge using a language prefix, even when this language only appears in the translation task. We find that indirect learning of unseen task-language pairs adheres to scaling laws that are governed by the multilinguality of the model, model size, and seen training samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the scaling laws extend to downstream tasks, achieving competitive performance through fine-tuning in multimodal machine translation (Multi30K, CoMMuTE), lexical disambiguation (CoMMuTE), and image captioning (Multi30K, XM3600, COCO Karpathy).

Abstract: Dynamic convolution enhances model capacity by adaptively combining multiple kernels, yet faces critical trade-offs: prior works either (1) incur significant parameter overhead by scaling kernel numbers linearly, (2) compromise inference speed through complex kernel interactions, or (3) struggle to jointly optimize dynamic attention and static kernels. We observe that pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit inter-layer redundancy akin to that in Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, dense convolutional layers can be efficiently replaced by derived "child" layers generated from a shared "parent" convolutional kernel through an adapter. To address these limitations and implement the weight-sharing mechanism, we propose a lightweight convolution kernel plug-in, named KernelDNA. It decouples kernel adaptation into input-dependent dynamic routing and pre-trained static modulation, ensuring both parameter efficiency and hardware-friendly inference. Unlike existing dynamic convolutions that expand parameters via multi-kernel ensembles, our method leverages cross-layer weight sharing and adapter-based modulation, enabling dynamic kernel specialization without altering the standard convolution structure. This design preserves the native computational efficiency of standard convolutions while enhancing representation power through input-adaptive kernel adjustments. Experiments on image classification and dense prediction tasks demonstrate that KernelDNA achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency balance among dynamic convolution variants.

Abstract: In Scene Graph Generation (SGG), structured representations are extracted from visual inputs as object nodes and connecting predicates, enabling image-based reasoning for diverse downstream tasks. While fully supervised SGG has improved steadily, it suffers from training bias due to limited curated data and long-tail predicate distributions, leading to poor predicate diversity and degraded downstream performance. We present PRISM-0, a zero-shot open-vocabulary SGG framework that leverages foundation models in a bottom-up pipeline to capture a broad spectrum of predicates. Detected object pairs are filtered, described via a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate fine- and coarse-grained predicates, which are then validated by a Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. PRISM-0 modular, dataset-independent design enriches existing SGG datasets such as Visual Genome and produces diverse, unbiased graphs. While operating entirely in a zero-shot setting, PRISM-0 achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art weakly-supervised models on SGG benchmarks and even state-of-the-art supervised methods in tasks such as Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.

Abstract: In the landscape of Fact-based Judgment Prediction and Explanation (FJPE), reliance on factual data is essential for developing robust and realistic AI-driven decision-making tools. This paper introduces TathyaNyaya, the largest annotated dataset for FJPE tailored to the Indian legal context, encompassing judgments from the Supreme Court of India and various High Courts. Derived from the Hindi terms "Tathya" (fact) and "Nyaya" (justice), the TathyaNyaya dataset is uniquely designed to focus on factual statements rather than complete legal texts, reflecting real-world judicial processes where factual data drives outcomes. Complementing this dataset, we present FactLegalLlama, an instruction-tuned variant of the LLaMa-3-8B Large Language Model (LLM), optimized for generating high-quality explanations in FJPE tasks. Finetuned on the factual data in TathyaNyaya, FactLegalLlama integrates predictive accuracy with coherent, contextually relevant explanations, addressing the critical need for transparency and interpretability in AI-assisted legal systems. Our methodology combines transformers for binary judgment prediction with FactLegalLlama for explanation generation, creating a robust framework for advancing FJPE in the Indian legal domain. TathyaNyaya not only surpasses existing datasets in scale and diversity but also establishes a benchmark for building explainable AI systems in legal analysis. The findings underscore the importance of factual precision and domain-specific tuning in enhancing predictive performance and interpretability, positioning TathyaNyaya and FactLegalLlama as foundational resources for AI-assisted legal decision-making.

arXiv:2504.14717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TAPIP3D, a novel approach for long-term 3D point tracking in monocular RGB and RGB-D videos. TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera movement is effectively canceled out. Within this stabilized 3D representation, TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame motion estimates, enabling robust point tracking over long time horizons. To handle the irregular structure of 3D point distributions, we propose a 3D Neighborhood-to-Neighborhood (N2N) attention mechanism - a 3D-aware contextualization strategy that builds informative, spatially coherent feature neighborhoods to support precise trajectory estimation. Our 3D-centric formulation significantly improves performance over existing 3D point tracking methods and even surpasses state-of-the-art 2D pixel trackers in accuracy when reliable depth is available. The model supports inference in both camera-centric (unstabilized) and world-centric (stabilized) coordinates, with experiments showing that compensating for camera motion leads to substantial gains in tracking robustness. By replacing the conventional 2D square correlation windows used in prior 2D and 3D trackers with a spatially grounded 3D attention mechanism, TAPIP3D achieves strong and consistent results across multiple 3D point tracking benchmarks.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modal encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference may be of a different modality (text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them with the reward function to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two finite sets to approximate distributional reward optimization. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. DRAGON is a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Demos at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web

Abstract: We consider a class of statistical inverse problems involving the estimation of a regression operator from a Polish space to a separable Hilbert space, where the target lies in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space induced by an operator-valued kernel. To address the associated ill-posedness, we analyze regularized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms in both online and finite-horizon settings. The former uses polynomially decaying step sizes and regularization parameters, while the latter adopts fixed values. Under suitable structural and distributional assumptions, we establish dimension-independent bounds for prediction and estimation errors. The resulting convergence rates are near-optimal in expectation, and we also derive high-probability estimates that imply almost sure convergence. Our analysis introduces a general technique for obtaining high-probability guarantees in infinite-dimensional settings. Possible extensions to broader kernel classes and encoder-decoder structures are briefly discussed.

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions, including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

Abstract: Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. Computational efficiency is crucial for scalable reservoir computing, requiring better strategies to reduce training cost. In this work, we uncover a connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. We show that NGRC can be trained without regularization, reducing computational time. Our contributions are twofold. First, merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags, high-degree polynomials, and short length of training data. Second, we evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, singular value decomposition (SVD), and lower-upper (LU) decomposition) for solving the regularized least-squares problem. Our results reveal that SVD-based training achieves accurate forecasts without regularization, being preferable when compared against the other algorithms.

Abstract: IoT networks often face conflicting routing goals such as maximizing packet delivery, minimizing delay, and conserving limited battery energy. These priorities can also change dynamically: for example, an emergency alert requires high reliability, while routine monitoring prioritizes energy efficiency to prolong network lifetime. Existing works, including many deep reinforcement learning approaches, are typically centralized and assume static objectives, making them slow to adapt when preferences shift. We propose a dynamic and fully distributed multi-objective Q-learning routing algorithm that learns multiple per-preference Q-tables in parallel and introduces a novel greedy interpolation policy to act near-optimally for unseen preferences without retraining or central coordination. A theoretical analysis further shows that the optimal value function is Lipschitz-continuous in the preference parameter, ensuring that the proposed greedy interpolation policy yields provably near-optimal behavior. Simulations show that our approach adapts in real time to shifting priorities and achieves up to 80-90\% lower energy consumption and more than 2-5x higher cumulative rewards and packet delivery compared to six baseline protocols. These results demonstrate significant gains in adaptability, delivery, and efficiency for dynamic IoT environments.

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.

<title>Compress, Gather, and Recompute: REFORMing Long-Context Processing in Transformers</title>

arXiv:2506.01215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second, it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves over 52% and 34% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench, RepoEval, and MM-NIAH, demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally, REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving both efficiency and superior performance.

<title>Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds, ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

arXiv:2506.13613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference, that looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a parametric family, minimizing a loss that is typically the (reverse) Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we focus on the following parametric family: mixtures of isotropic Gaussians (i.e., with diagonal covariance matrices proportional to the identity) and uniform weights. We develop a variational framework and provide efficient algorithms suited for this family. In contrast with mixtures of Gaussian with generic covariance matrices, this choice presents a balance between accurate approximations of multimodal Bayesian posteriors, while being memory and computationally efficient. Our algorithms implement gradient descent on the location of the mixture components (the modes of the Gaussians), and either (an entropic) Mirror or Bures descent on their variance parameters. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms on numerical experiments.

arXiv:2506.23293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel paradigm of emergent local memory. It is a continuous-learning completely-parallel content-addressable memory encoding global order. It demonstrates how local constraints on uncoordinated learning can produce topologically protected memories realizing emergent symbolic order. It is therefore a neuro-symbolic bridge.
  It further has the ability to produce human language without data, by exploiting its own self-organizing dynamics. It teaches us that words arise as a side-effect of emergent symbolic order, and that human language patterns at all structural levels reflect a universal mechanism of word formation (which is subregular). This work answers essential questions about the existence \& origin of all the human language data.

Abstract: Adaptive exercise recommendation (ER) aims to choose the next activity that matches a learner's evolving Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). We present KUL-Rec, a biologically inspired ER system that couples a fast Hebbian memory with slow replay-based consolidation to enable continual, few-shot personalization from sparse interactions. The model operates in an embedding space, allowing a single architecture to handle both tabular knowledge-tracing logs and open-ended short-answer text. We align evaluation with tutoring needs using bidirectional ranking and rank-sensitive metrics (nDCG, Recall@K). Across ten public datasets, KUL-Rec improves macro nDCG (0.316 vs. 0.265 for the strongest baseline) and Recall@10 (0.305 vs. 0.211), while achieving low inference latency and an $\approx99$\% reduction in peak GPU memory relative to a competitive graph-based model. In a 13-week graduate course, KUL-Rec personalized weekly short-answer quizzes generated by a retrieval-augmented pipeline and the personalized quizzes were associated with lower perceived difficulty and higher helpfulness (p < .05). An embedding robustness audit highlights that encoder choice affects semantic alignment, motivating routine audits when deploying open-response assessment. Together, these results indicate that Hebbian replay with bounded consolidation offers a practical path to real-time, interpretable ER that scales across data modalities and classroom settings.

<title>Not All Attention Heads Are What You Need: Refining CLIP's Image Representation with Attention Ablation</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. Building on interpretability studies, we conduct an exhaustive analysis and find that certain heads, distributed across layers, are detrimental to the resulting representations. To mitigate their impact, we propose a simple yet effective Attention Ablation Technique (AAT) that suppresses selected heads by directly manipulating their attention weights. By incorporating two complementary strategies tailored to different application scenarios, AAT enables the systematic identification and ablation of harmful heads with minimal overhead. Experiments show that AAT consistently improves downstream performance across diverse domains, boosting recall by up to 11.1% on cross-modal retrieval benchmarks. These results highlight that AAT can effectively refine large-scale VLMs with virtually no extra inference cost, while yielding semantically meaningful patterns that align with existing interpretability findings.

arXiv:2507.03806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based framework for approximating an exact magnetic-field interaction model, supported by both numerical and experimental validation. High-fidelity magnetic-field interaction modeling is essential for achieving exceptional accuracy and responsiveness across a wide range of fields, including transportation, energy systems, medicine, biomedical robotics, and aerospace robotics. In aerospace engineering, magnetic actuation has been investigated as a fuel-free solution for multi-satellite attitude and formation control. Although the exact magnetic field can be computed from the Biot-Savart law, the associated computational cost is prohibitive, and prior studies have therefore relied on dipole approximations to improve efficiency. However, these approximations lose accuracy during proximity operations, leading to unstable behavior and even collisions. To address this limitation, we develop a learning-based approximation framework that faithfully reproduces the exact field while dramatically reducing computational cost. The proposed method additionally provides a certified error bound, derived from the number of training samples, ensuring reliable prediction accuracy. The learned model can also accommodate interactions between coils of different sizes through appropriate geometric transformations, without retraining. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework under challenging conditions, a spacecraft docking scenario is examined through both numerical simulations and experimental validation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Fast Equivariant Imaging (FEI), a novel unsupervised learning framework to rapidly and efficiently train deep imaging networks without ground-truth data. From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior efficiency and performance compared to the vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In particular, our FEI schemes achieve an order-of-magnitude (10x) acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net for X-ray CT reconstruction and image inpainting, with improved generalization performance.

arXiv:2507.10795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most persistent challenges in network science is the development of various synthetic graph models to support subsequent analyses. Among the most notable frameworks addressing this issue is the Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD) model, a random graph model with community structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes. The model generates graphs similar to the well-known LFR model but it is faster, more interpretable, and can be investigated analytically. In this paper, we use the underlying ingredients of ABCD and introduce its variant, mABCD, thereby addressing the gap in models capable of generating multilayer networks. The uniqueness of the proposed approach lies in its flexibility at both levels of modelling: the internal structure of individual layers and the inter-layer dependencies, which together make the network a coherent structure rather than a collection of loosely coupled graphs. In addition to the conceptual description of the framework, we provide a comprehensive analysis of its efficient Julia implementation. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of mABCD to one of the most prominent problems in the area of complex systems: spreading phenomena analysis.

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them. However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge (Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

arXiv:2507.22842v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law, aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.

Abstract: As the use of AI in society grows, addressing emerging biases is essential to prevent systematic discrimination. Several bias detection methods have been proposed, but, with few exceptions, these tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. We present ABIDE (Argumentative BIas detection by DEbate), a novel framework that structures bias detection transparently as debate, guided by an underlying argument graph as understood in (formal and computational) argumentation. The arguments are about the success chances of groups in local neighbourhoods and the significance of these neighbourhoods. We evaluate ABIDE experimentally and demonstrate its strengths in performance against an argumentative baseline.

<title>Efficient Reasoning for Large Reasoning Language Models via Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression</title>

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance. However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy. It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3 family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i) black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step, safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs, pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal medical agentic systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

<title>Unintended Misalignment from Agentic Fine-Tuning: Risks and Mitigation</title>

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

<title>Optimal Subspace Embeddings: Resolving Nelson-Nguyen Conjecture Up to Sub-Polylogarithmic Factors</title>

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply. In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency, up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage compared to state-of-the-art GNN designs while also delivering higher model accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. This is the first interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable, and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader adoption across scientific applications.

<title>Frequency Response Identification of Low-Order Systems: Finite-Sample Analysis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17142</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.17142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-domain system identification method for learning low-order systems. The identification problem is formulated as the minimization of the l2 norm between the identified and measured frequency responses, with the nuclear norm of the Loewner matrix serving as a regularization term. This formulation results in an optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using standard convex optimization techniques. We derive an upper bound on the sampled-frequency complexity of the identification process and subsequently extend this bound to characterize the identification error over all frequencies. A detailed analysis of the sample complexity is provided, along with a thorough interpretation of its terms and dependencies. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through an example, and numerical simulations validating the growth rate of the sample complexity bound.

<title>Multi-Metric Preference Alignment for Generative Speech Restoration</title>

Abstract: Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation, its application to generative speech restoration remains largely under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency, and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models (MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce scenarios like singing voice restoration.

Abstract: We present NoLBERT, a lightweight, timestamped foundational language model for empirical research -- particularly for forecasting in economics, finance, and the social sciences. By pretraining exclusively on text from 1976 to 1995, NoLBERT avoids both lookback and lookahead biases (information leakage) that can undermine econometric inference. It exceeds domain-specific baselines on NLP benchmarks while maintaining temporal consistency. Applied to patent texts, NoLBERT enables the construction of firm-level innovation networks and shows that gains in innovation centrality predict higher long-run profit growth.

<title>GRAM-R$^2$: Self-Training Generative Foundation Reward Models for Reward Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models. Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data. Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$ can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative baselines.

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective, motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50 features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE = 10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in DNNs.

<title>VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

<title>Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology</title>

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.

<title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>

Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.

Abstract: Reliable handling of code diffs is central to agents that edit and refactor repositories at scale. We introduce Diff-XYZ, a compact benchmark for code-diff understanding with three supervised tasks: apply (old code $+$ diff $\rightarrow$ new code), anti-apply (new code $-$ diff $\rightarrow$ old code), and diff generation (new code $-$ old code $\rightarrow$ diff). Instances in the benchmark are triples $\langle \textit{old code}, \textit{new code}, \textit{diff} \rangle$ drawn from real commits in CommitPackFT, paired with automatic metrics and a clear evaluation protocol. We use the benchmark to do a focused empirical study of the unified diff format and run a cross-format comparison of different diff representations. Our findings reveal that different formats should be used depending on the use case and model size. For example, representing diffs in search-replace format performs best for larger models across most tasks, while structured udiff variants offer similar but slightly weaker performance. In contrast, smaller open models benefit little from any formatting choice. The Diff-XYZ benchmark is a reusable foundation for assessing and improving diff handling in LLMs that can aid future development of diff formats and models editing code. The dataset is published on HuggingFace Hub: https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/diff-xyz.

Abstract: Video comprises the vast majority of bits that are generated daily, and is the primary signal driving current innovations in robotics, remote sensing, and wearable technology. Yet, the most powerful video understanding models are too expensive for the resource-constrained platforms used in these applications. One approach is to offload inference to the cloud; this gives access to GPUs capable of processing high-resolution videos in real time. But even with reliable, high-bandwidth communication channels, the combined latency of video encoding, model inference, and round-trip communication prohibits use for certain real-time applications. The alternative is to use fully local inference; but this places extreme constraints on computational and power costs, requiring smaller models and lower resolution, leading to degraded accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Dedelayed, a real-time inference system that divides computation between a remote model operating on delayed video frames and a local model with access to the current frame. The remote model is trained to make predictions on anticipated future frames, which the local model incorporates into its prediction for the current frame. The local and remote models are jointly optimized with an autoencoder that limits the transmission bitrate required by the available downlink communication channel. We evaluate Dedelayed on the task of real-time streaming video segmentation using the BDD100k driving dataset. For a round trip delay of 100 ms, Dedelayed improves performance by 6.4 mIoU compared to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference -- an equivalent improvement to using a model ten times larger.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains, what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150 meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples, providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics. Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

<title>Convergence of Regret Matching in Potential Games and Constrained Optimization</title>

Abstract: Regret matching (RM) -- and its modern variants -- is a foundational online algorithm that has been at the heart of many AI breakthrough results in solving benchmark zero-sum games, such as poker. Yet, surprisingly little is known so far in theory about its convergence beyond two-player zero-sum games. For example, whether regret matching converges to Nash equilibria in potential games has been an open problem for two decades. Even beyond games, one could try to use RM variants for general constrained optimization problems. Recent empirical evidence suggests that they -- particularly regret matching$^+$ (RM$^+$) -- attain strong performance on benchmark constrained optimization problems, outperforming traditional gradient descent-type algorithms.
  We show that RM$^+$ converges to an $\epsilon$-KKT point after $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations, establishing for the first time that it is a sound and fast first-order optimizer. Our argument relates the KKT gap to the accumulated regret, two quantities that are entirely disparate in general but interact in an intriguing way in our setting, so much so that when regrets are bounded, our complexity bound improves all the way to $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^2)$. From a technical standpoint, while RM$^+$ does not have the usual one-step improvement property in general, we show that it does in a certain region that the algorithm will quickly reach and remain in thereafter. In sharp contrast, our second main result establishes a lower bound: RM, with or without alternation, can take an exponential number of iterations to reach a crude approximate solution even in two-player potential games. This represents the first worst-case separation between RM and RM$^+$. Our lower bound shows that convergence to coarse correlated equilibria in potential games is exponentially faster than convergence to Nash equilibria.

Abstract: Clustering on NISQ hardware is constrained by data loading and limited qubits. We present \textbf{qc-kmeans}, a hybrid compressive $k$-means that summarizes a dataset with a constant-size Fourier-feature sketch and selects centroids by solving small per-group QUBOs with shallow QAOA circuits. The QFF sketch estimator is unbiased with mean-squared error $O(\varepsilon^2)$ for $B,S=\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$, and the peak-qubit requirement $q_{\text{peak}}=\max\{D,\lceil \log_2 B\rceil + 1\}$ does not scale with the number of samples. A refinement step with elitist retention ensures non-increasing surrogate cost. In Qiskit Aer simulations (depth $p{=}1$), the method ran with $\le 9$ qubits on low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks and achieved competitive sum-of-squared errors relative to quantum baselines; runtimes are not directly comparable. On nine real datasets (up to $4.3\times 10^5$ points), the pipeline maintained constant peak-qubit usage in simulation. Under IBM noise models, accuracy was similar to the idealized setting. Overall, qc-kmeans offers a NISQ-oriented formulation with shallow, bounded-width circuits and competitive clustering quality in simulation.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.

Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85%, 99.90%, and 99.69% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.

However, existing models face significant limitations, such as being restricted to editing synthesized music generated by their own models, requiring highly precise prompts, or necessitating task-specific retraining, thus lacking true zero-shot capability. leveraging recent advances in rectified flow and diffusion transformers, we introduce MusRec, a zero-shot text-to-music editing model capable of performing diverse editing tasks on real-world music efficiently and effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in preserving musical content, structural consistency, and editing fidelity, establishing a strong foundation for controllable music editing in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning over procedural sequences, where the order of steps directly impacts outcomes, is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs). In this work, we study the task of reconstructing globally ordered sequences from shuffled procedural steps, using a curated dataset of food recipes, a domain where correct sequencing is essential for task success. We evaluate several LLMs under zero-shot and few-shot settings and present a comprehensive evaluation framework that adapts established metrics from ranking and sequence alignment. These include Kendall's Tau, Normalized Longest Common Subsequence (NLCS), and Normalized Edit Distance (NED), which capture complementary aspects of ordering quality. Our analysis shows that model performance declines with increasing sequence length, reflecting the added complexity of longer procedures. We also find that greater step displacement in the input, corresponding to more severe shuffling, leads to further degradation. These findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in procedural reasoning, especially with longer and more disordered inputs.

Abstract: Building trustworthy clinical AI systems requires not only accurate predictions but also transparent, biologically grounded explanations. We present \texttt{DiagnoLLM}, a hybrid framework that integrates Bayesian deconvolution, eQTL-guided deep learning, and LLM-based narrative generation for interpretable disease diagnosis. DiagnoLLM begins with GP-unmix, a Gaussian Process-based hierarchical model that infers cell-type-specific gene expression profiles from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data while modeling biological uncertainty. These features, combined with regulatory priors from eQTL analysis, power a neural classifier that achieves high predictive performance in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection (88.0\% accuracy). To support human understanding and trust, we introduce an LLM-based reasoning module that translates model outputs into audience-specific diagnostic reports, grounded in clinical features, attribution signals, and domain knowledge. Human evaluations confirm that these reports are accurate, actionable, and appropriately tailored for both physicians and patients. Our findings show that LLMs, when deployed as post-hoc reasoners rather than end-to-end predictors, can serve as effective communicators within hybrid diagnostic pipelines.

Abstract: The substantial memory bandwidth and computational demands of large language models (LLMs) present critical challenges for efficient inference. To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration. However, existing high-precision (e.g., FP16) PIM compute units incur significant area and power overhead in DRAM technology, limiting the effective computation throughput. In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator for P3-LLM, featuring enhanced compute units to support hybrid numerical formats. Our careful choice of numerical formats allows to co-design low-precision PIM compute units that significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in terms of both KV-cache quantization and weight-activation quantization. Combining the proposed quantization scheme with PIM architecture co-design, P3-LLM yields an average of $4.9\times$, $2.0\times$, and $3.4\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art LLM accelerators HBM-PIM, Ecco, and Pimba, respectively.

Abstract: Safety alignment instills in Large Language Models (LLMs) a critical capacity to refuse malicious requests. Prior works have modeled this refusal mechanism as a single linear direction in the activation space. We posit that this is an oversimplification that conflates two functionally distinct neural processes: the detection of harm and the execution of a refusal. In this work, we deconstruct this single representation into a Harm Detection Direction and a Refusal Execution Direction. Leveraging this fine-grained model, we introduce Differentiated Bi-Directional Intervention (DBDI), a new white-box framework that precisely neutralizes the safety alignment at critical layer. DBDI applies adaptive projection nullification to the refusal execution direction while suppressing the harm detection direction via direct steering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBDI outperforms prominent jailbreaking methods, achieving up to a 97.88\% attack success rate on models such as Llama-2. By providing a more granular and mechanistic framework, our work offers a new direction for the in-depth understanding of LLM safety alignment.

<div> Keywords: EEG emotion recognition, Valence-Arousal space, contrastive learning, spatial-temporal transformer, cross-dataset generalization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Emotion recognition from EEG signals plays a critical role in affective computing, but existing deep learning models often struggle to generalize across different datasets due to heterogeneous annotation schemes and data formats. This paper introduces EMOD, a unified framework that learns transferable and emotion-aware EEG representations by leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) guided contrastive learning. EMOD addresses semantic inconsistencies by projecting discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space, enabling emotionally similar samples to cluster effectively in the latent space through a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss. To handle varying EEG signal structures, EMOD employs a flexible architecture consisting of a Triple-Domain Encoder combined with a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, facilitating robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial EEG features. The framework is pretrained on eight public EEG emotion datasets, which enhances its capability to manage diverse data formats and labeling schemes. Evaluation on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that EMOD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting strong adaptability and generalization in EEG-based emotion recognition tasks across heterogeneous datasets and scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Emotion recognition from EEG signals is essential for affective computing and has been widely explored using deep learning. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved strong performance on single EEG emotion datasets, their generalization across datasets remains limited due to the heterogeneity in annotation schemes and data formats. Existing models typically require dataset-specific architectures tailored to input structure and lack semantic alignment across diverse emotion labels. To address these challenges, we propose EMOD: A Unified EEG Emotion Representation Framework Leveraging Valence-Arousal (V-A) Guided Contrastive Learning. EMOD learns transferable and emotion-aware representations from heterogeneous datasets by bridging both semantic and structural gaps. Specifically, we project discrete and continuous emotion labels into a unified V-A space and formulate a soft-weighted supervised contrastive loss that encourages emotionally similar samples to cluster in the latent space. To accommodate variable EEG formats, EMOD employs a flexible backbone comprising a Triple-Domain Encoder followed by a Spatial-Temporal Transformer, enabling robust extraction and integration of temporal, spectral, and spatial features. We pretrain EMOD on 8 public EEG datasets and evaluate its performance on three benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that EMOD achieves the state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong adaptability and generalization across diverse EEG-based emotion recognition scenarios.

<div> Keywords: multimodal fusion, benchmark, evaluation, datasets, performance baselines<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the critical limitation in multimodal fusion research caused by the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks. Current evaluation practices rely on a small set of public datasets, which inadequately capture the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios and may lead to biased model assessments. This scarcity of unified evaluation standards results in two main challenges: overfitting of models to dataset-specific biases and difficulty in objectively comparing different fusion methods. To overcome these obstacles, the authors propose a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark that integrates over 30 datasets, covering 15 different modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. Complementing this benchmark, the authors have developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline. This pipeline standardizes the implementation of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms, facilitating fair and reproducible assessments. Utilizing this platform, they conducted extensive experiments that established new performance baselines for multiple tasks, setting a solid foundation for future research. The presented benchmark and evaluation framework offer the academic community a crucial tool to rigorously and objectively evaluate multimodal models, thus aiming to advance the field of multimodal artificial intelligence significantly. <div>

Abstract: Although multimodal fusion has made significant progress, its advancement is severely hindered by the lack of adequate evaluation benchmarks. Current fusion methods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a limited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue presents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of specific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical applications. On the other hand, the absence of a unified evaluation standard makes fair and objective comparisons between different fusion methods difficult. Consequently, a truly universal and high-performance fusion model has yet to emerge. To address these challenges, we have developed a large-scale, domain-adaptive benchmark for multimodal evaluation. This benchmark integrates over 30 datasets, encompassing 15 modalities and 20 predictive tasks across key application domains. To complement this, we have also developed an open-source, unified, and automated evaluation pipeline that includes standardized implementations of state-of-the-art models and diverse fusion paradigms. Leveraging this platform, we have conducted large-scale experiments, successfully establishing new performance baselines across multiple tasks. This work provides the academic community with a crucial platform for rigorous and reproducible assessment of multimodal models, aiming to propel the field of multimodal artificial intelligence to new heights.

<div> Keywords: Spiking Neural Networks, Knowledge Distillation, Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation, Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation, Energy Efficiency<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer superior energy efficiency compared to traditional neural networks but face challenges in effective training. Existing methods utilize knowledge distillation (KD) by adopting pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) as teachers to guide SNN students, typically through element-wise alignment of features and logits. However, these approaches often overlook the fundamental differences between ANNs and SNNs, where ANN outputs are continuous while SNN outputs are sparse and discrete. To address this mismatch, the paper introduces two novel KD strategies. The first, Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), aligns the student's spike activation maps with class-aware activation maps from the teacher, leveraging saliency maps to achieve better semantic and distribution consistency instead of raw feature alignment. The second method, Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), applies Gaussian noise to student SNN logits to smooth their sparsity, enabling improved alignment with the continuous logits of the teacher ANN. Extensive experiments across various datasets validate the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing SNN training. The authors also provide public access to their implementation to facilitate further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) become popular due to excellent energy efficiency, yet facing challenges for effective model training. Recent works improve this by introducing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, with the pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) used as teachers and the target SNNs as students. This is commonly accomplished through a straightforward element-wise alignment of intermediate features and prediction logits from ANNs and SNNs, often neglecting the intrinsic differences between their architectures. Specifically, ANN's outputs exhibit a continuous distribution, whereas SNN's outputs are characterized by sparsity and discreteness. To mitigate this issue, we introduce two innovative KD strategies. Firstly, we propose the Saliency-scaled Activation Map Distillation (SAMD), which aligns the spike activation map of the student SNN with the class-aware activation map of the teacher ANN. Rather than performing KD directly on the raw %and distinct features of ANN and SNN, our SAMD directs the student to learn from saliency activation maps that exhibit greater semantic and distribution consistency. Additionally, we propose a Noise-smoothed Logits Distillation (NLD), which utilizes Gaussian noise to smooth the sparse logits of student SNN, facilitating the alignment with continuous logits from teacher ANN. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available~\footnote{https://github.com/SinoLeu/CKDSNN.git}.

<div> Keywords: long-tailed distributions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, head-tail ratio, LT-Soups, model soups<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of learning from real-world long-tailed (LT) datasets, where head classes dominate and tail classes are underrepresented. It highlights that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer, while effective at preserving tail-class performance in foundation models such as CLIP, tend to reduce accuracy on the head classes. The authors identify the head-tail ratio—the proportion between head and tail classes—as a key factor influencing this trade-off, which has been overlooked in prior work. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 varying both imbalance ratio (ρ) and head-tail ratio (η), they demonstrate that PEFT methods excel in tail-heavy scenarios but perform worse in balanced or head-heavy distributions. To address these shortcomings, they propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to mitigate head-class bias. In the second stage, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the entire dataset to recover head-class accuracy. Experimental evaluations on six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups consistently outperforms both PEFT and traditional model soups, achieving a better balance across various LT regimes and improving generalization over diverse long-tailed data distributions. <div>

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\rho$) and head-tail ratio ($\eta$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

<div> Keywords: Lagrangian system identification, cubic B-Spline, sparse regression, noise robustness, nonlinear dynamics<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of discovering governing equations from data in nonlinear dynamical systems, focusing on overcoming the limitations of sparse regression methods that struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity. First, it introduces the integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, allowing for accurate modeling of complex nonlinearities within mechanical systems. Second, it proposes a robust equation discovery mechanism that leverages measurement data efficiently while embedding known physical constraints to improve identification accuracy. Third, the work develops a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, which constrains higher-order derivatives and significantly reduces sensitivity to measurement noise, particularly in second-order dynamical systems. The combination of these contributions results in a differentiable sparse identification framework that outperforms existing baseline methods, delivering more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data. This approach is particularly well-suited for complex mechanical systems where data is often limited and corrupted by noise, making it a promising advancement in data-driven nonlinear system identification. <div>

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

<div> Parameter-Efficient Finetuning, Representation Finetuning, Mathematical Reasoning, Prefix Generation, Error Accumulation  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of improving mathematical reasoning in large language models through finetuning techniques. It identifies that while Representation Finetuning (ReFT) is more parameter-efficient than standard Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) and shows superior performance on several tasks, it underperforms significantly on mathematical reasoning tasks. The primary cause is ReFT’s difficulty in generating effective reasoning prefixes during the early stages of inference, which leads to disruption of numerical encoding and error accumulation during chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT). BREP ReFT enhances performance by truncating training data to better optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening during the early inference phase to prevent error buildup, and constraining the magnitude of intervention vectors to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments conducted across various model architectures demonstrate that BREP outperforms both standard ReFT and traditional weight-based PEFT methods on mathematical reasoning tasks. This method achieves superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization. The paper also provides the source code publicly at https://github.com/LiangThree/BREP for further research and application. <div>

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

<div> Uncertainty quantification, generative models, precision-recall curves, distribution approximation, ensemble methods<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses a critical yet often overlooked issue in generative model research: the quantification of uncertainty in how well these models approximate target distributions. While typical evaluations measure the closeness between learned and true distributions, they fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in these estimates. The authors formalize the concept of uncertainty quantification in the context of generative model learning and propose new directions for research to fill this gap. One such direction is the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves, which aggregate multiple model outputs to better capture uncertainty. Preliminary experiments conducted on synthetic datasets provide evidence that aggregated precision-recall curves effectively reflect model approximation uncertainty. This approach not only offers a more nuanced evaluation metric but also facilitates systematic comparisons between different generative model architectures based on their uncertainty profiles. Overall, this position paper highlights the importance of incorporating uncertainty quantification into the evaluation framework of generative models, thus promoting more robust assessments and guiding future methodological advancements in the field. <div>

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

<div> Functional Independence Measure, Deep Neural Network, ST-GCN, BiLSTM, Attention Mechanism<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The article addresses the challenge of assessing patients' physical independence in daily activities through the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), which traditionally requires significant effort from both patients and healthcare professionals. To alleviate this burden, the authors propose an automated method for estimating FIM scores using simple exercises that differ from the standard FIM assessment tasks. Their approach integrates a deep neural network architecture combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to capture temporal dependencies and highlight key body-joint contributions. The model was evaluated on data from 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing specifically on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Results demonstrate the model's capability to differentiate between fully independent patients and those needing assistance, achieving balanced accuracy scores between 70.09% and 78.79% across various FIM items. Furthermore, the study identifies distinct movement patterns serving as reliable predictors for certain FIM evaluation components, suggesting potential for automated, less burdensome assessment in clinical rehabilitation contexts. <div>

Abstract: The functional independence measure (FIM) is widely used to evaluate patients' physical independence in activities of daily living. However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.

<div> Neural Tangent Kernel, trace estimation, Hutch++, automatic differentiation, matrix-free methods<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the computational challenges associated with analyzing the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), particularly focusing on recurrent architectures where full NTK matrix calculation is often impractical. The authors propose a matrix-free approach leveraging trace estimation techniques, enabling rapid analysis of finite-width empirical NTKs. They introduce numerical methods based on the Hutch++ trace estimator, which come with provable fast convergence guarantees. A key insight is that the NTK's structure allows the trace to be computed using only one mode of automatic differentiation (either forward or reverse), eliminating the need for both modes and simplifying computation. These one-sided estimators demonstrate superior performance compared to Hutch++ in scenarios with low sample sizes and when there is a significant difference between the model’s state size and parameter count. Overall, the study shows that randomized matrix-free methods can accelerate NTK analysis by several orders of magnitude, facilitating faster experimentation and potential applications in machine learning theory and practice. <div>

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

<div> Linear Predictive Clustering, Mixed-Integer Programming, Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization, Global Optimization, Scalability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the problem of Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC), which clusters samples based on linear relationships between features and target variables. Traditional greedy optimization methods used for LPC alternate between clustering and regression but fail to guarantee global optimality and struggle with overlapping (non-separable) clusters. To overcome these limitations, the authors build on a constrained optimization approach initially proposed by Bertsimas and Shioda (2007), who formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) that ensures global optimality but is computationally expensive and poorly scalable. The paper proposes two novel improvements to enhance efficiency and scalability of this global optimization paradigm. First, by exploiting theoretical properties of separability, the authors develop near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, reducing the complexity of the MIP formulation. Second, they approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, offering further computational gains in certain scenarios. Experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal that the new methods consistently produce near-optimal solutions with significantly lower regression errors than greedy methods, while also being more scalable than existing MIP solutions. These advances enable practical LPC applications in diverse domains such as marketing, medicine, and education. <div>

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

<title>Transformers know more than they can tell -- Learning the Collatz sequence</title>

<div> Keywords: Transformer models, Collatz sequence, arithmetic functions, loop length prediction, model accuracy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This article studies the ability of transformer models to predict long steps in the Collatz sequence, a complex arithmetic function defined by specific rules for even and odd integers. The accuracy of the models is dependent on the numerical base used for encoding inputs and outputs, with the highest accuracy (up to 99.7%) achieved using bases 24 and 32, and much lower accuracy (around 25–37%) for bases 3 and 11. Regardless of the base, all models exhibit a consistent learning behavior where they identify classes of inputs sharing the same residue modulo powers of two, achieving near-perfect accuracy on these classes and very low accuracy outside them. This pattern correlates with a known mathematical property: the length of the loops in the Collatz computation can be derived from the binary representation of inputs. The models effectively learn to predict inputs corresponding to increasing loop lengths, which represents the core control structure of this arithmetic problem. Analysis of incorrect predictions shows that errors are mostly systematic, involving misestimation of loop lengths rather than hallucinations or random mistakes. These insights not only clarify the exact algorithms the models have internalized but also suggest that understanding such control structures is key when modeling complex arithmetic functions. The authors propose that their methodology can improve understanding and development of language models more broadly. <div>
arXiv:2511.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

<div> neural operators, transformer, PDE, transfer learning, fine-tuning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the high computational cost of training neural operators used in data-driven physical simulations. The authors explore the use of transformer-based neural operators within a general transfer learning framework, expanding their application beyond previously studied specific problems. The study investigates the ability of these models to transfer knowledge by pretraining on simpler PDE problems and fine-tuning on more complex ones. Performance is evaluated across a variety of partial differential equation (PDE) tasks, including challenges such as extrapolating to unseen parameter regimes, integrating additional variables not present during pretraining, and transferring knowledge from datasets involving multiple equations. Results show that transformer-based neural operators exhibit strong transfer capabilities, effectively adapting learned representations to new PDE scenarios and tasks. This suggests that advanced neural operator architectures can facilitate more efficient training workflows and broader applicability in computational physics by leveraging downstream learning techniques. <div>

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

<div> Quantum kernel methods, variational quantum kernel, parameter scaling, high-dimensional datasets, real-world machine learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the gap in evaluating quantum kernel methods on complex, high-dimensional, real-world datasets, moving beyond prior work focused mainly on low-dimensional or synthetic data. The authors developed a variational quantum kernel framework that employs resource-efficient ansätze tailored for complex classification tasks. They introduced a novel parameter scaling technique aimed at accelerating the convergence of the quantum kernel training process. The framework was benchmarked extensively using eight challenging datasets spanning various data types, including tabular data, images, time series, and graphs. Results were obtained through classical simulation, where the proposed quantum kernel consistently outperformed traditional classical kernels such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. These findings suggest that carefully designed quantum kernels can serve as versatile and high-performance tools in machine learning applications. Despite promising results, the paper notes that further research is necessary to conclusively demonstrate practical quantum advantage in real-world scenarios. Overall, the work lays a foundational platform for quantum-enhanced machine learning applications by validating quantum kernel potential across diverse, realistic datasets. <div>
arXiv:2511.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ans\"atze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

<div> Equation discovery, symbolic regression, surface benchmarking, large language models, geometry-aware metrics  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces SurfaceBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for symbolic surface discovery, addressing a key challenge in machine learning for science: recovering concise symbolic equations governing complex physical and geometric phenomena. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus largely on scalar functions and use brittle string-matching metrics, SurfaceBench offers 183 tasks covering 15 symbolic complexity categories with explicit, implicit, and parametric equation forms. Each task contains ground-truth formulas, variable semantics, and synthetically generated 3D data, emphasizing surface-level structure and resisting memorization by large language models through novel symbolic compositions. The benchmark draws from real scientific domains including fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry, ensuring domain grounding. To evaluate performance, SurfaceBench combines symbolic equation checks with geometry-aware metrics like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic correctness and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art methods struggle to generalize across varied representation types and complexities, performing well only on specific formula families. SurfaceBench thus presents a challenging and diagnostic testbed that facilitates principled benchmarking of advancements in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. The authors provide open-source code for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

<div> Keywords: satellite imagery, low-latency delivery, distributed runtime, multi-task inference, dynamic filter ordering<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of reducing latency in delivering satellite imagery for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring, which traditionally experience delays due to bandwidth limitations when downlinking all images before analysis.<br /><br />2. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a joint decision problem between satellites in orbit and ground stations.<br /><br />3. EarthSight introduces three main innovations: (a) multi-task inference on satellites using shared neural network backbones to efficiently handle multiple vision tasks simultaneously, reducing redundant computation; (b) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts image priorities, and allocates compute resources accordingly; and (c) dynamic filter ordering, which balances model selectivity, accuracy, and computational cost to discard low-value images early and conserve onboard resources.<br /><br />4. This framework leverages global context from ground stations and adaptive, resource-aware decisions onboard satellites, allowing constellation-wide scalable and low-latency image analysis within strict bandwidth and power constraints.<br /><br />5. Evaluations using a satellite simulator demonstrate EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and cuts the 90th percentile latency from first contact to image delivery from 51 minutes to 21 minutes compared to existing baselines, significantly enhancing responsiveness and mission scope. <div>
arXiv:2511.10834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

<title>The Map of Misbelief: Tracing Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hallucinations Through Attention Patterns</title>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, hallucination detection, attention-based uncertainty, extrinsic hallucinations, intrinsic hallucinations<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical applications. It identifies two distinct types of hallucinations: extrinsic, where the model generates information not supported by the input, and intrinsic, where the model distorts or fabricates details within the given input. The authors introduce a principled evaluation framework that clearly differentiates these hallucination types and tests detection methods on targeted benchmark datasets. They investigate existing confidence representation techniques, noting that sampling-based methods such as Semantic Entropy perform well for identifying extrinsic hallucinations but are ineffective for intrinsic ones. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes novel attention aggregation strategies based on a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm. These strategies not only improve hallucination detection performance, especially for intrinsic hallucinations, but also enhance interpretability by leveraging attention signals as a rich source of uncertainty information. The findings emphasize that aligning detection methods to the specific nature of hallucination improves effectiveness, suggesting attention mechanisms are valuable for uncertainty estimation in LLM outputs. This work offers new directions for creating more reliable and explainable hallucination detection tools for critical LLM deployments. <div>
arXiv:2511.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

<div> Keywords: continuous-time dynamics, neural controlled differential equations, invertible neural flow, irregular time series, data-adaptive manifold<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses the challenge of modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly sampled time series data, a problem relevant in many real-world applications.  
2. Neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDEs) provide a suitable framework, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how the control path is constructed from discrete observations.  
3. Traditional approaches use fixed interpolation methods to construct the control path, which often fail to accurately capture the underlying data geometry, especially when data is highly missing.  
4. The authors propose FlowPath, a novel method that learns the geometry of the control path through an invertible neural flow, creating a continuous, data-adaptive manifold for the control path instead of simple interpolations.  
5. The invertibility constraint of FlowPath ensures information preservation and well-behaved transformations, differentiating it from prior learnable path models that lack such constraints.  
6. Experimental results on 18 benchmark datasets and one real-world case study show that FlowPath consistently improves classification accuracy compared to fixed interpolation baselines and non-invertible models.  
7. This work emphasizes the significance of modeling the geometry of the control path, alongside the dynamics evolving on it, for robust and generalizable learning from irregular time series data. <div>
arXiv:2511.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, off-policy evaluation, behaviour policy, variance reduction, policy-gradient methods<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. This paper addresses the issue of high variance in return estimates, which leads to poor sample efficiency and instability in many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that rely on these estimates for policy improvement.  <br />2. It builds on recent findings in off-policy evaluation demonstrating that well-designed behaviour policies, used to collect off-policy data, can produce provably lower variance return estimates compared to on-policy data collection, a surprising and counterintuitive result. <br />3. The key insight is extended to an online RL setting, where policy evaluation and policy improvement occur simultaneously to learn optimal policies. <br />4. While traditional off-policy RL approaches focus on reconciling data collected asynchronously from multiple workers (like in IMPALA), here the authors consider a single worker setup, emphasizing the role of the behaviour policy in data collection for variance reduction. <br />5. Empirical results show that integrating this variance reduction regime into two policy-gradient methods leads to improved sample efficiency and overall performance across diverse environments, validating the theoretical claims. <div>
arXiv:2511.10843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

<div> Time series, foundation models, EEG, spatial-temporal adapter, multi-head pooling<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the performance comparison between EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) and general time series foundation models (TSFMs) on EEG-related tasks. It introduces a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), designed to enhance general TSFMs by explicitly modeling the spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data. STAMP leverages univariate embeddings generated by general TSFMs, adapting these representations to better capture EEG-specific features. The proposed adapter achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A thorough evaluation is conducted on eight benchmark datasets focused on clinical EEG classification tasks, providing robust experimental validation. Ablation studies additionally highlight the contributions of different components of the STAMP design. Importantly, the adapter architecture is lightweight with fewer trainable parameters, making it computationally efficient. It also offers flexibility by supporting various input configurations, facilitating easy integration of EEG data into general TSFMs without requiring full retraining of specialized EEG models. Overall, the work presents a promising approach to leverage general foundation models for EEG-specific tasks by applying targeted spatial-temporal adaptations, expanding the potential use of TSFMs in neuroscience and clinical applications. <div>
arXiv:2511.10848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

<div> code generation, code selection, large language models, pairwise queries, ExPairT-LLM<br /><br />Summary: Despite significant progress in large language models (LLMs), generating correct code remains challenging. To address this, code selection algorithms pick the best program from multiple LLM-generated candidates but often struggle due to incorrectly distinguishing nonequivalent programs or over-relying on the LLM's ability to perfectly predict outputs. The paper introduces ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm that improves code selection by using two novel types of queries posed to an LLM oracle: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence queries. These queries are simpler for LLMs to handle, allowing ExPairT-LLM to conduct a tournament-style selection that is robust even when the LLM makes occasional mistakes. Experiments conducted on four popular code datasets demonstrate that ExPairT-LLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art code selection algorithms, improving the top-1 pass rate (pass@1) by an average of 13.0% and up to 27.1%. Furthermore, it substantially enhances the pass@1 rate for LLMs engaged in complex reasoning tasks, yielding an improvement of 24.0%. This approach represents a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for reliable and accurate code generation. <div>
arXiv:2511.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

<div> Differential Privacy, Zeroth-Order Optimization, Public Data, Gradient Approximation, Privacy-Utility Tradeoff

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the computational and memory inefficiencies of first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning methods like DP-SGD, which hinder their practical deployment despite existing optimizations. It highlights the potential of zeroth-order methods, which approximate gradients using function evaluations and are easier to privatize, as a solution to reduce these overheads. However, prior zeroth-order approaches have shown lower utility than DP-SGD and have been tested in limited domains. To improve upon this, the authors propose a framework called Public-Data-Assisted Zeroth-Order optimizers (PAZO), which leverages publicly available data to guide and enhance gradient approximations in private zeroth-order algorithms while incurring minimal additional cost. They provide theoretical analysis assuming similarity between public and private datasets to justify the approach. Empirically, PAZO is shown to achieve better privacy-utility trade-offs on vision and text tasks, in both pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. It outperforms the best first-order methods that also use public data, especially when privacy requirements are stringent, while offering up to 16 times faster runtime. This work suggests that combining public data with zeroth-order techniques significantly advances the efficiency and effectiveness of DP machine learning. <div>

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

<div> Keywords: code LLMs, data imbalance, Golang, unit test generation, GO UT Bench

<br /><br />Summary:  
Training data imbalance is a significant challenge for code large language models (LLMs), with existing datasets predominantly composed of raw open-source code, leading to poor performance on broader software engineering tasks. Low-resource languages such as Golang are especially underrepresented, causing models to excel at tasks like code autocompletion but struggle with practical developer workflows like unit test generation. To address this, the authors introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset consisting of 5,264 pairs of Golang code and corresponding unit tests, collected from 10 permissively licensed repositories covering diverse domains. The dataset aims to bridge the gap in training resources for realistic software engineering tasks. The authors evaluate GO UT Bench by fine-tuning two families of LLM architectures—mixture of experts and dense decoders—to assess its effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models consistently outperform their base versions on more than 75% of the benchmark tasks, confirming the dataset's utility in enhancing code LLM performance on unit test generation for Golang. This work highlights the importance of balanced training data that includes real-world developer tasks to improve code model applicability beyond code completion. <div>

Abstract: Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

<div> arXiv, Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Graph Encoder-Decoder, Subgoal Representation, Intrinsic Rewards  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the integration of graphs into Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL), highlighting the limitation of existing methods which depend heavily on domain-specific knowledge to construct graphs, thus restricting their adaptability to new tasks. It also points out the challenges faced by dynamic graph construction approaches during exploration, particularly in effectively transmitting graph information to newly encountered states. The authors propose a novel method called Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), which leverages a graph encoder-decoder trained on the state graph generated during exploration to evaluate unseen states. G4RL is designed to integrate easily with existing GCHRL frameworks, especially in environments characterized by symmetric and reversible transitions. By incorporating G4RL, the approach enhances subgoal representation and improves sample efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing both high-level and low-level intrinsic rewards derived from the graph encoder-decoder leads to significant performance gains in both dense and sparse reward environments. Importantly, these improvements come with minimal additional computational cost, making G4RL a practical enhancement for state-of-the-art GCHRL methods. <div>
arXiv:2511.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

<div> Keywords: muscle activations, multi-joint systems, physics-informed deep learning, cross-attention, BiGRU  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces in multi-joint systems, which is vital for clinical assessment and assistive device control but is often hindered by computational expense and lack of high-quality labeled datasets. The authors propose a novel physics-informed deep learning framework, the PI-MJCA-BiGRU, that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematic data without relying on ground-truth labels. Central to this framework is the Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module combined with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers, which effectively capture inter-joint coordination by allowing each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. The framework incorporates multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions directly into the loss function to ensure physiologically consistent predictions. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that the PI-MJCA-BiGRU framework achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods, despite operating without labeled data. Additionally, the MJCA module significantly improves the modeling of inter-joint coordination compared to standard baseline architectures. Overall, this approach offers a time-efficient, label-free solution for accurately estimating muscle activations and forces in complex multi-joint systems. <div>

<div> polymer property prediction, multi-view design, graph neural networks, SMILES language models, Open Polymer Prediction Challenge<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of predicting polymer properties using a multi-view approach that leverages complementary molecular representations. The system integrates four distinct families of models: (i) tabular RDKit/Morgan descriptors that capture traditional chemical descriptors, (ii) graph neural networks that model molecular connectivity, (iii) 3D-informed representations encoding spatial conformation, and (iv) pretrained SMILES language models that learn from sequential molecular data. By training these models using 10-fold cross-validation splits, the approach ensures robust learning and generalization. The ensemble combines per-property predictions through a uniform averaging method, enhancing performance by aggregating diverse insights from the four model families. Additionally, test-time augmentation is applied by generating multiple SMILES strings per polymer to improve prediction stability. The resulting method was evaluated in the Open Polymer Prediction Challenge at NeurIPS 2025, where it ranked 9th out of 2,241 participating teams. The ensemble achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.057 on the public leaderboard and 0.082 on the private leaderboard, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy and competitive performance against a large pool of competitors. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining multiple molecular representation techniques within an ensemble framework for polymer property prediction tasks. <div>

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

<div> Federated clustering, privacy-preserving, structural graphs, knowledge sharing, graph alignment  

<br /><br />Summary:  
The paper addresses challenges in federated clustering, specifically balancing data privacy with model performance, noting current methods either risk sensitive data leakage by transmitting embeddings or suffer accuracy loss by sharing only abstract cluster prototypes. To overcome this, the authors propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), which uses local structural graphs as a privacy-friendly medium for knowledge sharing, moving beyond conventional embedding or prototype exchange. The framework follows a client-server model where clients build private structural graphs that capture intrinsic data relationships; these graphs are securely aggregated and aligned by the server to form a global graph for unified clustering. SPP-FGC supports two modes: a one-shot method for rapid single-round communication and an iterative version, SPP-FGC+, suited for complex data like images, where feature representations are collaboratively refined to improve performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPP-FGC improves clustering accuracy by up to 10% in normalized mutual information (NMI) compared to federated baselines while ensuring provable privacy guarantees. This approach effectively enhances federated clustering by safeguarding user privacy without sacrificing model quality, making it suitable for decentralized, unlabeled data analysis. <div>
arXiv:2511.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

The paper addresses graph unlearning as a method to comply with "the right to be forgotten" by enabling the removal of sensitive data from graph neural networks, but highlights that it is vulnerable to attacks.<br /><br />2. The authors introduce GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack designed specifically to recover deleted data from supposedly unlearned graph neural networks by using a curvature matching module for detailed recovery.<br /><br />3. GraphToxin can retrieve not only the erased individual’s information and personal connections but also sensitive content from their associated nodes, posing significant privacy risks beyond initial expectations.<br /><br />4. The attack is extended to scenarios involving multiple node removals and is evaluated under both white-box and black-box settings, with a novel evaluation framework that assesses performance in random and worst-case removal scenarios.<br /><br />5. Experimental results show GraphToxin’s high effectiveness and adaptability, while current defense methods fail to stop the attack and sometimes even enhance its success, emphasizing the urgent need for stronger and more reliable defenses against such graph reconstruction threats. <div>
arXiv:2511.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

<div> cascade bandit, edge inference, regret analysis, decision-making policies, adaptivity<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper studies a variant of the cascade bandit model tailored for edge inference scenarios where each arm represents an inference model characterized by its accuracy and error probability. Four decision-making policies—Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling—are analyzed to evaluate performance in terms of regret. It is shown that the traditional policies Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination perform suboptimally because they fix their action ordering after an initial exploration phase, reducing their ability to adapt to new information. In contrast, adaptive algorithms such as LCB and Thompson Sampling continually update their action choices based on ongoing feedback from the environment, enabling them to achieve a constant O(1) regret bound. This demonstrates that continuous adaptivity is essential for efficient decision-making in uncertain edge inference settings. The theoretical analysis is supported by simulation results which confirm the superiority of adaptive policies over non-adaptive ones in minimizing regret under uncertainty. The findings highlight the importance of policy design that dynamically leverages feedback to optimize inference model selection at the edge. <div>

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

<div> Diffusion model, flow matching, MIMO, channel estimation, velocity field<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of slow sampling speed in diffusion model (DM)-based channel estimation for MIMO systems, which is used to acquire high-precision channel state information (CSI) via stepwise posterior sampling and denoising. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a novel generative model based on flow matching (FM) techniques. They first reformulate the channel estimation problem under the FM framework by defining a conditional probability path that smoothly transitions from noisy channel data to the true channel distribution along a straight-line trajectory at constant speed. Using this formulation, they derive a velocity field dependent only on noise statistics, which guides the training of the generative model. During sampling, this trained velocity field acts as prior knowledge, enabling rapid and reliable noise channel enhancement through an ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the FM-based channel estimation significantly reduces sampling overhead compared to existing score matching (SM)-based DM methods. Additionally, the proposed method achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under various channel conditions, indicating its potential for efficient and precise CSI acquisition in practical MIMO communication systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion model (DM)-based channel estimation, which generates channel samples via a posteriori sampling stepwise with denoising process, has shown potential in high-precision channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

<div> Keywords: Machine Learning, credit risk, data quality, robustness, data corruption  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper examines the influence of data quality issues on the performance of machine learning models used for credit risk evaluation. It focuses on common data problems such as missing values, noisy features, outliers, and incorrect labels, which can degrade predictive accuracy. Using an open-source credit risk dataset, the authors apply controlled data corruptions via the Pucktrick library to simulate these quality issues systematically. They evaluate the robustness of ten widely used models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression, under varying levels and types of data contamination. Experimental results reveal notable differences in model resilience depending on both the severity and nature of data degradation, highlighting that some models maintain higher predictive accuracy despite corrupted input data. The study offers a practical methodology and associated tools that help practitioners strengthen data processing pipelines against quality-related breakdowns. Additionally, the framework provides a flexible experimental environment for researchers aiming to explore data-centric AI challenges and advance robust machine learning applications within credit risk assessment and beyond. <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are being increasingly employed for credit risk evaluation, with their effectiveness largely hinging on the quality of the input data. In this paper we investigate the impact of several data quality issues, including missing values, noisy attributes, outliers, and label errors, on the predictive accuracy of the machine learning model used in credit risk assessment. Utilizing an open-source dataset, we introduce controlled data corruption using the Pucktrick library to assess the robustness of 10 frequently used models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression and so on. Our experiments show significant differences in model robustness based on the nature and severity of the data degradation. Moreover, the proposed methodology and accompanying tools offer practical support for practitioners seeking to enhance data pipeline robustness, and provide researchers with a flexible framework for further experimentation in data-centric AI contexts.

<div> Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Adversarial Robustness, VAT, URDA, DART<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of improving adversarial robustness in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), where traditional UDA methods focus primarily on transferability but neglect defense against adversarial attacks. It investigates why vanilla adversarial training (VAT), despite its success in standard deep learning, fails to enhance robustness in the UDA setting. The authors develop a novel theoretical framework by deriving a new generalization bound that integrates adversarial noise resistance with domain shift adaptation, extending classical UDA theory. To overcome inherent difficulties in merging VAT with UDA, they propose a new paradigm named Unsupervised Robust Domain Adaptation (URDA). Building upon this, the paper introduces the Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART) algorithm, a simple yet effective two-step training procedure. DART first pre-trains any UDA model and subsequently applies a robustification post-training step using disentangled distillation to ensure both transferability and adversarial robustness. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets, both with and without adversarial attacks, demonstrate that DART significantly improves robustness while preserving domain adaptation performance. This work is the first to establish the URDA paradigm and provide accompanying theoretical guarantees, contributing a practical and theoretically grounded approach to robust domain adaptation. <div>

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

<title>Enhancing Graph Representations with Neighborhood-Contextualized Message-Passing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: Graph Neural Networks, Message-Passing, Neighborhood-Contextualization, Attention Mechanism, SINC-GCN<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. The paper addresses a limitation in classical message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which typically focus on pairwise interactions between a central node and its neighbors, neglecting rich contextual information from the broader local neighborhood.<br />2. It formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, inspired by the attentional GNN variant, aiming to incorporate wider neighborhood context into message-passing.<br />3. Building on this concept, the authors propose the neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework, which generalizes existing message-passing GNN architectures.<br />4. To operationalize NCMP, a simple, practical, and efficient parametrization method is introduced, resulting in the Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN).<br />5. Preliminary experiments on a synthetic binary node classification task demonstrate that SINC-GCN improves both expressivity and efficiency, highlighting the potential of NCMP to enhance the representational power of classical GNNs and suggesting a promising direction for future graph learning research. <div>
arXiv:2511.11046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

<div> Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks, Pre-computation, Label Leakage, Echoless Propagation, Partitioning Scheme<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are effective for learning on heterogeneous graphs but face efficiency challenges due to repetitive message passing during training on large-scale graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs improve efficiency by performing message passing once during preprocessing, enabling mini-batch training using regular-shaped tensors. However, label-based pre-computation approaches suffer from training label leakage caused by the echo effect, where a node's own label information loops back during multi-hop message passing. Existing solutions either require high memory or are incompatible with advanced message passing techniques. To address these issues, the paper proposes Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), featuring Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP), which partitions target nodes and ensures that nodes only collect label information from neighbors in other partitions. This eliminates label echo while retaining memory efficiency and compatibility with any message passing method. Additionally, an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism are introduced to mitigate information loss from partitioning and manage distributional shifts among partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP outperforms existing baselines in accuracy while maintaining memory efficiency, making it a practical solution for training HGNNs on large heterogeneous graphs. <div>

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

<div> Zero-shot coordination, population-based training, Scalable Population Training, meta-agent, mutual information regularizer  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) is a significant topic in reinforcement learning, emphasizing agents' ability to generalize and effectively coordinate with unseen collaborators without further fine-tuning. Traditional population-based training methods have demonstrated promising results for ZSC but are constrained by computational resources. These methods typically optimize diversity within small populations but fail to leverage potential performance benefits that arise from increasing population size. To overcome these limitations, the paper introduces Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), a novel and efficient framework designed to scale population-based training effectively. ScaPT incorporates two main components: a meta-agent mechanism that efficiently represents a large population by selectively sharing parameters among agents, reducing computational overhead, and a mutual information regularizer that ensures and maintains diversity within the population. The combined approach promotes both scalability and diversity, critical factors for improved zero-shot coordination outcomes. The paper empirically validates ScaPT’s effectiveness in the challenging environment of Hanabi, a cooperative card game frequently used for evaluating coordination in multi-agent systems. Results demonstrate that ScaPT outperforms existing representational frameworks and training methods, confirming its capacity to scale populations while achieving superior zero-shot coordination performance. <div>

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

<div> Predictive coding, cellular sheaves, sheaf cohomology, recurrent networks, Hodge decomposition<br /><br />Summary: This paper presents a novel perspective on predictive coding (PC) networks by formulating linear PC networks as cellular sheaves, where the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors. It demonstrates that PC inference operates as a diffusion process governed by the sheaf Laplacian. The authors use sheaf cohomology to characterize irreducible error patterns that cannot be resolved through inference, providing insight into the limitations of error correction in these networks. The study focuses on recurrent network topologies, which often create feedback loops that introduce internal contradictions, leading to prediction errors independent of external supervision. By applying a Hodge decomposition, the paper identifies conditions under which these contradictions halt learning, effectively diagnosing when and why learning stalls. The sheaf-theoretic framework not only elucidates these critical issues but also serves as a practical tool for diagnosing problematic network configurations. Furthermore, the approach offers design principles aimed at effective weight initialization strategies to improve learning outcomes in recurrent predictive coding networks. This work bridges abstract mathematical concepts with neural network optimization, fostering new methods for network analysis and design in predictive coding frameworks. <div>
arXiv:2511.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) replaces global backpropagation with local optimization over weights and activations. We show that linear PC networks admit a natural formulation as cellular sheaves: the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors, and PC inference is diffusion under the sheaf Laplacian. Sheaf cohomology then characterizes irreducible error patterns that inference cannot remove. We analyze recurrent topologies where feedback loops create internal contradictions, introducing prediction errors unrelated to supervision. Using a Hodge decomposition, we determine when these contradictions cause learning to stall. The sheaf formalism provides both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.

<div> Keywords: Dragonfly network, workload interference, parallel discrete event simulation, graph neural networks, large language models  

<br /><br />Summary: The Dragonfly network is recognized for its high-radix and low-diameter topology, making it a top choice for interconnects in high-performance computing environments. A significant challenge within this network structure is managing workload interference on shared network links, which can degrade overall system performance. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) serves as a standard technique to analyze these interference patterns; however, high-fidelity PDES demands substantial computational resources, thus limiting its practicality for large-scale and real-time applications. To address this limitation, hybrid simulation approaches incorporating data-driven surrogate models have emerged as viable alternatives. These models are particularly effective for predicting application runtime amidst the dynamic and complex behavior of network traffic. The paper introduces \ourmodel, a novel surrogate model that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to effectively capture both spatial and temporal characteristics from port-level router data. Experimental results demonstrate that \ourmodel surpasses traditional statistical methods and existing machine learning baselines in accuracy. Consequently, \ourmodel facilitates precise runtime prediction, which enhances the efficiency of hybrid simulations tailored for Dragonfly networks, ultimately contributing to better workload management and network performance optimization. <div>

Abstract: The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

<div> Knowledge Graph Embeddings, Continual Learning, Embedding Initialization, Catastrophic Forgetting, Knowledge Retention<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of updating Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) when Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are frequently modified, requiring the embeddings to adapt continuously. The authors focus on the critical initial step of embedding initialization for new entities within continual learning frameworks, emphasizing its influence on final embedding accuracy and training duration, especially during small, incremental updates. They propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy that leverages the KG schema and previously learned embeddings, utilizing the classes to which new entities belong to derive their initial representations. This approach integrates seamlessly with existing continual learning methods, improving the acquisition of new knowledge and mitigating catastrophic forgetting of prior information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this initialization strategy enhances the predictive performance of KGEs and strengthens knowledge retention. Additionally, the method reduces the number of training epochs required, accelerating the incremental learning process and decreasing computational time. Lastly, the strategy’s effectiveness is validated across various types of KGE learning models, underscoring its broad applicability and benefits for continual updating scenarios in Knowledge Graph embeddings. <div>
arXiv:2511.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

<div> precipitation forecasting, deep learning, interpretability, ConvLSTM, Indian cities

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study presents an interpretable deep learning framework tailored for short-term precipitation forecasting in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, which represent diverse climatic zones. The framework employs a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM architecture trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data, allowing the model to capture spatiotemporal precipitation patterns effectively. Model optimization was city-specific, varying the number of convolutional filters to 32 for Bengaluru, 64 for Mumbai and Delhi, and 128 for Kolkata, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The models achieved respective RMSE values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata), indicating good performance across different urban environments. To promote transparency and facilitate real-world application, various explainability techniques were employed, including permutation importance, Grad-CAM, temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation. These analyses revealed that the models leveraged distinct, city-specific variable patterns and that effective prediction horizons varied by location, from one day in Bengaluru to up to five days in Kolkata. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of combining explainable AI methods with deep learning to deliver both accurate and interpretable precipitation forecasts customized for diverse urban climates. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

<div> Keywords: Jeffreys divergence, normalizing flows, energy-based models, symmetric divergence, constrained optimization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of learning probability distributions from finite samples by focusing on minimizing the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which combines forward and reverse KL divergences but is difficult to compute directly from samples. The authors propose a novel approach involving a proxy model designed not only to fit the data but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, enabling the adaptive balancing of priorities between the main and proxy models during training. By doing so, the method avoids brittle min-max adversarial formulations and leverages the strengths of both normalizing flows (NFs) and energy-based models (EBMs). The approach is demonstrated in practical applications including density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference, showing how it can combine the tractability of forward KL methods and the more symmetric properties of the Jeffreys divergence to better capture target distribution characteristics. This work contributes a practical algorithmic framework for minimizing a challenging symmetric divergence measure and opens avenues for improved model fitting in various machine learning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2511.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper tackles the critical problem of improving predictions for climate extreme events, with a focus on heat waves, by leveraging machine learning techniques. The authors formulate the task as a classification problem, aiming to predict if surface air temperature will surpass a specified local quantile threshold within a given timeframe. A major contribution is the introduction of a power mean aggregation strategy to combine ensemble predictions, which markedly improves prediction accuracy over the conventional approach of averaging (mean aggregation). By transforming a machine learning weather forecasting model into a generative one and applying this non-linear aggregation, the method achieves superior performance in identifying extreme heat occurrences. Importantly, the power mean aggregation’s optimal parameters depend on the chosen quantile threshold, suggesting its adaptability and enhanced effectiveness for predicting rarer, more extreme temperature events. This adaptable approach holds promise for better anticipating climate extremes, which is crucial for disaster preparedness and climate resilience planning. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

<div> Keywords: Incomplete Multi-View Clustering, Graph Neural Networks, Dynamic Graph Learning, Masked Graph Reconstruction Loss, Contrastive Learning  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses challenges in incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC), particularly the limitations of existing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods. First, the authors observe that current IMVC approaches often use static graphs constructed by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which introduces noise and reduces graph topology robustness. Second, standard use of Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss on graph reconstruction leads to high gradient noise during optimization. To overcome these issues, the paper proposes DGIMVCM, a novel framework that dynamically learns graph structures and employs a masked graph reconstruction loss strategy. The method begins by constructing a missing-robust global graph from raw multi-view data, which supports imputation of missing views through graph convolutional embedding layers extracting view-specific dynamic graphs. It integrates graph structure contrastive learning to enforce consistency across views. Next, high-level representations are extracted via a graph self-attention encoder, optimized using masked graph reconstruction loss to reduce gradient noise. Finally, a clustering module with pseudo-label self-supervised training refines the clustering results. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate DGIMVCM’s effectiveness and superiority over existing approaches, highlighting its robustness and improved clustering performance in incomplete multi-view scenarios. <div>

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

<div> LoRa, Reinforcement Learning, RSSI, Localization, Exploration  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of locating LoRa tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons or others at risk of going missing using mobile sensors. It focuses on optimizing the sequential decision-making process to minimize the number of moves needed to find a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag in unknown environments, relying on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Existing reinforcement learning approaches suffer from vulnerabilities to domain shifts and RSSI fluctuations, which cause cascading errors and reduce localization accuracy. To overcome these issues, the authors propose LoRaCompass, a novel reinforcement learning model. LoRaCompass enhances robustness by learning a spatial representation from RSSI data through a spatially-aware feature extractor combined with a policy distillation loss to ensure the sensor moves closer to the tag. Additionally, it incorporates an exploration mechanism inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy, which steadily increases the confidence in moves toward the tag. The system was tested in diverse, unseen ground-based and drone-assisted environments across an area exceeding 80 km². The results show LoRaCompass achieves over 90% success in locating the tag within 100 meters, marking a 40% improvement compared to prior methods, and demonstrates efficient search with a path length scaling linearly with the initial distance to the tag. <div>

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

<div> Federated Learning, early stopping, synthetic validation, generative AI, chest X-ray classification<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses inefficiencies in Federated Learning (FL), where training typically runs for a fixed number of global rounds, often resulting in unnecessary computation or suboptimal performance if stopped too late or too early. To mitigate this, the authors propose a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that utilizes generative AI to monitor model performance during training. This framework enables adaptive early stopping by identifying the optimal training round without relying on additional labeled validation data. The approach conserves computational resources by reducing redundant training rounds and facilitates faster hyperparameter tuning. Experimental evaluation on multi-label chest X-ray classification tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this method, achieving up to a 74% reduction in training rounds while maintaining model accuracy within 1% of the optimal performance. Overall, the work provides a practical solution for improving the efficiency and responsiveness of FL systems, especially in privacy-sensitive medical applications where data sharing is limited. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

<div> Keywords: Time Projection Chambers, sparse convolutional networks, ResNet, representation learning, nuclear physics detectors<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are detectors that track charged particles in an ionizing medium, widely used in nuclear physics experiments for precise measurements.<br /><br />2. The study investigates the use of sparse convolutional neural networks, specifically a sparse ResNet architecture, for learning representations of event data from TPCs.<br /><br />3.

Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $\beta$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.

<div> Neural networks, biometric authentication, finger-drawn digits, CNN, autoencoder<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper explores the use of neural network models for biometric authentication based on finger-drawn digits on touchscreen devices. The study involved twenty participants who each provided 2,000 digit samples drawn with their fingers on personal touchscreen devices. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures were evaluated: a modified Inception-V1 network and a lightweight shallow CNN optimized for mobile environments. Both CNNs achieved approximately 89% authentication accuracy, with the shallow CNN being more parameter-efficient and suitable for mobile deployment. In addition to CNNs, convolutional and fully connected autoencoder models were tested for anomaly detection, achieving around 75% accuracy. The research highlights that simple finger-drawn digit patterns (0-9) can serve as effective biometric identifiers. The findings suggest that finger-drawn symbol authentication is a viable, secure, and user-friendly method for touchscreen device security. Furthermore, this biometric approach can be combined with existing pattern-based authentication systems to enhance security through multi-layered mechanisms, particularly for mobile applications. Overall, the paper provides evidence supporting neural network-based finger-drawn digit authentication as a promising biometric technology for future secure mobile user verification. <div>

Additionally, we examined Convolutional and Fully Connected autoencoders for anomaly detection. Both CNN architectures achieved ~89% authentication accuracy, with the shallow CNN requiring fewer parameters. Autoencoder approaches achieved ~75% accuracy. The results demonstrate that finger-drawn symbol authentication provides a viable, secure, and user-friendly biometric solution for touchscreen devices. This approach can be integrated with existing pattern-based authentication methods to create multi-layered security systems for mobile applications.

<div> Virtual Width Networks, representational width, convergence speedup, token prediction, scaling efficiency  
<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a novel framework designed to enhance model representations by increasing width without the usual quadratic increase in computational cost tied to hidden size expansion. VWN disentangles representational width from the backbone network's width, allowing the embedding space to grow substantially while keeping core compute nearly unchanged. Large-scale experiments demonstrate that an 8-fold increase in virtual width accelerates optimization by more than 2 times in next-token prediction tasks and over 3 times in next-2-token prediction tasks. The benefits of VWN become more pronounced as training progresses, with both the performance gap and speedup ratio expanding, indicating greater token efficiency and heightened effectiveness at scale. Additionally, the authors uncover an approximately log-linear relationship between virtual width and loss reduction, which provides a new empirical foundation to consider virtual-width scaling as an independent and promising direction for improving large model efficiency. This approach offers a scalable and computationally efficient avenue to boost model performance without proportionally increasing computational demands. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

Abstract: Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.

<title>Toward Scalable Early Cancer Detection: Evaluating EHR-Based Predictive Models Against Traditional Screening Criteria</title>

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

<title>When Genes Speak: A Semantic-Guided Framework for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Data Clustering</title>

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling with spatial context, offering unprecedented insights into the tissue microenvironment. However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to "speak" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. Crucially, the FSM module exhibits plug-and-play versatility, consistently improving the performance when integrated into other baseline methods.

Abstract: We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the L\"owner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

<title>Multi-Phase Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformer-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

<title>Multicalibration yields better matchings</title>

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $\gamma$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat \gamma$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat \gamma$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $\gamma$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

<title>Differentiation Strategies for Acoustic Inverse Problems: Admittance Estimation and Shape Optimization</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

<title>Retrofit: Continual Learning with Bounded Forgetting for Security Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11439</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

<title>FairReweighing: Density Estimation-Based Reweighing Framework for Improving Separation in Fair Regression</title>

arXiv:2511.11459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

<title>Epistemic Error Decomposition for Multi-step Time Series Forecasting: Rethinking Bias-Variance in Recursive and Direct Strategies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11461</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11461</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

<title>MoCap2Radar: A Spatiotemporal Transformer for Synthesizing Micro-Doppler Radar Signatures from Motion Capture</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

<title>Quantifying and Improving Adaptivity in Conformal Prediction through Input Transformations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11472</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11472</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.

<title>Honesty over Accuracy: Trustworthy Language Models through Reinforced Hesitation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language models fail a fundamental requirement of trustworthy intelligence: knowing when not to answer. Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$\lambda$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $\lambda$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

<title>Generalizing Fair Clustering to Multiple Groups: Algorithms and Applications</title>

arXiv:2511.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

arXiv:2511.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

<title>Bayesian Evaluation of Large Language Model Behavior</title>

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

<title>Guarding the Meaning: Self-Supervised Training for Semantic Robustness in Guard Models</title>

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

<title>Evaluating LLM Understanding via Structured Tabular Decision Simulations</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

<title>Forecasting Spoken Language Development in Children with Cochlear Implants Using Preimplantation MRI</title>

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

<title>PISanitizer: Preventing Prompt Injection to Long-Context LLMs via Prompt Sanitization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10720</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long context LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, where an attacker can inject an instruction in a long context to induce an LLM to generate an attacker-desired output. Existing prompt injection defenses are designed for short contexts. When extended to long-context scenarios, they have limited effectiveness. The reason is that an injected instruction constitutes only a very small portion of a long context, making the defense very challenging. In this work, we propose PISanitizer, which first pinpoints and sanitizes potential injected tokens (if any) in a context before letting a backend LLM generate a response, thereby eliminating the influence of the injected instruction. To sanitize injected tokens, PISanitizer builds on two observations: (1) prompt injection attacks essentially craft an instruction that compels an LLM to follow it, and (2) LLMs intrinsically leverage the attention mechanism to focus on crucial input tokens for output generation. Guided by these two observations, we first intentionally let an LLM follow arbitrary instructions in a context and then sanitize tokens receiving high attention that drive the instruction-following behavior of the LLM. By design, PISanitizer presents a dilemma for an attacker: the more effectively an injected instruction compels an LLM to follow it, the more likely it is to be sanitized by PISanitizer. Our extensive evaluation shows that PISanitizer can successfully prevent prompt injection, maintain utility, outperform existing defenses, is efficient, and is robust to optimization-based and strong adaptive attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/sleeepeer/PISanitizer.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of engineering designs is limited by non-differentiable components in the typical computer-aided engineering (CAE) workflow, which calculates performance metrics from design parameters. While gradient-based methods could provide noticeable speed-ups in high-dimensional design spaces, codes for meshing, physical simulations, and other common components are not differentiable even if the math or physics underneath them is. We propose replacing non-differentiable pipeline components with surrogate models which are inherently differentiable. Using a toy example of aerodynamic shape optimization, we demonstrate an end-to-end differentiable pipeline where a 3D U-Net full-field surrogate replaces both meshing and simulation steps by training it on the mapping between the signed distance field (SDF) of the shape and the fields of interest. This approach enables gradient-based shape optimization without the need for differentiable solvers, which can be useful in situations where adjoint methods are unavailable and/or hard to implement.

Abstract: We study the estimation problem of distribution-on-distribution regression, where both predictors and responses are probability measures. Existing approaches typically rely on a global optimal transport map or tangent-space linearization, which can be restrictive in approximation capacity and distort geometry in multivariate underlying domains. In this paper, we propose the \emph{Neural Local Wasserstein Regression}, a flexible nonparametric framework that models regression through locally defined transport maps in Wasserstein space. Our method builds on the analogy with classical kernel regression: kernel weights based on the 2-Wasserstein distance localize estimators around reference measures, while neural networks parameterize transport operators that adapt flexibly to complex data geometries. This localized perspective broadens the class of admissible transformations and avoids the limitations of global map assumptions and linearization structures. We develop a practical training procedure using DeepSets-style architectures and Sinkhorn-approximated losses, combined with a greedy reference selection strategy for scalability. Through synthetic experiments on Gaussian and mixture models, as well as distributional prediction tasks on MNIST, we demonstrate that our approach effectively captures nonlinear and high-dimensional distributional relationships that elude existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: Context: Ensuring high levels of dependability in modern computer-based systems has become increasingly challenging due to their complexity. Although systems are validated at design time, their behavior can be different at run-time, possibly showing control-flow anomalies due to "unknown unknowns".
  Objective: We aim to detect control-flow anomalies through software monitoring, which verifies run-time behavior by logging software execution and detecting deviations from expected control flow.
  Methods: We propose a methodology to develop software monitors for control-flow anomaly detection through Large Language Models (LLMs) and conformance checking. The methodology builds on existing software development practices to maintain traditional V&amp;V while providing an additional level of robustness and trustworthiness. It leverages LLMs to link design-time models and implementation code, automating source-code instrumentation. The resulting event logs are analyzed via conformance checking, an explainable and effective technique for control-flow anomaly detection.
  Results: We test the methodology on a case-study scenario from the European Railway Traffic Management System / European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS), which is a railway standard for modern interoperable railways. The results obtained from the ERTMS/ETCS case study demonstrate that LLM-based source-code instrumentation can achieve up to 84.775% control-flow coverage of the reference design-time process model, while the subsequent conformance checking-based anomaly detection reaches a peak performance of 96.610% F1-score and 93.515% AUC.
  Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific knowledge to guide LLMs in source-code instrumentation significantly allowed obtaining reliable and quality software logs and enabled effective control-flow anomaly detection through conformance checking.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Abstract: The rapidly growing computation demands of deep neural networks (DNNs) have driven hardware vendors to integrate matrix multiplication accelerators (MMAs), such as NVIDIA Tensor Cores and AMD Matrix Cores, into modern GPUs. However, due to distinct and undocumented arithmetic specifications for floating-point matrix multiplication, some MMAs can lead to numerical imprecision and inconsistency that can compromise the stability and reproducibility of DNN training and inference.
  This paper presents MMA-Sim, the first bit-accurate reference model that reveals the detailed arithmetic behaviors of the MMAs from ten GPU architectures (eight from NVIDIA and two from AMD). By dissecting the MMAs using a combination of targeted and randomized tests, our methodology derives nine arithmetic algorithms to simulate the floating-point matrix multiplication of the MMAs. Large-scale validation confirms bitwise equivalence between MMA-Sim and the real hardware. Using MMA-Sim, we investigate arithmetic behaviors that affect DNN training stability, and identify undocumented behaviors that could lead to significant errors.

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning presents unique challenges due to the lack of explicitly labeled negative samples, particularly in high-stakes domains such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis. To address data scarcity and privacy constraints, we propose a novel transfer learning with model averaging framework that integrates information from heterogeneous data sources - including fully binary labeled, semi-supervised, and PU data sets - without direct data sharing. For each source domain type, a tailored logistic regression model is conducted, and knowledge is transferred to the PU target domain through model averaging. Optimal weights for combining source models are determined via a cross-validation criterion that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We establish theoretical guarantees for weight optimality and convergence, covering both misspecified and correctly specified target models, with further extensions to high-dimensional settings using sparsity-penalized estimators. Extensive simulations and real-world credit risk data analyses demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparative methods in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness, especially under limited labeled data and heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating structured outputs. While structured generation methods ensure validity, they often lack output diversity, a critical limitation that we confirm in our preliminary study. We propose a novel method to enhance diversity in automaton-based structured generation. Our approach utilizes automata traversal history to steer LLMs towards novel structural patterns. Evaluations show our method significantly improves structural and content diversity while maintaining comparable generation efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct a case study showcasing the effectiveness of our method in generating diverse test cases for testing open-source libraries.

<title>Correcting Mean Bias in Text Embeddings: A Refined Renormalization with Training-Free Improvements on MMTEB</title>

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + \mu$, where $\mu$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $\sigma$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $\sigma$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $\sigma$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $\mu$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $\mu$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

<title>PINGS-X: Physics-Informed Normalized Gaussian Splatting with Axes Alignment for Efficient Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI</title>

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

<title>One-Shot Transfer Learning for Nonlinear PDEs with Perturbative PINNs</title>

Abstract: We propose a framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by combining perturbation theory with one-shot transfer learning in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Nonlinear PDEs with polynomial terms are decomposed into a sequence of linear subproblems, which are efficiently solved using a Multi-Head PINN. Once the latent representation of the linear operator is learned, solutions to new PDE instances with varying perturbations, forcing terms, or boundary/initial conditions can be obtained in closed form without retraining.
  We validate the method on KPP-Fisher and wave equations, achieving errors on the order of 1e-3 while adapting to new problem instances in under 0.2 seconds; comparable accuracy to classical solvers but with faster transfer. Sensitivity analyses show predictable error growth with epsilon and polynomial degree, clarifying the method's effective regime.
  Our contributions are: (i) extending one-shot transfer learning from nonlinear ODEs to PDEs, (ii) deriving a closed-form solution for adapting to new PDE instances, and (iii) demonstrating accuracy and efficiency on canonical nonlinear PDEs. We conclude by outlining extensions to derivative-dependent nonlinearities and higher-dimensional PDEs.

<title>PRSM: A Measure to Evaluate CLIP's Robustness Against Paraphrases</title>

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is a widely used multimodal model that aligns text and image representations through large-scale training. While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.

Abstract: This paper addresses the nonparametric estimation of the drift function over a compact domain for a time-homogeneous diffusion process, based on high-frequency discrete observations from $N$ independent trajectories. We propose a neural network-based estimator and derive a non-asymptotic convergence rate, decomposed into a training error, an approximation error, and a diffusion-related term scaling as ${\log N}/{N}$. For compositional drift functions, we establish an explicit rate. In the numerical experiments, we consider a drift function with local fluctuations generated by a double-layer compositional structure featuring local oscillations, and show that the empirical convergence rate becomes independent of the input dimension $d$. Compared to the $B$-spline method, the neural network estimator achieves better convergence rates and more effectively captures local features, particularly in higher-dimensional settings.

<title>Refine and Align: Confidence Calibration through Multi-Agent Interaction in VQA</title>

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

<title>Decomposing Direct and Indirect Biases in Linear Models under Demographic Parity Constraint</title>

Abstract: Linear models are widely used in high-stakes decision-making due to their simplicity and interpretability. Yet when fairness constraints such as demographic parity are introduced, their effects on model coefficients, and thus on how predictive bias is distributed across features, remain opaque. Existing approaches on linear models often rely on strong and unrealistic assumptions, or overlook the explicit role of the sensitive attribute, limiting their practical utility for fairness assessment. We extend the work of (Chzhen and Schreuder, 2022) and (Fukuchi and Sakuma, 2023) by proposing a post-processing framework that can be applied on top of any linear model to decompose the resulting bias into direct (sensitive-attribute) and indirect (correlated-features) components. Our method analytically characterizes how demographic parity reshapes each model coefficient, including those of both sensitive and non-sensitive features. This enables a transparent, feature-level interpretation of fairness interventions and reveals how bias may persist or shift through correlated variables. Our framework requires no retraining and provides actionable insights for model auditing and mitigation. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method captures fairness dynamics missed by prior work, offering a practical and interpretable tool for responsible deployment of linear models.

Abstract: We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences.

Abstract: The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient, sparse, biologically inspired computation. Training them with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and surrogate gradients achieves strong performance but remains biologically implausible. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) provides a more local and biologically grounded alternative. However, existing EP frameworks, primarily based on deterministic neurons, either require complex mechanisms to handle discontinuities in spiking dynamics or fail to scale beyond simple visual tasks. Inspired by the stochastic nature of biological spiking mechanism and recent hardware trends, we propose a stochastic EP framework that integrates probabilistic spiking neurons into the EP paradigm. This formulation smoothens the optimization landscape, stabilizes training, and enables scalable learning in deep convolutional spiking convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the proposed stochastic EP dynamics approximate deterministic EP under mean-field theory, thereby inheriting its underlying theoretical guarantees. The proposed framework narrows the gap to both BPTT-trained SNNs and EP-trained non-spiking CRNNs in vision benchmarks while preserving locality, highlighting stochastic EP as a promising direction for neuromorphic and on-chip learning.

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been repeatedly proposed as a biometric modality, often with reports of high accuracy and operational feasibility. However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security perspective, analyzing how existing work differs across sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility. We construct a unified evaluation framework to empirically expose these issues and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics, such as per-class EER, FCS, and the Gini Coefficient, uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. Our analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles, which include replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.

Abstract: The routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) has become the de facto routing standard for resource-constrained IoT systems, but its lightweight design exposes critical vulnerabilities to a wide range of routing-layer attacks such as hello flood, decreased rank, and version number manipulation. Traditional countermeasures, including protocol-level modifications and machine learning classifiers, can achieve high accuracy against known threats, yet they fail when confronted with novel or zero-day attacks unless fully retrained, an approach that is impractical for dynamic IoT environments. In this paper, we investigate incremental learning as a practical and adaptive strategy for intrusion detection in RPL-based networks. We systematically evaluate five model families, including ensemble models and deep learning models. Our analysis highlights that incremental learning not only restores detection performance on new attack classes but also mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously learned threats, all while reducing training time compared to full retraining. By combining five diverse models with attack-specific analysis, forgetting behavior, and time efficiency, this study provides systematic evidence that incremental learning offers a scalable pathway to maintain resilient intrusion detection in evolving RPL-based IoT networks.

Abstract: Recently, several instances of non-Euclidean SGD, including SignSGD, Lion, and Muon, have attracted significant interest from the optimization community due to their practical success in training deep neural networks. Consequently, a number of works have attempted to explain this success by developing theoretical convergence analyses. Unfortunately, these results cannot properly justify the superior performance of these methods, as they could not beat the convergence rate of vanilla Euclidean SGD. We resolve this important open problem by developing a new unified convergence analysis under the structured smoothness and gradient noise assumption. In particular, our results indicate that non-Euclidean SGD (i) can exploit the sparsity or low-rank structure of the upper bounds on the Hessian and gradient noise, (ii) can provably benefit from popular algorithmic tools such as extrapolation or momentum variance reduction, and (iii) can match the state-of-the-art convergence rates of adaptive and more complex optimization algorithms such as AdaGrad and Shampoo.

Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: We consider the problems of \emph{learning} and \emph{testing} real-valued convex functions over Gaussian space. Despite the extensive study of function convexity across mathematics, statistics, and computer science, its learnability and testability have largely been examined only in discrete or restricted settings -- typically with respect to the Hamming distance, which is ill-suited for real-valued functions.
  In contrast, we study these problems in high dimensions under the standard Gaussian measure, assuming sample access to the function and a mild smoothness condition, namely Lipschitzness. A smoothness assumption is natural and, in fact, necessary even in one dimension: without it, convexity cannot be inferred from finitely many samples. As our main results, we give:
  - Learning Convex Functions: An agnostic proper learning algorithm for Lipschitz convex functions that achieves error $\varepsilon$ using $n^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ samples, together with a complementary lower bound of $n^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ samples in the \emph{correlational statistical query (CSQ)} model.
  - Testing Convex Functions: A tolerant (two-sided) tester for convexity of Lipschitz functions with the same sample complexity (as a corollary of our learning result), and a one-sided tester (which never rejects convex functions) using $O(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)^n$ samples.

<title>Experience-Guided Adaptation of Inference-Time Reasoning Strategies</title>

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

Abstract: We study randomized experiments in bipartite systems where only a subset of treatment-side units are eligible for assignment while all units continue to interact, generating interference. We formalize eligibility-constrained bipartite experiments and define estimands aligned with full deployment: the Primary Total Treatment Effect (PTTE) on eligible units and the Secondary Total Treatment Effect (STTE) on ineligible units. Under randomization within the eligible set, we give identification conditions and develop interference-aware ensemble estimators that combine exposure mappings, generalized propensity scores, and flexible machine learning. We further introduce a projection that links treatment- and outcome-level estimands; this mapping is exact under a Linear Additive Edges condition and enables estimation on the (typically much smaller) treatment side with deterministic aggregation to outcomes. In simulations with known ground truth across realistic exposure regimes, the proposed estimators recover PTTE and STTE with low bias and variance and reduce the bias that could arise when interference is ignored. Two field experiments illustrate practical relevance: our method corrects the direction of expected interference bias for a pre-specified metric in both studies and reverses the sign and significance of the primary decision metric in one case.

Abstract: It is an elementary fact in the scientific literature that the Lipschitz norm of the realization function of a feedforward fully-connected rectified linear unit (ReLU) artificial neural network (ANN) can, up to a multiplicative constant, be bounded from above by sums of powers of the norm of the ANN parameter vector. Roughly speaking, in this work we reveal in the case of shallow ANNs that the converse inequality is also true. More formally, we prove that the norm of the equivalence class of ANN parameter vectors with the same realization function is, up to a multiplicative constant, bounded from above by the sum of powers of the Lipschitz norm of the ANN realization function (with the exponents $ 1/2 $ and $ 1 $). Moreover, we prove that this upper bound only holds when employing the Lipschitz norm but does neither hold for H\"older norms nor for Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms. Furthermore, we prove that this upper bound only holds for sums of powers of the Lipschitz norm with the exponents $ 1/2 $ and $ 1 $ but does not hold for the Lipschitz norm alone.

Abstract: In general, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are evaluated by the generalization performance measured on unseen data excluded from the training phase. Along with the development of DNNs, the generalization performance converges to the state-of-the-art and it becomes difficult to evaluate DNNs solely based on this metric. The robustness against adversarial attack has been used as an additional metric to evaluate DNNs by measuring their vulnerability. However, few studies have been performed to analyze the adversarial robustness in terms of the geometry in DNNs. In this work, we perform an empirical study to analyze the internal properties of DNNs that affect model robustness under adversarial attacks. In particular, we propose the novel concept of the Populated Region Set (PRS), where training samples are populated more frequently, to represent the internal properties of DNNs in a practical setting. From systematic experiments with the proposed concept, we provide empirical evidence to validate that a low PRS ratio has a strong relationship with the adversarial robustness of DNNs. We also devise PRS regularizer leveraging the characteristics of PRS to improve the adversarial robustness without adversarial training.

Abstract: Neural Additive Models (NAMs) have recently demonstrated promising predictive performance while maintaining interpretability. However, their capacity is limited to capturing only first-order feature interactions, which restricts their effectiveness on real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose Higher-order Neural Additive Models (HONAMs), an interpretable machine learning model that effectively and efficiently captures feature interactions of arbitrary orders. HONAMs improve predictive accuracy without compromising interpretability, an essential requirement in high-stakes applications. This advantage of HONAM can help analyze and extract high-order interactions present in datasets. The source code for HONAM is publicly available at https://github.com/gim4855744/HONAM/.

Abstract: Over the past decade, deep learning has proven to be a highly effective tool for learning meaningful features from raw data. However, it remains an open question how deep networks perform hierarchical feature learning across layers. In this work, we attempt to unveil this mystery by investigating the structures of intermediate features. Motivated by our empirical findings that linear layers mimic the roles of deep layers in nonlinear networks for feature learning, we explore how deep linear networks transform input data into output by investigating the output (i.e., features) of each layer after training in the context of multi-class classification problems. Toward this goal, we first define metrics to measure within-class compression and between-class discrimination of intermediate features, respectively. Through theoretical analysis of these two metrics, we show that the evolution of features follows a simple and quantitative pattern from shallow to deep layers when the input data is nearly orthogonal and the network weights are minimum-norm, balanced, and approximate low-rank: Each layer of the linear network progressively compresses within-class features at a geometric rate and discriminates between-class features at a linear rate with respect to the number of layers that data have passed through. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative characterization of feature evolution in hierarchical representations of deep linear networks. Empirically, our extensive experiments not only validate our theoretical results numerically but also reveal a similar pattern in deep nonlinear networks which aligns well with recent empirical studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical implications of our results in transfer learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Heimine/PNC_DLN.

Abstract: Despite the demonstrated parameter efficiency of prompt-based fusion, its limited adaptivity and expressiveness hinder its effectiveness for multimodal applications at scale. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study addressing these limitations. Our key motivation is to ``divide and conquer'' the vanilla prompt, traditionally shared across all instances, by generating instance-specific prompts. Specifically, we propose the Mixture of Prompt Experts (MoPE), a framework that significantly enhances prompt adaptivity and expressiveness by dynamically generating instance-specific prompts. MoPE leverages multimodal pairings as additional evidence, allowing the model to adaptively select optimal prompts tailored to each individual instance. Unlike traditional prompt-fusion methods, which encounter scalability bottlenecks when optimizing long unified prompts, MoPE maintains fixed prompt length while effectively scaling the number of specialized experts. Moreover, we investigate regularization terms to encourage expert specialization, resulting in highly adaptive and interpretable prompting. MoPE fundamentally changes the scaling dynamic, unlocking greater expressiveness and adaptability to complex multimodal relationships, enabling the model to selectively attend to task-relevant sub-sequences based on instance-specific multimodal input. Extensive experiments across six multimodal datasets spanning four modalities demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for multimodal fusion, matching or surpassing the performance of fine-tuning while requiring only 0.8% of the trainable parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Partial Information Decomposition of Features (PIDF), a new paradigm for simultaneous data interpretability and feature selection. Contrary to traditional methods that assign a single importance value, our approach is based on three metrics per feature: the mutual information shared with the target variable, the feature's contribution to synergistic information, and the amount of this information that is redundant. In particular, we develop a novel procedure based on these three metrics, which reveals not only how features are correlated with the target but also the additional and overlapping information provided by considering them in combination with other features. We extensively evaluate PIDF using both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its potential applications and effectiveness, by considering case studies from genetics and neuroscience.

Abstract: Label smoothing is a widely studied regularization technique in machine learning. However, its potential for node classification in graph-structured data, spanning homophilic to heterophilic graphs, remains largely unexplored. We introduce posterior label smoothing, a novel method for transductive node classification that derives soft labels from a posterior distribution conditioned on neighborhood labels. The likelihood and prior distributions are estimated from the global statistics of the graph structure, allowing our approach to adapt naturally to various graph properties. We evaluate our method on 10 benchmark datasets using eight baseline models, demonstrating consistent improvements in classification accuracy. The following analysis demonstrates that soft labels mitigate overfitting during training, leading to better generalization performance, and that pseudo-labeling effectively refines the global label statistics of the graph.

Abstract: The maximal coding rate reduction (MCR$^2$) objective for learning structured and compact deep representations is drawing increasing attention, especially after its recent usage in the derivation of fully explainable and highly effective deep network architectures. However, it lacks a complete theoretical justification: only the properties of its global optima are known, and its global landscape has not been studied. In this work, we give a complete characterization of the properties of all its local and global optima, as well as other types of critical points. Specifically, we show that each (local or global) maximizer of the MCR$^2$ problem corresponds to a low-dimensional, discriminative, and diverse representation, and furthermore, each critical point of the objective is either a local maximizer or a strict saddle point. Such a favorable landscape makes MCR$^2$ a natural choice of objective for learning diverse and discriminative representations via first-order optimization methods. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.

Abstract: Spuriousness arises when there is an association between two or more variables in a dataset that are not causally related. In this work, we propose an explainability framework to preemptively disentangle the nature of such spurious associations in a dataset before model training. We leverage a body of work in information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to decompose the total information about the target into four non-negative quantities, namely unique information (in core and spurious features, respectively), redundant information, and synergistic information. Our framework helps anticipate when the core or spurious feature is indispensable, when either suffices, and when both are jointly needed for an optimal classifier trained on the dataset. Next, we leverage this decomposition to propose a novel measure of the spuriousness of a dataset. We arrive at this measure systematically by examining several candidate measures, and demonstrating what they capture and miss through intuitive canonical examples and counterexamples. Our framework Spurious Disentangler consists of segmentation, dimensionality reduction, and estimation modules, with capabilities to specifically handle high-dimensional image data efficiently. Finally, we also perform empirical evaluation to demonstrate the trends of unique, redundant, and synergistic information, as well as our proposed spuriousness measure across $6$ benchmark datasets under various experimental settings. We observe an agreement between our preemptive measure of dataset spuriousness and post-training model generalization metrics such as worst-group accuracy, further supporting our proposition. The code is available at https://github.com/Barproda/spuriousness-disentangler.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from a static target dataset. The performance of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms notwithstanding, it relies on the size of the target dataset, and it degrades if limited samples in the target dataset are available, which is often the case in real-world applications. To address this issue, domain adaptation that leverages auxiliary samples from related source datasets (such as simulators) can be beneficial. However, establishing the optimal way to trade off the limited target dataset and the large-but-biased source dataset while ensuring provably theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. To the best of our knowledge, this paper proposes the first framework that theoretically explores the impact of the weights assigned to each dataset on the performance of offline RL. In particular, we establish performance bounds and the existence of the optimal weight, which can be computed in closed form under simplifying assumptions. We also provide algorithmic guarantees in terms of convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Notably, these results depend on the quality of the source dataset and the number of samples in the target dataset. Our empirical results on the well-known offline Procgen benchmark substantiate the theoretical contributions in this work.

Abstract: This paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of the standard 2-layer MLP projection head featured in the SimCLR framework through the use of pretrained autoencoder embeddings. Given a contrastive learning task with a largely unlabeled image classification dataset, we first train a shallow autoencoder architecture and extract its compressed representations contained in the encoder's embedding layer. After freezing the weights within this pretrained layer, we use it as a drop-in replacement for the input layer of SimCLR's default projector. Additionally, we also apply further architectural changes to the projector by decreasing its width and changing its activation function. The different projection heads are then used to contrastively train and evaluate a feature extractor following the SimCLR protocol. Our experiments indicate that using a pretrained autoencoder embedding in the projector can not only increase classification accuracy by up to 2.9% or 1.7% on average, but can also significantly decrease the dimensionality of the projection space. Our results also suggest, that using the sigmoid and tanh activation functions within the projector can outperform ReLU in terms of peak and average classification accuracy. All experiments involving our pretrained projectors are conducted with frozen embeddings, since our test results indicate an advantage compared to using their non-frozen counterparts.

Abstract: The real-time solution of parametric optimization problems is critical for applications that demand high accuracy under tight real-time constraints, such as model predictive control. To this end, this work presents a learning-based iterative solver for constrained optimization, comprising a neural network predictor that generates initial primal-dual solution estimates, followed by a learned iterative solver that refines these estimates to reach high accuracy. We introduce a novel loss function based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, enabling fully self-supervised training without pre-sampled optimizer solutions. Theoretical guarantees ensure that the training loss function attains minima exclusively at KKT points. A convexification procedure enables application to nonconvex problems while preserving these guarantees. Experiments on two nonconvex case studies demonstrate speedups of up to one order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art solvers such as IPOPT, while achieving orders of magnitude higher accuracy than competing learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Policy design in non-stationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is inherently challenging due to the complexities introduced by time-varying system transition and reward, which make it difficult for learners to determine the optimal actions for maximizing cumulative future rewards. Fortunately, in many practical applications, such as energy systems, look-ahead predictions are available, including forecasts for renewable energy generation and demand. In this paper, we leverage these look-ahead predictions and propose an algorithm designed to achieve low regret in non-stationary MDPs by incorporating such predictions. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under certain assumptions, the regret decreases exponentially as the look-ahead window expands. When the system prediction is subject to error, the regret does not explode even if the prediction error grows sub-exponentially as a function of the prediction horizon. We validate our approach through simulations, confirming the efficacy of our algorithm in non-stationary environments.

Abstract: AfterLearnER (After Learning Evolutionary Retrofitting) consists in applying evolutionary optimization to refine fully trained machine learning models by optimizing a set of carefully chosen parameters or hyperparameters of the model, with respect to some actual, exact, and hence possibly non-differentiable error signal, performed on a subset of the standard validation set. The efficiency of AfterLearnER is demonstrated by tackling non-differentiable signals such as threshold-based criteria in depth sensing, the word error rate in speech re-synthesis, the number of kills per life at Doom, computational accuracy or BLEU in code translation, image quality in 3D generative adversarial networks (GANs), and user feedback in image generation via Latent Diffusion Models (LDM). This retrofitting can be done after training, or dynamically at inference time by taking into account the user feedback. The advantages of AfterLearnER are its versatility, the possibility to use non-differentiable feedback, including human evaluations (i.e., no gradient is needed), the limited overfitting supported by a theoretical study, and its anytime behavior. Last but not least, AfterLearnER requires only a small amount of feedback, i.e., a few dozen to a few hundred scalars, compared to the tens of thousands needed in most related published works.

<title>SGLP: A Similarity Guided Fast Layer Partition Pruning for Compressing Large Deep Models</title>

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a potent approach to remove redundant layers in the pre-trained network on the purpose of reducing network size and improve computational efficiency. However, existing layer pruning methods mostly overlook the intrinsic connections and inter-dependencies between different layers within complicated deep neural networks. This oversight can result in pruned models that do not preserve the essential characteristics of the pre-trained network as effectively as desired. To address these limitations, we propose a Similarity-Guided Layer Partition (SGLP) Pruning, a novel pruning framework that exploits representation similarity to guide efficient and informed layer removal for compressing large deep models. Our method begins by employing Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to quantify representational similarity between layers, uncovering structural patterns within the network. We then apply Fisher Optimal Segmentation on the similarity matrix to partition the network into semantically coherent layer segments. This segmentation allows pruning decisions to respect layer interdependencies and preserve essential knowledge. Within each segment, we introduce a fine-tuning-free importance evaluation using GradNorm, identifying and removing redundant layers in a targeted, segment-wise manner. Experimental results on both image classification tasks and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that our proposed SGLP outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency. Our approach achieves significant model compression with minimal performance degradation, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is pivotal for intelligent transportation systems, where accurate and interpretable predictions can significantly enhance operational efficiency and safety. A key challenge stems from the heterogeneity of traffic conditions across diverse locations, leading to highly varied traffic data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) show exceptional promise for few-shot learning in such dynamic and data-sparse scenarios. However, existing LLM-based solutions often rely on prompt-tuning, which can struggle to fully capture complex graph relationships and spatiotemporal dependencies-thereby limiting adaptability and interpretability in real-world traffic networks. We address these gaps by introducing Strada-LLM, a novel multivariate probabilistic forecasting LLM that explicitly models both temporal and spatial traffic patterns. By incorporating proximal traffic information as covariates, Strada-LLM more effectively captures local variations and outperforms prompt-based existing LLMs. To further enhance adaptability, we propose a lightweight distribution-derived strategy for domain adaptation, enabling parameter-efficient model updates when encountering new data distributions or altered network topologies-even under few-shot constraints. Empirical evaluations on spatio-temporal transportation datasets demonstrate that Strada-LLM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-driven and traditional GNN-based predictors. Specifically, it improves long-term forecasting by 17% in RMSE error and 16% more efficiency. Moreover, it maintains robust performance across different LLM backbones with minimal degradation, making it a versatile and powerful solution for real-world traffic prediction tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of stochastic latent heterogeneity in online decision-making, where individuals' responses to actions vary not only with observable contexts but also with unobserved, randomly realized subgroups. Existing data-driven approaches largely capture observable heterogeneity through contextual features but fail when the sources of variation are latent and stochastic. We propose a latent heterogeneous bandit framework that explicitly models probabilistic subgroup membership and group-specific reward functions, using promotion targeting as a motivating example. Our phased EM-greedy algorithm jointly learns latent group probabilities and reward parameters in high dimensions, achieving optimal estimation and classification guarantees. Our analysis reveals a new phenomenon unique to decision-making with stochastic latent subgroups: randomness in group realizations creates irreducible classification uncertainty, making sub-linear regret against a fully informed strong oracle fundamentally impossible. We establish matching upper and minimax lower bounds for both the strong and regular regrets, corresponding, respectively, to oracles with and without access to realized group memberships. The strong regret necessarily grows linearly, while the regular regret achieves a minimax-optimal sublinear rate. These findings uncover a fundamental stochastic barrier in online decision-making and point to potential remedies through simple strategic interventions and mechanism-design-based elicitation of latent information.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown promising results for several domains such as materials science, chemistry, and the social sciences. GNN models often contain millions of parameters, and like other neural network (NN) models, are often fed only a fraction of the graphs that make up the training dataset in batches to update model parameters. The effect of batching algorithms on training time and model performance has been thoroughly explored for NNs but not yet for GNNs. We analyze two different batching algorithms for graph based models, namely static and dynamic batching for two datasets, the QM9 dataset of small molecules and the AFLOW materials database. Our experiments show that changing the batching algorithm can provide up to a 2.7x speedup, but the fastest algorithm depends on the data, model, batch size, hardware, and number of training steps run. Experiments show that for a select number of combinations of batch size, dataset, and model, significant differences in model learning metrics are observed between static and dynamic batching algorithms.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks. The official code is released at https://github.com/research4pan/AdaptPruner.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to accelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data often necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing major challenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose LLMs for cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it limits the rapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated through experiments and research. Compounding these challenges is the fact that real-world scientific questions are typically complex and open-ended, requiring reasoning beyond pattern matching or static knowledge retrieval.To address these challenges, we propose CLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored to drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents, CLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases, contextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate responses - all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially, we tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data, including data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a variety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Genentech/CLADD.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, where users can request the deletion of a forget dataset, is becoming increasingly important because of numerous privacy regulations. Initial works on ``exact'' unlearning (e.g., retraining) incur large computational overheads. However, while computationally inexpensive, ``approximate'' methods have fallen short of reaching the effectiveness of exact unlearning: models produced fail to obtain comparable accuracy and prediction confidence on both the forget and test (i.e., unseen) dataset. Exploiting this observation, we propose a new unlearning method, Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), that outperforms prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for image classification. AMUN lowers the confidence of the model on the forget samples by fine-tuning the model on their corresponding adversarial examples. Adversarial examples naturally belong to the distribution imposed by the model on the input space; fine-tuning the model on the adversarial examples closest to the corresponding forget samples (a) localizes the changes to the decision boundary of the model around each forget sample and (b) avoids drastic changes to the global behavior of the model, thereby preserving the model's accuracy on test samples. Using AMUN for unlearning a random $10\%$ of CIFAR-10 samples, we observe that even SOTA membership inference attacks cannot do better than random guessing.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated settings enables privacy-preserving adaptation but suffers from cross-client interference due to model aggregation. Existing federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, primarily based on FedAvg, struggle with data heterogeneity, leading to harmful cross-client interference and suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose \textbf{FedALT}, a novel personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning algorithm that fundamentally departs from FedAvg. Instead of using an aggregated model to initialize local training, each client continues training its individual LoRA while incorporating shared knowledge through a separate Rest-of-World (RoW) LoRA component. To effectively balance local adaptation and global information, FedALT introduces an adaptive mixer that dynamically learns input-specific weightings between the individual and RoW LoRA components, drawing conceptual foundations from the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm. Through extensive experiments on NLP benchmarks, we demonstrate that FedALT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, achieving superior local adaptation without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Optimizing the mining process -- particularly truck dispatch scheduling -- is a key driver of efficiency in open-pit operations. However, the dynamic and stochastic nature of these environments, with uncertainties such as equipment failures, truck maintenance, and variable haul cycle times, challenges traditional optimization. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows strong potential for adaptive decision-making in mining logistics, practical deployment requires evaluation in realistic, customizable simulation environments. The lack of standardized benchmarking hampers fair algorithm comparison, reproducibility, and real-world applicability of RL solutions.
  To address this, we present Mining-Gym -- a configurable, open-source benchmarking environment for training, testing, and evaluating RL algorithms in mining process optimization. Built on Salabim-based Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and integrated with Gymnasium, Mining-Gym captures mining-specific uncertainties through an event-driven decision-point architecture. It offers a GUI for parameter configuration, data logging, and real-time visualization, supporting reproducible evaluation of RL strategies and heuristic baselines.
  We validate Mining-Gym by comparing classical heuristics with RL-based scheduling across six scenarios from normal operation to severe equipment failures. Results show it is an effective, reproducible testbed, enabling fair evaluation of adaptive decision-making and demonstrating the strong performance potential of RL-trained schedulers.

<title>Gaussian Process Tilted Nonparametric Density Estimation using Fisher Divergence Score Matching</title>

Abstract: We propose a nonparametric density estimator based on the Gaussian process (GP) and derive three novel closed form learning algorithms based on Fisher divergence (FD) score matching. The density estimator is formed by multiplying a base multivariate normal distribution with an exponentiated GP refinement, and so we refer to it as a GP-tilted nonparametric density. By representing the GP part of the score as a linear function using the random Fourier feature (RFF) approximation, we show that optimization can be solved in closed form for the three FD-based objectives considered. This includes the basic and noise conditional versions of the Fisher divergence, as well as an alternative to noise conditional FD models based on variational inference (VI) that we propose in this paper. For this novel learning approach, we propose an ELBO-like optimization to approximate the posterior distribution, with which we then derive a Fisher variational predictive distribution. The RFF representation of the GP, which is functionally equivalent to a single layer neural network score model with cosine activation, provides a useful linear representation of the GP for which all expectations can be solved. The Gaussian base distribution also helps with tractability of the VI approximation and ensures that our proposed density is well-defined. We demonstrate our three learning algorithms, as well as a MAP baseline algorithm, on several low dimensional density estimation problems. The closed form nature of the learning problem removes the reliance on iterative learning algorithms, making this technique particularly well-suited to big data sets, since only sufficient statistics collected from a single pass through the data is needed.

Abstract: We exploit the observation that stochastic variational inference (SVI) is a form of annealing and present a modified SVI approach -- applicable to both large and small datasets -- that allows the amount of annealing done by SVI to be tuned. We are motivated by the fact that, in SVI, the larger the batch size the more approximately Gaussian is the noise of the gradient, but the smaller its variance, which reduces the amount of annealing done to escape bad local optimal solutions. We propose a simple method for achieving both goals of having larger variance noise to escape bad local optimal solutions and more data information to obtain more accurate gradient directions. The idea is to set an actual batch size, which may be the size of the data set, and an effective batch size that matches the increased variance of a smaller batch size. The result is an approximation to the maximum entropy stochastic gradient at a desired variance level. We theoretically motivate our ``SVI+'' approach for conjugate exponential family model framework and illustrate its empirical performance for learning the probabilistic matrix factorization collaborative filter (PMF), the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model (LDA), and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM).

<title>Beyond $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Constraint Violation for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints</title>

Abstract: We study Online Convex Optimization with adversarial constraints (COCO). At each round a learner selects an action from a convex decision set and then an adversary reveals a convex cost and a convex constraint function. The goal of the learner is to select a sequence of actions to minimize both regret and the cumulative constraint violation (CCV) over a horizon of length $T$. The best-known policy for this problem achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV. In this paper, we improve this by trading off regret to achieve substantially smaller CCV. This trade-off is especially important in safety-critical applications, where satisfying the safety constraints is non-negotiable. Specifically, for any bounded convex cost and constraint functions, we propose an online policy that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT}+ T^\beta)$ regret and $\tilde{O}(dT^{1-\beta})$ CCV, where $d$ is the dimension of the decision set and $\beta \in [0,1]$ is a tunable parameter. We begin with a special case, called the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem, where the decision set is a probability simplex and the cost and constraint functions are linear. Leveraging a new adaptive small-loss regret bound, we propose a computationally efficient policy for the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem, that attains $O(\sqrt{T\ln N}+T^{\beta})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta} \ln N)$ CCV for $N$ number of experts. The original problem is then reduced to the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem via a covering argument. Finally, with an additional $M$-smoothness assumption, we propose a computationally efficient first-order policy attaining $O(\sqrt{MT}+T^{\beta})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(MT^{1-\beta})$ CCV.

Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of Earth system dynamics is fundamentally limited by instabilities in current artificial intelligence (AI) models during extended autoregressive simulations. These failures often originate from inherent spectral bias, leading to inadequate representation of critical high-frequency, small-scale processes and subsequent uncontrolled error amplification. Inspired by the nested grids in numerical models used to resolve small scales, we present TritonCast. At the core of its design is a dedicated latent dynamical core, which ensures the long-term stability of the macro-evolution at a coarse scale. An outer structure then fuses this stable trend with fine-grained local details. This design effectively mitigates the spectral bias caused by cross-scale interactions. In atmospheric science, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the WeatherBench 2 benchmark while demonstrating exceptional long-term stability: executing year-long autoregressive global forecasts and completing multi-year climate simulations that span the entire available $2500$-day test period without drift. In oceanography, it extends skillful eddy forecast to $120$ days and exhibits unprecedented zero-shot cross-resolution generalization. Ablation studies reveal that this performance stems from the synergistic interplay of the architecture's core components. TritonCast thus offers a promising pathway towards a new generation of trustworthy, AI-driven simulations. This significant advance has the potential to accelerate discovery in climate and Earth system science, enabling more reliable long-term forecasting and deeper insights into complex geophysical dynamics.

Abstract: Continual Learning with Pre-trained Models holds great promise for efficient adaptation across sequential tasks. However, most existing approaches freeze PTMs and rely on auxiliary modules like prompts or adapters, limiting model plasticity and leading to suboptimal generalization when facing significant distribution shifts. While full fine-tuning can improve adaptability, it risks disrupting crucial pre-trained knowledge. In this paper, we propose Mutual Information-guided Sparse Tuning (MIST), a plug-and-play method that selectively updates a small subset of PTM parameters, less than 5%, based on sensitivity to mutual information objectives. MIST enables effective task-specific adaptation while preserving generalization. To further reduce interference, we introduce strong sparsity regularization by randomly dropping gradients during tuning, resulting in fewer than 0.5% of parameters being updated per step. Applied before standard freeze-based methods, MIST consistently boosts performance across diverse continual learning benchmarks. Experiments show that integrating our method into multiple baselines yields significant performance gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhwhu/MIST.

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is an established approach for performing Bayesian inference on scientific simulators. SBI so far works best on low-dimensional parametric models. However, it is difficult to infer function-valued parameters, which frequently occur in disciplines that model spatiotemporal processes such as the climate and earth sciences. Here, we introduce an approach for efficient posterior estimation, using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) architecture with a flow matching objective. We show that our approach, FNOPE, can perform inference of function-valued parameters at a fraction of the simulation budget of state of the art methods. In addition, FNOPE supports posterior evaluation at arbitrary discretizations of the domain, as well as simultaneous estimation of vector-valued parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark tasks and a challenging spatial inference task from glaciology. FNOPE extends the applicability of SBI methods to new scientific domains by enabling the inference of function-valued parameters.

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Optimism, a framework for substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism, as a variant of Optimism, adaptively controls the learning pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner to accelerate no-regret learning dynamics. Cautious Optimism takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm (COFTRL) by pacing the underlying FTRL with minimal computational overhead. Importantly, it retains uncoupledness, that is, learners do not need to know other players' utilities. Cautious Optimistic FTRL (COFTRL) achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play (mixing and matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O_T(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g., Syrgkanis et al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic step sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games. Moreover, instances of COFTRL achieve new state-of-the-art regret minimization guarantees in general convex games, exponentially improving the dependence on the dimension of the action space $d$ over previous works [Farina et al., 2022a].

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff$\text{'}$s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids) we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in urban spatiotemporal forecasting, such as predicting infrastructure problems. In this setting, government officials wish to know in which neighborhoods incidents like potholes or rodent issues occur. The true state of incidents (e.g., street conditions) for each neighborhood is observed via government inspection ratings. However, these ratings are only conducted for a sparse set of neighborhoods and incident types. We also observe the state of incidents via crowdsourced reports, which are more densely observed but may be biased due to heterogeneous reporting behavior. First, for such settings, we propose a multiview, multioutput GNN-based model that uses both unbiased rating data and biased reporting data to predict the true latent state of incidents. Second, we investigate a case study of New York City urban incidents and collect, standardize, and make publicly available a dataset of 9,615,863 crowdsourced reports and 1,041,415 government inspection ratings over 3 years and across 139 types of incidents. Finally, we show on both real and semi-synthetic data that our model can better predict the latent state compared to models that use only reporting data or models that use only rating data, especially when rating data is sparse and reports are predictive of ratings. We also quantify demographic biases in crowdsourced reporting, e.g., higher-income neighborhoods report problems at higher rates. Our analysis showcases a widely applicable approach for latent state prediction using heterogeneous, sparse, and biased data.

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful signals. We introduce SPLINCE-Simultaneous Projection for LINear concept removal and Covariance prEservation - which eliminates sensitive concepts from representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label. SPLINCE achieves this via an oblique projection that 'splices out' the unwanted direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLINCE outperforms baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows, induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii) the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed behaviors.

Abstract: Efficient and controllable data unlearning in federated learning remains challenging, due to the trade-off between forgetting and retention performance. Especially under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings, where deep feature entanglement exacerbates this dilemma. To address this challenge, we propose FedOrtho, a federated unlearning framework that combines orthogonalized deep convolutional kernels with an activation-driven controllable one-shot soft pruning (OSP) mechanism. FedOrtho enforces kernel orthogonality and local-global alignment to decouple feature representations and mitigate client drift. This structural independence enables precise one-shot pruning of forgetting-related kernels while preserving retained knowledge. FedOrtho achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet with ResNet and VGG frameworks, verifying that FedOrtho supports class-, client-, and sample-level unlearning with over 98% forgetting quality. It reduces computational and communication costs by 2-3 orders of magnitude in federated settings and achieves subsecond-level erasure in centralized scenarios while maintaining over 97% retention accuracy and mitigating membership inference risks.

Abstract: In this paper, we reveal a significant shortcoming in class unlearning evaluations: overlooking the underlying class geometry can cause privacy leakage. We further propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate this issue. We introduce a membership-inference attack via nearest neighbors (MIA-NN) that uses the probabilities the model assigns to neighboring classes to detect unlearned samples. Our experiments show that existing unlearning methods are vulnerable to MIA-NN across multiple datasets. We then propose a new fine-tuning objective that mitigates this privacy leakage by approximating, for forget-class inputs, the distribution over the remaining classes that a retrained-from-scratch model would produce. To construct this approximation, we estimate inter-class similarity and tilt the target model's distribution accordingly. The resulting Tilted ReWeighting (TRW) distribution serves as the desired distribution during fine-tuning. We also show that across multiple benchmarks, TRW matches or surpasses existing unlearning methods on prior unlearning metrics. More specifically, on CIFAR-10, it reduces the gap with retrained models by 19% and 46% for U-LiRA and MIA-NN scores, accordingly, compared to the SOTA method for each category.

Abstract: Muon, a recently proposed optimizer that leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters, has demonstrated strong empirical performance, indicating its potential as a successor to standard optimizers such as AdamW. This paper presents theoretical analysis to support its practical success. We provide convergence proofs for Muon across four practical settings, systematically examining its behavior with and without the inclusion of Nesterov momentum and weight decay. Our analysis covers the standard configuration using both, thereby elucidating its real-world performance. We then demonstrate that the addition of weight decay yields strictly tighter theoretical bounds and clarify the interplay between the weight decay coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive the critical batch size for Muon that minimizes the computational cost of training. Our analysis identifies the hyperparameters governing this value, and our experiments validate the corresponding theoretical findings across workloads including image classification and language modeling task.

<title>RetrySQL: text-to-SQL training with retry data for self-correcting query generation</title>

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing. Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines. While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL, a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill. Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters. RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented language models.

<title>NTSFormer: A Self-Teaching Graph Transformer for Multimodal Isolated Cold-Start Node Classification</title>

Abstract: Isolated cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because such nodes have no edges and often have missing modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) for isolated cold-start inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However, this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student" prediction based only on self information (i.e., the node's own features), and a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature data into token sequences, which are then processed by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion. Experiments on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior performance for multimodal isolated cold-start node classification.

<title>First-Order Error Matters: Accurate Compensation for Quantized Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by performing a first-order Taylor expansion around the pre-quantization weights. This yields an approximation based on the difference between latent and full-precision weights as well as the Hessian matrix. When substituted into the theoretical solution, the formulation eliminates the need to explicitly compute the Hessian, thereby avoiding the high computational cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient methods. This design introduces only minimal additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 17.3% and increases the 5-shot MMLU accuracy from 53.8% achieved by GPTAQ to 56.1%. Moreover, FOEM can be seamlessly combined with advanced techniques such as SpinQuant, delivering additional gains under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting and further narrowing the performance gap with full-precision baselines, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security. However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from historical trends. We attribute this to the lack of rich, physically grounded datasets directly linking atmospheric states to yields. To address this, we introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer for Asymmetric Data), a variational pretraining framework that learns representations from large satellite-based weather datasets and transfers to the ground-based limited measurements available for yield prediction. VITA is trained using detailed meteorological variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict latent atmospheric states under a seasonality-aware sinusoidal prior. This allows the model to be fine-tuned using limited weather statistics during deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the US Corn Belt, VITA achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all evaluation scenarios, particularly during extreme years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, p < 0.0001). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN without soil data, and larger foundational models (e.g., Chronos-Bolt) with less compute, making it practical for real-world use, especially in data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a changing climate.

Abstract: In this work, we employ physics-informed neural operators to map pressure profiles from an input function space to the corresponding bubble radius responses. Our approach employs a two-step DeepONet architecture. To address the intrinsic spectral bias of deep learning models, our model incorporates the Rowdy adaptive activation function, enhancing the representation of high-frequency features. Moreover, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) based two-step DeepOKAN model, which enhances interpretability (often lacking in conventional multilayer perceptron architectures) while efficiently capturing high-frequency bubble dynamics without explicit utilization of activation functions in any form. We particularly investigate the use of spline basis functions in combination with radial basis functions (RBF) within our architecture, as they demonstrate superior performance in constructing a universal basis for approximating high-frequency bubble dynamics compared to alternative formulations. Furthermore, we emphasize on the performance bottleneck of RBF while learning the high frequency bubble dynamics and showcase the advantage of using spline basis function for the trunk network in overcoming this inherent spectral bias. The model is systematically evaluated across three representative scenarios: (1) bubble dynamics governed by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation with a single initial radius, (2) bubble dynamics governed by the Keller-Miksis equation with a single initial radius, and (3) Keller-Miksis dynamics with multiple initial radii. We also compare our results with state-of-the-art neural operators, including Fourier Neural Operators, Wavelet Neural Operators, OFormer, and Convolutional Neural Operators. Our findings demonstrate that the two-step DeepOKAN accurately captures both low- and high-frequency behaviors, and offers a promising alternative to conventional numerical solvers.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PrivDFS, a distributed feature-sharing framework for input-private inference in image classification. A single holistic intermediate representation in split inference gives diffusion-based Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) sufficient signal to reconstruct the input with high fidelity. PrivDFS restructures this vulnerability by fragmenting the representation and processing the fragments independently across a majority-honest set of servers. As a result, each branch observes only an incomplete and reconstruction-insufficient view of the input. To realize this, PrivDFS employs learnable binary masks that partition the intermediate representation into sparse and largely non-overlapping feature shares, each processed by a separate server, while a lightweight fusion module aggregates their predictions on the client. This design preserves full task accuracy when all branches are combined, yet sharply limits the reconstructive power available to any individual server. PrivDFS applies seamlessly to both ResNet-based CNNs and Vision Transformers. Across CIFAR-10/100, CelebA, and ImageNet-1K, PrivDFS induces a pronounced collapse in DRA performance, e.g., on CIFAR-10, PSNR drops from 23.25 -> 12.72 and SSIM from 0.963 -> 0.260, while maintaining accuracy within 1% of non-private split inference. These results establish structural feature partitioning as a practical and architecture-agnostic approach to reducing reconstructive leakage in cloud-based vision inference.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention for node classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, traditional GNNs primarily focus on adjacency relationships between nodes, often overlooking the role-based characteristics that can provide complementary insights for learning expressive node representations. Existing frameworks for extracting role-based features are largely unsupervised and often fail to translate effectively into downstream predictive tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a hypergraph neural network with a state space model (HGMN). The model integrates role-aware representations into GNNs by combining hypergraph construction with state-space modeling in a principled manner. HGMN employs hypergraph construction techniques to capture higher-order relationships and leverages a learnable mamba transformer mechanism to fuse role-based and adjacency-based embeddings. By exploring two distinct hypergraph construction strategies, degree-based and neighborhood-based, the framework reinforces connectivity among nodes with structural similarity, thereby enriching the learned representations. Furthermore, the inclusion of hypergraph convolution layers enables the model to account for complex dependencies within hypergraph structures. To alleviate the over-smoothing problem encountered in deeper networks, we incorporate residual connections, which improve stability and promote effective feature propagation across layers. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets including OGB, ACM, DBLP, IIP TerroristRel, Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed demonstrate that HGMN consistently outperforms strong baselines in node classification tasks. These results support the claim that explicitly incorporating role-based features within a hypergraph framework offers tangible benefits for node classification tasks.

<title>On the notion of missingness for path attribution explainability methods in medical settings: Guiding the selection of medically meaningful baselines</title>

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge, particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated Gradients rely on a baseline representing the absence of relevant features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts. While alternative baseline choices have been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of missingness in the medical context, analyze its implications for baseline selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a generated counterfactual (i.e. clinically "normal" variation of the pathological input) represents a more accurate representation of a meaningful absence of features. We use a Variational Autoencoder in our implementation, though our concept is model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable counterfactual method. We evaluate our concept on three distinct medical data sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions, outperforming standard baseline choices as well as other related methods.

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data, leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats, limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers, without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning (AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved an average AUT improvement of 8.66 and 10.90 for the classification-only and classification-rejection policies, respectively. Our results demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic setting of Android malware detection.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold, rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the operational model.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial value problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence, improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and pretrained models are available in https://github.com/arthur-bizzi/neusa.

Abstract: Spin coating polymer thin films to achieve specific mechanical properties is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. We present a framework that integrates an active Pareto front learning algorithm (PyePAL) with visualization and explainable AI techniques to optimize processing parameters. PyePAL uses Gaussian process models to predict objective values (hardness and elasticity) from the design variables (spin speed, dilution, and polymer mixture), guiding the adaptive selection of samples toward promising regions of the design space. To enable interpretable insights into the high-dimensional design space, we utilize UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for two-dimensional visualization of the Pareto front exploration. Additionally, we incorporate fuzzy linguistic summaries, which translate the learned relationships between process parameters and performance objectives into linguistic statements, thus enhancing the explainability and understanding of the optimization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method efficiently identifies promising polymer designs, while the visual and linguistic explanations facilitate expert-driven analysis and knowledge discovery.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3) identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised, and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs 0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67). Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants (GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63, AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without retraining the router. The code is available at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation) from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point. Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints) counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically interpret practical "hard-example up-weighting" modifications to GRPO as reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Abstract: This report presents Pelican-VL 1.0, a new family of open-source embodied brain models with parameter scales ranging from 7 billion to 72 billion. Our explicit mission is clearly stated as: To embed powerful intelligence into various embodiments. Pelican-VL 1.0 is currently the largest-scale open-source embodied multimodal brain model. Its core advantage lies in the in-depth integration of data power and intelligent adaptive learning mechanisms. Specifically, metaloop distilled a high-quality dataset from a raw dataset containing 4+ billion tokens. Pelican-VL 1.0 is trained on a large-scale cluster of 1000+ A800 GPUs, consuming over 50k+ A800 GPU-hours per checkpoint. This translates to a 20.3% performance uplift from its base model and outperforms 100B-level open-source counterparts by 10.6%, placing it on par with leading proprietary systems on well-known embodied benchmarks. We establish a novel framework, DPPO (Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization), inspired by human metacognition to train Pelican-VL 1.0. We operationalize this as a metaloop that teaches the AI to practice deliberately, which is a RL-Refine-Diagnose-SFT loop.

Abstract: For deep learning problems on graph-structured data, pooling layers are important for down sampling, reducing computational cost, and to minimize overfitting. We define a pooling layer, nervePool, for data structured as simplicial complexes, which are generalizations of graphs that include higher-dimensional simplices beyond vertices and edges; this structure allows for greater flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships. The proposed simplicial coarsening scheme is built upon partitions of vertices, which allow us to generate hierarchical representations of simplicial complexes, collapsing information in a learned fashion. NervePool builds on the learned vertex cluster assignments and extends to coarsening of higher dimensional simplices in a deterministic fashion. While in practice the pooling operations are computed via a series of matrix operations, the topological motivation is a set-theoretic construction based on unions of stars of simplices and the nerve complex.

Abstract: In contrast to biological neural circuits, conventional artificial neural networks are commonly organized as strictly hierarchical architectures that exclude direct connections among neurons within the same layer. Consequently, information flow is primarily confined to feedforward and feedback pathways across layers, which limits lateral interactions and constrains the potential for intra-layer information integration. We introduce an artificial neural network featuring intra-layer connections among hidden neurons to overcome this limitation. Owing to the proposed method for facilitating intra-layer connections, the model is theoretically anticipated to achieve faster convergence compared to conventional feedforward neural networks. The experimental findings provide further validation of the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Delayed Markov decision processes (DMDPs) fulfill the Markov property by augmenting the state space of agents with a finite time window of recently committed actions. In reliance on these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featuring observation or action delays. Although such methods can be directly trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources, or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in modeling the robot or environment dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied to the system input. We introduce the disturbance-augmented Markov decision process (DAMDP) in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning robotic reaching and pushing tasks and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer.

arXiv:2403.02912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of differentially-private (DP) stochastic (convex-concave) saddle-points in the $\ell_1$ setting. We propose $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithms based on stochastic mirror descent that attain nearly dimension-independent convergence rates for the expected duality gap, a type of guarantee that was known before only for bilinear objectives. For convex-concave and first-order-smooth stochastic objectives, our algorithms attain a rate of $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + (\log(d)^{3/2}/[n\varepsilon])^{1/3}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem and $n$ the dataset size. Under an additional second-order-smoothness assumption, we show that the duality gap is bounded by $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \log(d)/\sqrt{n\varepsilon}$ with high probability, by using bias-reduced gradient estimators. This rate provides evidence of the near-optimality of our approach, since a lower bound of $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \log(d)^{3/4}/\sqrt{n\varepsilon}$ exists. Finally, we show that combining our methods with acceleration techniques from online learning leads to the first algorithm for DP Stochastic Convex Optimization in the $\ell_1$ setting that is not based on Frank-Wolfe methods. For convex and first-order-smooth stochastic objectives, our algorithms attain an excess risk of $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \log(d)^{7/10}/[n\varepsilon]^{2/5}$, and when additionally assuming second-order-smoothness, we improve the rate to $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \log(d)/\sqrt{n\varepsilon}$. Instrumental to all of these results are various extensions of the classical Maurey Sparsification Lemma \cite{Pisier:1980}, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) plays a central role in modern machine learning as a flexible framework for feature extraction. We introduce a horseshoe-type prior with a latent Polya-Gamma scale mixture representation, yielding scalable algorithms for both point estimation via expectation-maximization (EM) and full posterior inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This hierarchical formulation unifies several previously disparate estimation strategies within a single Bayesian framework. We also establish the first theoretical guarantees for hierarchical Bayesian ICA, including posterior contraction and local asymptotic normality results for the unmixing matrix. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that our methods perform competitively with widely used ICA tools. We further discuss implementation of conditional posteriors, envelope-based optimization, and possible extensions to flow-based architectures for nonlinear feature extraction and deep learning. Finally, we outline several promising directions for future work.

Abstract: The activation function plays a crucial role in model optimisation, yet the optimal choice remains unclear. For example, the Sigmoid activation is the de-facto activation in balanced classification tasks, however, in imbalanced classification, it proves inappropriate due to bias towards frequent classes. In this work, we delve deeper in this phenomenon by performing a comprehensive statistical analysis in the classification and intermediate layers of both balanced and imbalanced networks and we empirically show that aligning the activation function with the data distribution, enhances the performance in both balanced and imbalanced tasks. To this end, we propose the Adaptive Parametric Activation (APA) function, a novel and versatile activation function that unifies most common activation functions under a single formula. APA can be applied in both intermediate layers and attention layers, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art on several imbalanced benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist2018, Places-LT, CIFAR100-LT and LVIS. Also, we extend APA to a plethora of other tasks such as classification, detection, visual instruction following tasks, image generation and next-text-token prediction benchmarks. APA increases the performance in multiple benchmarks across various model architectures. The code is available at https://github.com/kostas1515/AGLU.

Abstract: A distribution shift between the training and test data can severely harm performance of machine learning models. Importance weighting addresses this issue by assigning different weights to data points during training. We argue that existing heuristics for determining the weights are suboptimal, as they neglect the increase of the variance of the estimated model due to the finite sample size of the training data. We interpret the optimal weights in terms of a bias-variance trade-off, and propose a bi-level optimization procedure in which the weights and model parameters are optimized simultaneously. We apply this optimization to existing importance weighting techniques for last-layer retraining of deep neural networks in the presence of sub-population shifts and show empirically that optimizing weights significantly improves generalization performance.

Abstract: The rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DERs) presents both opportunities and operational challenges for electric grid management. Accurately predicting DER adoption is critical for proactive infrastructure planning, but the inherent uncertainty and spatial disparity of DER growth complicate traditional forecasting approaches. Moreover, the hierarchical structure of distribution grids demands that predictions satisfy statistical guarantees at both the circuit and substation levels, a non-trivial requirement for reliable decision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty quantification framework for DER adoption predictions that ensures validity across hierarchical grid structures. Leveraging a multivariate Hawkes process to model DER adoption dynamics and a tailored split conformal prediction algorithm, we introduce a new nonconformity score that preserves statistical guarantees under aggregation while maintaining prediction efficiency. We establish theoretical validity under mild conditions and demonstrate through empirical evaluation on customer-level solar panel installation data from Indianapolis, Indiana that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration.

Abstract: Image segmentation foundation models (SFMs) like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive zero-shot and interactive segmentation across diverse domains. However, they struggle to segment objects with certain structures, particularly those with dense, tree-like morphology and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are crucial for understanding the limitations of SFMs in real-world applications. To systematically study this issue, we introduce interpretable metrics quantifying object tree-likeness and textural separability. On carefully controlled synthetic experiments and real-world datasets, we show that SFM performance (\eg, SAM, SAM 2, HQ-SAM) noticeably correlates with these factors. We attribute these failures to SFMs misinterpreting local structure as global texture, resulting in over-segmentation or difficulty distinguishing objects from similar backgrounds. Notably, targeted fine-tuning fails to resolve this issue, indicating a fundamental limitation. Our study provides the first quantitative framework for modeling the behavior of SFMs on challenging structures, offering interpretable insights into their segmentation capabilities.

Abstract: The discovery of symbolic solutions -- mathematical expressions, logical rules, and algorithmic structures -- is fundamental to advancing scientific and engineering progress.
  However, traditional methods often struggle with search efficiency and fail to integrate knowledge effectively.
  While recent large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches have demonstrated improvements in search efficiency, they lack the ability to continually refine and expand upon discovered solutions and their underlying knowledge, limiting their potential for open-ended innovation.
  To address these limitations, we introduce CoEvo, a novel framework that leverages large language models within an evolutionary search methodology to continually generate and refine symbolic solutions. CoEvo integrates a dynamic knowledge library, enabling open-ended innovation of solutions through effective knowledge management. Additionally, CoEvo leverages multiple representations of solutions -- including natural language, mathematical expressions, and code -- to further enhance search efficiency.
  By combining the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the exploratory power of evolutionary algorithms, CoEvo significantly improves the efficiency and scope of symbolic discovery.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative
  process, marking a significant step towards harnessing LLMs in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

Abstract: The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) has significantly advanced visuomotor policy learning. However, effectively leveraging these models remains a challenge. We identify temporal entanglement as a critical, inherent issue when using these time-invariant models in sequential decision-making tasks. This entanglement arises because PVRs, optimised for static image understanding, struggle to represent the temporal dependencies crucial for visuomotor control. In this work, we quantify the impact of temporal entanglement, demonstrating a strong correlation between a policy's success rate and the ability of its latent space to capture task-progression cues. Based on these insights, we propose a simple, yet effective disentanglement baseline designed to mitigate temporal entanglement. Our empirical results show that traditional methods aimed at enriching features with temporal components are insufficient on their own, highlighting the necessity of explicitly addressing temporal disentanglement for robust visuomotor policy learning.

Abstract: Understanding the advantages of deep neural networks trained by gradient descent (GD) compared to shallow models remains an open theoretical challenge. In this paper, we introduce a class of target functions (single and multi-index Gaussian hierarchical targets) that incorporate a hierarchy of latent subspace dimensionalities. This framework enables us to analytically study the learning dynamics and generalization performance of deep networks compared to shallow ones in the high-dimensional limit. Specifically, our main theorem shows that feature learning with GD successively reduces the effective dimensionality, transforming a high-dimensional problem into a sequence of lower-dimensional ones. This enables learning the target function with drastically less samples than with shallow networks. While the results are proven in a controlled training setting, we also discuss more common training procedures and argue that they learn through the same mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent advances in dance generation have enabled the automatic synthesis of 3D dance motions. However, existing methods still face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving high realism, precise dance-music synchronization, diverse motion expression, and physical plausibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages a generative masked text-to-motion model as a distribution prior to learn a probabilistic mapping from diverse guidance signals, including music, genre, and pose, into high-quality dance motion sequences. Our framework also supports semantic motion editing, such as motion inpainting and body part modification. Specifically, we introduce a multi-tower masked motion model that integrates a text-conditioned masked motion backbone with two parallel, modality-specific branches: a music-guidance tower and a pose-guidance tower. The model is trained using synchronized and progressive masked training, which allows effective infusion of the pretrained text-to-motion prior into the dance synthesis process while enabling each guidance branch to optimize independently through its own loss function, mitigating gradient interference. During inference, we introduce classifier-free logits guidance and pose-guided token optimization to strengthen the influence of music, genre, and pose signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state of the art in dance generation, significantly advancing both the quality and editability over existing approaches.

Abstract: We propose an innovative design for an optical Echo State Network (ESN), an advanced type of reservoir computer known for its universal computational capabilities. Our design enables an optical implementation of arbitrary ESNs, featuring flexibility in optical matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation. Leveraging the nonlinear characteristics of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), the architecture efficiently realizes measurement-free nonlinear activation. The approach significantly reduces computational overhead and energy consumption compared to traditional software-based methods. Comprehensive simulations validate the system's memory capacity, nonlinear processing strength, and polynomial algebra capabilities, showcasing performance comparable to software ESNs across key benchmark tasks. Our design establishes a feasible, scalable, and universally applicable framework for optical reservoir computing, suitable for diverse machine learning applications.

arXiv:2504.08484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an interpolation-based framework for noisy linear systems with unknown system matrix with bounded norm (implying bounded growth or non-increasing energy), and bounded process noise energy. The proposed approach characterizes all trajectories consistent with the measured data and these prior bounds in a purely data-driven manner. This characterization enables data-consistency verification, inference, and one-step ahead prediction, which can be leveraged for safety verification and cost minimization. Ultimately, this work represents a preliminary step toward exploiting interpolation conditions in data-driven control, offering a systematic way to characterize trajectories consistent with a dynamical system within a given class and enabling their use in control design.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. With the introduction of two novel metrics, qubit utilization efficiency and quantum model training strategy, we present a thorough analysis of the current status of the QFL research. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of QC on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.

Abstract: We present evidence from a field experiment across 66 firms and 7,137 knowledge workers. Workers were randomly selected to access a generative AI tool integrated into applications they already used at work for email, meetings, and writing. In the second half of the 6-month experiment, the 80% of treated workers who used this tool spent two fewer hours on email each week and reduced their time working outside of regular hours. Apart from these individual time savings, we do not detect shifts in the quantity or composition of workers' tasks resulting from individual-level AI provision.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can internalize new information and accurately internalize their implications to perform downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the information (news) is explicitly given as context, adequately integrating the information into model weights via fine-tuning remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce New News, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. First, we demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications, and Self-QA -- designed to distill the knowledge processed by the model with context into the weights of the model, which we term System-2 Fine-tuning (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the Self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news while preserving general capabilities. Furthermore, we discover the contextual shadowing effect, where training with the news in context followed by its rephrases or QAs catastrophically degrades learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

arXiv:2505.12528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of algorithms for detecting and estimating a rank-one signal from a noisy observation under prior information about that signal's direction, focusing on examples where the signal is known to have entries biased to be positive. Given a matrix observation $\mathbf{Y}$, our algorithms construct a nonlinear Laplacian, another matrix of the form $\mathbf{Y}+\mathrm{diag}(\sigma(\mathbf{Y1}))$ for a nonlinear $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, and examine the top eigenvalue and eigenvector of this matrix. When $\mathbf{Y}$ is the (suitably normalized) adjacency matrix of a graph, our approach gives a class of algorithms that search for unusually dense subgraphs by computing a spectrum of the graph "deformed" by the degree profile $\mathbf{Y1}$. We study the performance of such algorithms compared to direct spectral algorithms (the case $\sigma=0$) on models of sparse principal component analysis with biased signals, including the Gaussian planted submatrix problem. For such models, we rigorously characterize the strength of rank-one signal, as a function of $\sigma$, required for an outlier eigenvalue to appear in the spectrum of a nonlinear Laplacian matrix. While identifying the $\sigma$ that minimizes the required signal strength in closed form seems intractable, we explore three approaches to design $\sigma$ numerically: exhaustively searching over simple classes of $\sigma$, learning $\sigma$ from datasets of problem instances, and tuning $\sigma$ using black-box optimization of the critical signal strength. We find both theoretically and empirically that, if $\sigma$ is chosen appropriately, then nonlinear Laplacian spectral algorithms substantially outperform direct spectral algorithms, while retaining the conceptual simplicity of spectral methods compared to broader classes of computations like approximate message passing or general first order methods.

arXiv:2505.16270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals, analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense, arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and transferability. Our code is released at https://github.com/jiaruzouu/TransformerCopilot.

arXiv:2505.16927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations, it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes that guide model reasoning toward human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering. Specifically, we employ a form of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The gains that our method achieves highlight the potential of automated, principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

arXiv:2506.04867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents through the generation of control policies that directly map continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. At the outset, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. The approach proves effective with relatively compact models such as GPT-oss:120b and Qwen2.5:72b. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

<title>Self-supervised Learning of Echocardiographic Video Representations via Online Cluster Distillation</title>

arXiv:2506.11777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography (heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder, enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained semantic understanding.Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in zero-shot and linear probing setups,achieving superior segmentation transfer and strong downstream performance on clinically relevant tasks such as LVEF prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring packet-level communication quality is vital for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) in large-scale industrial wireless networks. We enhance the Local Deadline Partition (LDP) algorithm by introducing a CNN-based dynamic priority prediction mechanism for improved interference coordination in multi-cell, multi-channel networks. Unlike LDP's static priorities, our approach uses a Convolutional Neural Network and graph coloring to adaptively assign link priorities based on real-time traffic, transmission opportunities, and network conditions. Assuming that first training phase is performed offline, our approach introduced minimal overhead, while enabling more efficient resource allocation, boosting network capacity, SINR, and schedulability. Simulation results show SINR gains of up to 113\%, 94\%, and 49\% over LDP across three network configurations, highlighting its effectiveness for complex URLLC scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in our project website: https://cumulo-autumn.github.io/StreamDiT/

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

arXiv:2508.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician (\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit, reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone.

<title>Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data</title>

arXiv:2508.15793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including texts, tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks. Yet it remains unclear whether such biases are systematic, which data-level factors drive them, and what internal mechanisms underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of format bias in LLMs through a three-stage empirical analysis. The first stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. The second stage examines how key data-level factors influence these biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its effectiveness. Our results show that format bias is consistent across model families, driven by information richness, structure quality, and representation type, and is closely associated with attention imbalance within the LLMs. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research directions to reduce format bias: enhancing data pre-processing through format repair and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora. These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous data processing systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

Experiments show this test detects violations with sample sizes that are orders of magnitude smaller than existing methods, reducing this number from 50K to a few hundred examples, across diverse realistic mechanisms. Notably, it identifies DP-SGD privacy violations in \textit{under} one training run, unlike prior methods needing full model training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at captioning, visual question answering, and robotics by combining vision and language, yet they often miss obvious objects or hallucinate nonexistent ones in atypical scenes. We examine these failures through the lens of uncertainty, focusing on contextual incongruity, where objects appear unexpectedly or fail to appear in expected contexts, and show that such cases increase recognition difficulty for state-of-the-art LVLMs. To study this regime, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context (ORIC) framework, which constructs incongruous object-context pairs through two complementary strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling to identify hard-to-recognize objects present in the image and (2) CLIP-guided sampling to mine plausible but absent ones. Applied to MSCOCO, ORIC produces ORIC-Bench and ORIC-style training data. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and 2 open-vocabulary detectors reveals substantial performance drops and bias patterns under incongruous contexts. Fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct with Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning on 600 ORIC-style samples improves results on ORIC-Bench, AMBER, and HallusionBench. Overall, we show that contextual incongruity is a key source of uncertainty and provide tools for more reliable LVLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoyangLi-1/ORIC.

<title>Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs</title>

arXiv:2509.20379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs. One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations. To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs. Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug, improves readability, implements a feature).
  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.
  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8 incorrect judgments made by the agent.

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects. BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect, developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of 24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers. Code is available in https://github.com/Jak57/BanglaTalk

Abstract: In this work, we propose a data augmentation strategy aimed at improving the training phase of neural networks and, consequently, the accuracy of their predictions. Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty. The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system, making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical simulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region (Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Although speech emotion recognition (SER) research has been advanced, thanks to deep learning methods, it still suffers from obtaining inputs from large quality-labelled training data. Data augmentation methods have been attempted to mitigate this issue, generative models have shown success among them recently. We propose a data augmentation framework that is aided by cross-modal information transfer and mutual information regularization. Mutual information based metric can serve as an indicator for the quality. Furthermore, we expand this data augmentation scope to multimodal inputs, thanks to mutual information ensureing dependency between modalities. Our framework was tested on three benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV and MSP-Podcast. The implementation was designed to generate input features that are fed into last layer for emotion classification. Our framework improved the performance of emotion prediction against existing works. Also, we discovered that our framework is able to generate new inputs without any cross-modal information.

<title>A filtering scheme for confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE)-video sequences for self-supervised learning</title>

Abstract: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging modality that can be used for in-situ, in-vivo imaging and the microstructural analysis of mucous structures. The diagnosis using CLE is, however, complicated by images being hard to interpret for non-experienced physicians. Utilizing machine learning as an augmentative tool would hence be beneficial, but is complicated by the shortage of histopathology-correlated CLE imaging sequences with respect to the plurality of patterns in this domain, leading to overfitting of machine learning models. To overcome this, self-supervised learning (SSL) can be employed on larger unlabeled datasets. CLE is a video-based modality with high inter-frame correlation, leading to a non-stratified data distribution for SSL training. In this work, we propose a filter functionality on CLE video sequences to reduce the dataset redundancy in SSL training and improve SSL training convergence and training efficiency. We use four state-of-the-art baseline networks and a SSL teacher-student network with a vision transformer small backbone for the evaluation. These networks were evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test accuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both considerably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL is an effective method for CLE pretraining. Further, we show that our proposed CLE video filter can be utilized to improve training efficiency in self-supervised scenarios, resulting in a reduction of 67% in training time.

Abstract: Software aging is a phenomenon that affects long-running systems, leading to progressive performance degradation and increasing the risk of failures. To mitigate this problem, this work proposes an adaptive approach based on machine learning for software aging detection in environments subject to dynamic workload conditions. We evaluate and compare a static model with adaptive models that incorporate adaptive detectors, specifically the Drift Detection Method (DDM) and Adaptive Windowing (ADWIN), originally developed for concept drift scenarios and applied in this work to handle workload shifts. Experiments with simulated sudden, gradual, and recurring workload transitions show that static models suffer a notable performance drop when applied to unseen workload profiles, whereas the adaptive model with ADWIN maintains high accuracy, achieving an F1-Score above 0.93 in all analyzed scenarios.

Abstract: The global waste crisis is escalating, with solid waste generation expected to increase tremendously in the coming years. Traditional waste collection methods, particularly in remote or harsh environments like deserts, are labor-intensive, inefficient, and often hazardous. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have opened the door to automated waste detection systems, yet most research focuses on urban environments and recyclable materials, overlooking organic and hazardous waste and underexplored terrains such as deserts. In this work, we propose YOLO-SAT, an enhanced real-time object detection framework based on a pruned, lightweight version of YOLOv12 integrated with Self-Adversarial Training (SAT) and specialized data augmentation strategies. Using the DroneTrashNet dataset, we demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable for deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking YOLO-SAT against state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its optimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the effectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for robust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.

Abstract: A person's gaze offers valuable insights into their focus of attention, level of social engagement, and confidence. In this work, we investigate how contextual cues combined with visual scene and facial information can be effectively utilized to predict and interpret social gaze patterns during conversational interactions. We introduce CSGaze, a context aware multimodal approach that leverages facial, scene information as complementary inputs to enhance social gaze pattern prediction from multi-person images. The model also incorporates a fine-grained attention mechanism centered on the principal speaker, which helps in better modeling social gaze dynamics. Experimental results show that CSGaze performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods on GP-Static, UCO-LAEO and AVA-LAEO. Our findings highlight the role of contextual cues in improving social gaze prediction. Additionally, we provide initial explainability through generated attention scores, offering insights into the model's decision-making process. We also demonstrate our model's generalizability by testing our model on open set datasets that demonstrating its robustness across diverse scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Markovian Thinking, Delethink, Long Chains of Thought, Efficient Reasoning<br /><br />Summary: This work addresses the computational inefficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for training large language models (LLMs) to perform long chains of thought (LongCoT) reasoning. Traditional RL environments treat the state as the prompt plus all prior tokens, leading to unbounded state size and quadratic compute costs with increasing reasoning length. The authors introduce Markovian Thinking, a new paradigm where the policy conditions on a fixed-size state, decoupling reasoning length from context size and enabling linear compute with constant memory usage. They implement this concept in Delethink, an RL environment that segments reasoning into fixed-size chunks, resetting context boundaries and carrying over a concise textual state to allow seamless continuation of thought. A 1.5B parameter R1-Distill model trained with Delethink can reason over 8K-token chunks while effectively thinking up to 24K tokens, matching or outperforming existing LongCoT-RL models with larger budget requirements. At scale, Delethink continues to improve beyond lengths where LongCoT plateaus. The linear compute advantage significantly reduces training costs, exemplified by a comparison showing Delethink requires 7 H100-months versus 27 for LongCoT-RL at an estimated 96K token reasoning length. Initial analysis shows many off-the-shelf reasoning models sample Markovian traces zero-shot, aiding effective RL training. Overall, redesigning the reasoning environment enables much longer, more efficient, and scalable reasoning in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget. With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus. The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink. Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B) often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient, scalable reasoning LLMs.

<div> Keywords: spiked Wigner matrices, correlated signals, detection algorithm, computational threshold, low-degree polynomial method<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. This paper investigates the problem of detecting and estimating correlated signals embedded in two spiked Wigner matrices, a fundamental model in high-dimensional statistics.<br /><br />2. The observations follow the model \( X = \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xx^{\top} + W \) and \( Y = \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yy^{\top} + Z \), where \(x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n\) are signal vectors exhibiting correlation \( \rho \), and \( W, Z \) are independent Gaussian noise matrices.<br /><br />3. The authors introduce an efficient algorithm that successfully detects and estimates the correlated signals whenever the function \( F(\lambda, \mu, \rho) > 1 \), where \( F \) measures a combination of signal strengths and correlation.<br /><br />4. A key insight is that leveraging the correlation \( \rho \) enables signal recovery in parameter regimes where recovery from each matrix individually is computationally infeasible.<br /><br />5. Complementing their algorithmic upper bound, the authors provide evidence of a matching computational lower bound by showing that all low-degree polynomial algorithms fail when \( F(\lambda, \mu, \rho) < 1 \), suggesting that the threshold \( F=1 \) marks a sharp computational phase transition.<br /><br />Overall, the work characterizes the precise limits of efficient detection and estimation of correlated signals in spiked Wigner matrices and establishes a strong connection between algorithmic performance and computational hardness indicators. <div>

Abstract: We study the computational task of detecting and estimating correlated signals in a pair of spiked Wigner matrices. Our model consists of observations
  $$
  X = \tfrac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}} xx^{\top} + W \,, \quad Y = \tfrac{\mu}{\sqrt{n}} yy^{\top} + Z \,.
  $$
  where $x,y \in \mathbb R^n$ are signal vectors with norm $\|x\|,\|y\| \approx\sqrt{n}$ and correlation $\langle x,y \rangle \approx \rho\|x\|\|y\|$, while $W,Z$ are independent Gaussian Wigner matrices. We propose an efficient algorithm that succeeds whenever $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)>1$, where
  $$
  F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=\max\Big\{ \lambda,\mu, \frac{ \lambda^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\lambda^2+\lambda^2 \rho^2 } + \frac{ \mu^2 \rho^2 }{ 1-\mu^2+\mu^2 \rho^2 } \Big\} \,.
  $$
  Our result shows that an algorithm can leverage the correlation between the spikes to detect and estimate the signals even in regimes where efficiently recovering either $x$ from $X$ alone or $y$ from $Y$ alone is believed to be computationally infeasible.
  We complement our algorithmic result with evidence for a matching computational lower bound. In particular, we prove that when $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)<1$, all algorithms based on {\em low-degree polynomials} fails to distinguish $(X,Y)$ with two independent Wigner matrices. This low-degree analysis strongly suggests that $F(\lambda,\mu,\rho)=1$ is the precise computation threshold for this problem.

<div> Low-dose chest CT, cardiopulmonary risk, explainable AI, cross-disease reasoning, cardiovascular prediction<br /><br />Summary: This article presents an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework designed to assess cardiopulmonary risk from a single low-dose chest CT (LDCT) scan. Unlike previous methods that treat pulmonary and cardiac analyses separately, this framework mimics clinical diagnostic reasoning by first detecting lung abnormalities, then applying medical knowledge to infer their cardiovascular implications, and finally encoding cardiac structural biomarkers. The system consists of three interconnected modules: a pulmonary perception module that identifies lung findings, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that links these findings to cardiovascular risk, and a cardiac representation module that encodes heart-related markers. Their combined output results in an accurate and physiologically interpretable cardiovascular risk prediction. Evaluated on the NLST cohort, the framework outperforms traditional single-disease and image-based approaches in cardiovascular disease screening and mortality prediction. Importantly, it provides explanations consistent with cardiological understanding, illustrating meaningful connections between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. This unified and interpretable approach bridges the gap between image-driven prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation, offering a novel pathway for integrated cardiopulmonary health assessment from routine LDCT scans. <div>

Abstract: Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation.

<div> Keywords: Automated ICD coding, long-tail distribution, co-occurrence encoding, directed bipartite graph encoder, large language model  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenge of automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding, a multi-label classification task with a very large label set and significant long-tail distribution issues. To improve predictions for rare codes, the authors propose a novel Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder that separates common and rare code nodes, allowing one-way directed edges from common to rare codes. The edges incorporate a probability-based bias derived from the conditional probability of common code co-occurrence given rare codes, which is integrated into the attention module as Co-occurrence Encoding. This method enriches rare code embeddings by aggregating latent comorbidity information from common codes. Moreover, initial code embeddings are enhanced using comprehensive descriptions generated by a large language model (LLM), which provides clinical context and external knowledge about comorbidity relationships. Experimental results on three benchmark automated ICD coding datasets demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly improving Macro-F1 scores, highlighting its effectiveness in handling the long-tail distribution problem in ICD coding. <div>
arXiv:2511.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding aims to assign multiple disease codes to clinical documents, constituting a crucial multi-label text classification task in healthcare informatics. However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.

<title>Let the Experts Speak: Improving Survival Prediction &amp; Calibration via Mixture-of-Experts Heads</title>

<div> mixture-of-experts, survival analysis, patient clustering, calibration, predictive accuracy<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of balancing patient clustering with calibration and predictive accuracy in survival analysis using deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Traditional MoE approaches cluster patients but often sacrifice calibration error and prediction precision because predictions for individuals are forced to align closely with their assigned group. The authors propose several discrete-time deep MoE architectures that aim to simultaneously achieve patient clustering, improved calibration, and better predictive accuracy. A key finding is that the expressiveness of the individual experts within the MoE framework significantly influences performance. Specifically, experts that make tailored predictions for each patient outperform those relying on fixed group prototypes. This suggests that allowing experts more flexibility to adapt to individual patient data rather than strictly enforcing group-level predictions leads to better overall outcomes. The study demonstrates the viability of discovering meaningful patient group structures without compromising on key performance metrics, advancing methods for personalized survival prognosis. <div>
arXiv:2511.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep mixture-of-experts models have attracted a lot of attention for survival analysis problems, particularly for their ability to cluster similar patients together. In practice, grouping often comes at the expense of key metrics such calibration error and predictive accuracy. This is due to the restrictive inductive bias that mixture-of-experts imposes, that predictions for individual patients must look like predictions for the group they're assigned to. Might we be able to discover patient group structure, where it exists, while improving calibration and predictive accuracy? In this work, we introduce several discrete-time deep mixture-of-experts (MoE) based architectures for survival analysis problems, one of which achieves all desiderata: clustering, calibration, and predictive accuracy. We show that a key differentiator between this array of MoEs is how expressive their experts are. We find that more expressive experts that tailor predictions per patient outperform experts that rely on fixed group prototypes.

<div> Jump Markov Filtering, Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks, KalmanNet, State Estimation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework designed for real-time state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. The proposed architecture integrates two recurrent neural networks (RNNs): one dedicated to mode prediction and another for filtering, which builds upon a mode-augmented version of the KalmanNet framework. These RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy, enabling them to adapt mutually without requiring supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate JMFNet’s superior performance over classical model-based filters, such as interacting multiple models and particle filters, as well as model-free deep learning methods, especially in scenarios characterized by non-stationarity and high noise levels. The framework is tested on both linear and nonlinear systems, including applications like target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and real-life datasets. JMFNet also produces small yet meaningful improvements over KalmanNet, which become more significant in complex systems or long trajectories. Finally, empirical evaluations confirm that JMFNet is consistent and reliable, showing robustness against variations in initial conditions, hyperparameter choices, and inaccuracies in model knowledge. <div>

It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: group averaging, equivariance, machine learning, symmetries, differential equations<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Many machine learning tasks in natural sciences require models that are exactly equivariant to certain symmetries, but equivariant methods are underused due to training challenges, expectations that symmetries will be learned automatically, or implementation difficulties.<br /><br />2. Group averaging is a method applied at test time that can enforce exact equivariance on any pre-trained model without changing its structure or training process, by averaging predictions over a symmetry group.<br /><br />3. This technique incurs a computational cost proportional to the size of the symmetry group, which is often small, making it an inexpensive way to improve model predictions.<br /><br />4.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks in the natural sciences are precisely equivariant to particular symmetries. Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics. This short paper shows that, under certain common circumstances, there are no disadvantages to imposing exact symmetries; the ML4PS community should consider group averaging as a cheap and simple way to improve model accuracy.

<div> Keywords: denoising diffusion probabilistic model, heat sink design, surrogate gradients, multi-fidelity training, pressure drop optimization

<br /><br />Summary:  
This study introduces a generative optimization framework utilizing a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to design heat sinks that minimize pressure drop while keeping surface temperatures below a set threshold. It represents geometries through boundary representations of multiple fins and employs a multi-fidelity approach to assemble training data, enabling efficient learning across different simulation accuracies. Two residual neural networks are trained to predict pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry, and gradients from these surrogate models guide the generative process toward designs satisfying thermal and fluid flow constraints. Unlike traditional black-box optimization methods such as CMA-ES, this approach uses surrogate gradients for inference-time guidance, enhancing scalability as more training data is provided. Additionally, the method contrasts with traditional topology optimization, offering low computational cost during inference without retraining when new constraints arise. The results show that generated heat sink designs achieve up to 10% lower pressure drops than those found by conventional optimization techniques, while reliably maintaining temperature limits. This work advances the field by providing a scalable, generative approach capable of producing efficient electronics cooling designs, marking progress toward foundational models for complex heat exchanger systems. <div>

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework based on a guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that leverages surrogate gradients to generate heat sink designs minimizing pressure drop while maintaining surface temperatures below a specified threshold. Geometries are represented using boundary representations of multiple fins, and a multi-fidelity approach is employed to generate training data. Using this dataset, along with vectors representing the boundary representation geometries, we train a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate heat sinks with characteristics consistent with those observed in the data. We train two different residual neural networks to predict the pressure drop and surface temperature for each geometry. We use the gradients of these surrogate models with respect to the design variables to guide the geometry generation process toward satisfying the low-pressure and surface temperature constraints. This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods. This work represents a step toward building a foundational generative model for electronics cooling.

<title>Scaling Environments for LLM Agents in the Era of Learning from Interaction: A Survey</title>

<div> Keywords: LLM-based agents, reinforcement learning, Generation-Execution-Feedback loop, environment scaling, experiential data<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the limitations of training large language model (LLM)-based agents solely on static, human-generated datasets for complex tasks. It highlights that such datasets are expensive to create and lack real-time adaptability and realism needed for advanced capabilities like adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a reinforcement learning framework where agents interact dynamically with environments and learn from experience. They introduce the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, a formalization describing an iterative process where environments generate tasks, observe agent actions during execution, and provide evaluative feedback based on rollouts to drive learning. Emphasizing the critical role environments play as producers of experiential data, the paper surveys state-of-the-art methods for environment scaling, focusing on increasing complexity, realism, and interactivity. The survey organizes these methods along the three stages of the GEF loop: task generation, task execution, and feedback, providing a structured perspective on environment-centric approaches. Additionally, the authors analyze benchmarks, implementation techniques, and practical applications, consolidating fragmented research efforts and outlining future directions to advance autonomous agent intelligence through richer environment interaction. <div>

Abstract: LLM-based agents can autonomously accomplish complex tasks across various domains. However, to further cultivate capabilities such as adaptive behavior and long-term decision-making, training on static datasets built from human-level knowledge is insufficient. These datasets are costly to construct and lack both dynamism and realism. A growing consensus is that agents should instead interact directly with environments and learn from experience through reinforcement learning. We formalize this iterative process as the Generation-Execution-Feedback (GEF) loop, where environments generate tasks to challenge agents, return observations in response to agents' actions during task execution, and provide evaluative feedback on rollouts for subsequent learning. Under this paradigm, environments function as indispensable producers of experiential data, highlighting the need to scale them toward greater complexity, realism, and interactivity. In this survey, we systematically review representative methods for environment scaling from a pioneering environment-centric perspective and organize them along the stages of the GEF loop, namely task generation, task execution, and feedback. We further analyze benchmarks, implementation strategies, and applications, consolidating fragmented advances and outlining future research directions for agent intelligence.

<div> Keywords: Graph Neural Networks, RTL circuits, dynamic behavior, Control Data Flow Graph, circuit representation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel Graph Neural Network model designed to capture both static and dynamic aspects of Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuit representations. Unlike prior GNN models that focus only on static structural characteristics, DR-GNN incorporates multi-cycle execution behaviors by leveraging an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG). This approach enables the model to effectively represent dynamic dependencies and runtime execution flows of circuits, which are critical for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To facilitate model training and evaluation, the authors have created the first large-scale dynamic circuit dataset containing over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Experimental results reveal that DR-GNN significantly outperforms existing models on tasks such as branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Additionally, the learned representations demonstrate strong transfer learning capabilities, showing improved performance on related dynamic circuit analysis tasks including power estimation and assertion prediction. Overall, this work marks an important step in bridging the gap between static and dynamic circuit analysis by integrating runtime information into graph-based circuit representation learning. <div>

Abstract: There is a growing body of work on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn representations of circuits, focusing primarily on their static characteristics. However, these models fail to capture circuit runtime behavior, which is crucial for tasks like circuit verification and optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce DR-GNN (DynamicRTL-GNN), a novel approach that learns RTL circuit representations by incorporating both static structures and multi-cycle execution behaviors. DR-GNN leverages an operator-level Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to represent Register Transfer Level (RTL) circuits, enabling the model to capture dynamic dependencies and runtime execution. To train and evaluate DR-GNN, we build the first comprehensive dynamic circuit dataset, comprising over 6,300 Verilog designs and 63,000 simulation traces. Our results demonstrate that DR-GNN outperforms existing models in branch hit prediction and toggle rate prediction. Furthermore, its learned representations transfer effectively to related dynamic circuit tasks, achieving strong performance in power estimation and assertion prediction.

<title>Making Every Head Count: Sparse Attention Without the Speed-Performance Trade-off</title>

<div> Efficiency, Large Language Models, Multi-head attention, Structural sparsity, Sparse attention methods<br /><br />Summary: The article addresses the computational inefficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs) stemming from the multi-head attention mechanism, whose complexity scales as \(O(H \cdot N^2)\), where \(H\) is the number of heads and \(N\) the context size. The standard approach results in redundant computations as each head processes the entire sequence independently. Existing sparse attention methods improve efficiency but often at the cost of losing performance integrity. To resolve this, the authors introduce SPAttention, which implements a novel concept called Principled Structural Sparsity. Instead of dropping connections arbitrarily, SPAttention partitions the attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment to focus on. This reorganization transforms \(H\) independent \(O(N^2)\) computations into a single collaborative \(O(N^2)\) computation, effectively reducing complexity by a factor of \(H\). This structured inductive bias encourages functional specialization among heads, improving computational resource allocation and modeling distinct dependencies across the sequence. Empirical evaluations on various OLMoE models demonstrate that SPAttention nearly doubles training throughput while matching or exceeding the performance of dense attention. It also consistently outperforms leading sparse methods such as Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all tested metrics. <div>
arXiv:2511.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of Large Language Models (LLMs) has long been hampered by a fundamental conflict within their core attention mechanism: its remarkable expressivity is built upon a computational complexity of $O(H \cdot N^2)$ that grows quadratically with the context size ($N$) and linearly with the number of heads ($H$). This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.

<div> Keywords: parametric multi-objective optimization, Bayesian optimization, inverse model, task-aware Gaussian processes, conditional generative models  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenge of solving parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs), where a continuous set of task parameters leads to infinitely many distinct optimization problems, each typically requiring costly evaluations. To overcome this, the authors propose the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer designed to learn an inverse model that can predict optimized solutions directly for any given task-preference query, eliminating the need for additional expensive re-evaluations. The proposed method alternates between two key processes: (1) acquisition-driven search that leverages synergies among related tasks by using task-aware Gaussian processes, enabling faster convergence and efficient exploration across tasks, and (2) generative solution sampling powered by conditional generative models, which provides diverse candidate solutions representative of the task space. This alternating framework exploits inter-task relationships to improve optimization effectiveness and efficiency. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify the accelerated convergence achieved by incorporating task awareness. Extensive empirical experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world problems demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach, validating its ability to efficiently optimize across related tasks and predict solutions for unseen parameterized optimization problems without new expensive function evaluations. <div>
arXiv:2511.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world applications require solving families of expensive multi-objective optimization problems~(EMOPs) under varying operational conditions. This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes. Meanwhile, empirical studies in synthetic and real-world benchmarks further verify the effectiveness of our alternating framework.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Quantile Optimization, UCB-QRL, Finite-Horizon MDPs, Regret Bound  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the limitation in classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) which traditionally optimizes expected rewards but neglects risk sensitivity, a crucial factor in domains like healthcare and finance. To incorporate risk sensitivity, the authors focus on optimizing a specific quantile (the $\tau$-quantile) of the cumulative reward distribution rather than the mean. They propose a novel algorithm called UCB-QRL, designed for finite-horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which operates optimistically by maintaining confidence intervals around the estimated transition probabilities. At each iteration, UCB-QRL updates its estimate of the transition dynamics and then optimizes the quantile value function over a confidence set surrounding this estimate. The paper provides theoretical guarantees by deriving a high-probability regret bound for UCB-QRL in the episodic RL setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and horizon length $H$. The regret bound scales as $\mathcal O\left((2/\kappa)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/\delta)}\right)$, where $\kappa$ is a positive constant representing the sensitivity of the quantile value function of the MDP. This work thus advances RL by rigorously integrating risk-sensitive objectives, providing both methodology and theoretical analysis. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, the classical foundations of RL do not account for the risk sensitivity of the objective function, which is critical in various fields, including healthcare and finance. A popular approach to incorporate risk sensitivity is to optimize a specific quantile of the cumulative reward distribution. In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $\tau$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). UCB-QRL is an iterative algorithm in which, at each iteration, we first estimate the underlying transition probability and then optimize the quantile value function over a confidence ball around this estimate. We show that UCB-QRL yields a high-probability regret bound $\mathcal O\left((2/\kappa)^{H+1}H\sqrt{SATH\log(2SATH/\delta)}\right)$ in the episodic setting with $S$ states, $A$ actions, $T$ episodes, and $H$ horizons. Here, $\kappa>0$ is a problem-dependent constant that captures the sensitivity of the underlying MDP's quantile value.

<div> Keywords: deep tabular modelling, in-context learning, self-supervised pre-training, Tabular Foundation Model, transfer learning<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The article investigates deep tabular modelling using in-context learning, where a model predicts labels from given $(x,y)$ pairs without weight updates during inference.  
2. It challenges the common belief that successful generalization requires extensive pre-training on large synthetic datasets (like TabPFN) or vast real datasets (like TabDPT).  
3. The authors find that effective generalization can be achieved with surprisingly little data, specifically through self-supervised pre-training on just a single real table.  
4. By systematically pre-training and evaluating across various diverse datasets, they analyze which data characteristics are crucial for building a robust Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) capable of transfer across different domains.  
5. They reveal that the key factor influencing downstream performance is the number and quality of distinct tasks that can be constructed from the dataset, highlighting the importance of task diversity in the pre-training phase shared by most TFMs. <div>
arXiv:2511.09665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep tabular modelling increasingly relies on in-context learning where, during inference, a model receives a set of $(x,y)$ pairs as context and predicts labels for new inputs without weight updates. We challenge the prevailing view that broad generalization here requires pre-training on large synthetic corpora (e.g., TabPFN priors) or a large collection of real data (e.g., TabDPT training datasets), discovering that a relatively small amount of data suffices for generalization. We find that simple self-supervised pre-training on just a \emph{single} real table can produce surprisingly strong transfer across heterogeneous benchmarks. By systematically pre-training and evaluating on many diverse datasets, we analyze what aspects of the data are most important for building a Tabular Foundation Model (TFM) generalizing across domains. We then connect this to the pre-training procedure shared by most TFMs and show that the number and quality of \emph{tasks} one can construct from a dataset is key to downstream performance.

<div> Differential Privacy, Synthetic Data, Graphical Models, Neural Networks, Scalability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges in generating differentially private synthetic tabular data by improving existing frameworks. It highlights that current state-of-the-art methods, such as AIM, utilize an adaptive 'select-measure-generate' approach that iteratively measures low-order noisy marginals and fits graphical models, but these models become inefficient for high-dimensional data due to memory constraints and retraining overhead. The authors note that newer methods like GEM replace graphical models with generator neural networks to enhance scalability, though prior evaluations have been limited to small datasets. To overcome these limitations, the paper introduces GEM+, which combines AIM’s adaptive measurement strategy with GEM’s scalable neural network generator. Experimental results demonstrate that GEM+ surpasses AIM in both data utility and computational scalability. Importantly, GEM+ is able to handle datasets with over a hundred columns effectively, where AIM struggles with memory usage and computational demands. The study thus advances the practical applicability of differentially private synthetic data generation to larger, more complex real-world datasets by integrating adaptive measurement with scalable neural network synthesis. <div>

Abstract: State-of-the-art differentially private synthetic tabular data has been defined by adaptive 'select-measure-generate' frameworks, exemplified by methods like AIM. These approaches iteratively measure low-order noisy marginals and fit graphical models to produce synthetic data, enabling systematic optimisation of data quality under privacy constraints. Graphical models, however, are inefficient for high-dimensional data because they require substantial memory and must be retrained from scratch whenever the graph structure changes, leading to significant computational overhead. Recent methods, like GEM, overcome these limitations by using generator neural networks for improved scalability. However, empirical comparisons have mostly focused on small datasets, limiting real-world applicability. In this work, we introduce GEM+, which integrates AIM's adaptive measurement framework with GEM's scalable generator network. Our experiments show that GEM+ outperforms AIM in both utility and scalability, delivering state-of-the-art results while efficiently handling datasets with over a hundred columns, where AIM fails due to memory and computational overheads.

<div> Generative Flow Networks, Boosted GFlowNets, exploration, sample diversity, trajectory-balance<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are effective samplers designed to generate compositional objects proportionally to a given non-negative reward. However, standard GFlowNets often struggle with uneven exploration of the reward landscape, where trajectories leading to easily reachable regions dominate training, causing poor coverage of high-reward but hard-to-reach modes. To address this issue, the paper introduces Boosted GFlowNets, a novel method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets. Each subsequent model in the ensemble optimizes a residual reward that accounts for the reward mass already captured by previous models, thereby reactivating learning signals in underexplored areas. This residual approach ensures a monotone non-degradation property under mild assumptions, meaning that adding booster models cannot worsen the learned distribution and generally improves it. Empirical results demonstrate that Boosted GFlowNets achieve significantly better exploration and greater sample diversity on challenging multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks. Importantly, this method maintains the stability and simplicity characteristic of standard trajectory-balance training, making it an efficient and effective enhancement for GFlowNets in sampling complex distributions. <div>
arXiv:2511.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful samplers for compositional objects that, by design, sample proportionally to a given non-negative reward. Nonetheless, in practice, they often struggle to explore the reward landscape evenly: trajectories toward easy-to-reach regions dominate training, while hard-to-reach modes receive vanishing or uninformative gradients, leading to poor coverage of high-reward areas. We address this imbalance with Boosted GFlowNets, a method that sequentially trains an ensemble of GFlowNets, each optimizing a residual reward that compensates for the mass already captured by previous models. This residual principle reactivates learning signals in underexplored regions and, under mild assumptions, ensures a monotone non-degradation property: adding boosters cannot worsen the learned distribution and typically improves it. Empirically, Boosted GFlowNets achieve substantially better exploration and sample diversity on multimodal synthetic benchmarks and peptide design tasks, while preserving the stability and simplicity of standard trajectory-balance training.

<div> Sample-efficient, Black-box attack, Visual reinforcement learning, Shadow Q model, Generative adversarial network<br /><br />Summary: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant advancements in visual control and robotics, yet its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations is not well studied. Existing black-box attacks primarily target vector-based or discrete-action RL, and they struggle with image-based continuous control due to large action spaces and high environment query demands. SEBA is introduced as a novel sample-efficient framework designed for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA incorporates a shadow Q model to estimate cumulative rewards under adversarial scenarios, a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to minimize real environment queries. The framework employs a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between updating the shadow Q model and refining the adversarial perturbation generator. Experimental results on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks demonstrate that SEBA can significantly reduce the cumulative rewards of targeted agents while preserving the visual fidelity of perturbations. Moreover, SEBA achieves this with a substantially lower number of environment interactions compared to previous black-box and white-box attack methods, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in compromising visual RL systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable progress in visual control and robotics, but its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Most existing black-box attacks focus on vector-based or discrete-action RL, and their effectiveness on image-based continuous control is limited by the large action space and excessive environment queries. We propose SEBA, a sample-efficient framework for black-box adversarial attacks on visual RL agents. SEBA integrates a shadow Q model that estimates cumulative rewards under adversarial conditions, a generative adversarial network that produces visually imperceptible perturbations, and a world model that simulates environment dynamics to reduce real-world queries. Through a two-stage iterative training procedure that alternates between learning the shadow model and refining the generator, SEBA achieves strong attack performance while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks show that SEBA significantly reduces cumulative rewards, preserves visual fidelity, and greatly decreases environment interactions compared to prior black-box and white-box methods.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Text2SQL, Reward Function, Constrained RL, Large Language Models<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper focuses on improving the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL). The authors highlight that while advanced RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO have been effective, their performance heavily depends on the design of the reward functions. Poorly designed rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit flaws in the reward system without truly solving the task. To address this, the study introduces a constrained RL framework that integrates natural and interpretable reward signals alongside constraint signals. This approach aims to balance these different signals dynamically during training to prevent reward exploitation. The proposed framework is supported by theoretical guarantees that validate its efficacy. Experiments conducted on well-known Text2SQL datasets demonstrate that this method outperforms state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs, showing significant improvements in task performance. The work emphasizes a more reliable and balanced reward mechanism that enhances model reasoning and robustness in Text2SQL tasks. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Text2SQL LLMs, especially with advanced algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO. However, the performance of these methods is highly sensitive to the design of reward functions. Inappropriate rewards can lead to reward hacking, where models exploit loopholes in the reward structure to achieve high scores without genuinely solving the task. This work considers a constrained RL framework for Text2SQL that incorporates natural and interpretable reward and constraint signals, while dynamically balancing trade-offs among them during the training. We establish the theoretical guarantees of our constrained RL framework and our numerical experiments on the well-known Text2SQL datasets substantiate the improvement of our approach over the state-of-the-art RL-trained LLMs.

<br /><br />Summary:  
The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computational model that encodes information using high-dimensional integer vectors based on modular arithmetic, generalizing the binary spatter code model to improve representational power with lower precision requirements. Despite its potential advantages, MCR has been underexplored, with few systematic analyses or comparisons to other vector representation methods. This work provides the first comprehensive evaluation of MCR, showing it balances capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency uniquely. Experimental results reveal that MCR surpasses binary and integer vector capacities while nearing the performance of complex-valued representations but with significantly less memory requirement. On a broad suite of 123 datasets, MCR consistently improves accuracy and can match binary spatter code performance using up to four times less memory. The study also introduces a tailored hardware accelerator for MCR, leveraging its suitability for digital logic implementation. Evaluation on basic operations and selected datasets reveals speedups up to 1000x and substantial energy savings versus software implementations. When accuracy is equalized to binary spatter codes, MCR demonstrates on average 3.08 times faster execution and 2.68 times lower energy consumption. These results confirm that despite increased operational complexity, MCR’s modular arithmetic and greater per-component precision reduce dimensionality, enabling a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative when paired with dedicated hardware. <div>

Abstract: The modular composite representation (MCR) is a computing model that represents information with high-dimensional integer vectors using modular arithmetic. Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption. These findings demonstrate that, although MCR requires more sophisticated operations than binary spatter codes, its modular arithmetic and higher per-component precision enable lower dimensionality. When realized with dedicated hardware, this results in a faster, more energy-efficient, and high-precision alternative to existing models.

<div> Partial differential equations, deep learning, surrogate models, PDE generalization, equation-aware emulation<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the computational challenges of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by proposing a deep learning framework for equation-aware emulation. Unlike typical surrogate models that are specialized for a single PDE with fixed parameters, the authors introduce a method that generalizes to unseen PDEs by conditioning a neural network on an encoding vector that represents PDE terms and their coefficients. The framework is evaluated on a family of one-dimensional PDEs from the APEBench suite, demonstrating strong performance on parameter sets not encountered during training. Additionally, the model exhibits stability when rolling out predictions beyond the training time horizon. Notably, the approach generalizes well even to entirely unseen PDEs, showcasing its versatility. The work contributes to broader AI-driven efforts aiming to automate the creation of expert-level empirical software for scientific tasks that require scoring or quantitative evaluation. The authors further enhance reproducibility by providing both the data and codebase openly at the linked GitHub repository. This combination of generalization, stability, and open resources marks a significant advancement in surrogate modeling for scientific computing. <div>

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be prohibitively expensive using traditional numerical methods. Deep learning-based surrogate models typically specialize in a single PDE with fixed parameters. We present a framework for equation-aware emulation that generalizes to unseen PDEs, conditioning a neural model on a vector encoding representing the terms in a PDE and their coefficients. We present a baseline of four distinct modeling technqiues, trained on a family of 1D PDEs from the APEBench suite. Our approach achieves strong performance on parameter sets held out from the training distribution, with strong stability for rollout beyond the training window, and generalization to an entirely unseen PDE. This work was developed as part of a broader effort exploring AI systems that automate the creation of expert-level empirical software for scorable scientific tasks.

Abstract: Radar-based precipitation nowcasting, the task of forecasting short-term precipitation fields from previous radar images, is a critical problem for flood risk management and decision-making. While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps. This work positions CFM as a powerful and practical alternative for high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting.

<div> Keywords: Split Federated Learning, catastrophic forgetting, data heterogeneity, multi-head neural networks, Hydra  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses Split Federated Learning (SFL), a collaborative training method where the model is divided into two parts—Part-1 trained locally on clients and Part-2 processed sequentially by a server from client activations.  
2. The study highlights the problem of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL caused by data heterogeneity among clients, where local model updates diverge from global optima and the server’s sequential processing introduces forgetting effects similar to continual learning.  
3. It was observed that the model tends to perform better on classes seen later in the server’s processing sequence, indicating a label bias influenced by the order of data processing.  
4. The authors analyze critical factors in SFL that contribute to forgetting, focusing on how the processing order at the server and the choice of cut layer impact model performance and CF.  
5. To combat this issue, they propose Hydra, a novel mitigation strategy inspired by multi-head neural networks, specifically designed for the SFL environment.  
6. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hydra surpasses existing baselines and competing methods from the literature, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and improving overall model accuracy on heterogeneous data distributions in SFL. <div>
arXiv:2511.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Split Federated Learning (SFL), the clients collaboratively train a model with the help of a server by splitting the model into two parts. Part-1 is trained locally at each client and aggregated by the aggregator at the end of each round. Part-2 is trained at a server that sequentially processes the intermediate activations received from each client. We study the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting (CF) in SFL in the presence of data heterogeneity. In detail, due to the nature of SFL, local updates of part-1 may drift away from global optima, while part-2 is sensitive to the processing sequence, similar to forgetting in continual learning (CL). Specifically, we observe that the trained model performs better in classes (labels) seen at the end of the sequence. We investigate this phenomenon with emphasis on key aspects of SFL, such as the processing order at the server and the cut layer. Based on our findings, we propose Hydra, a novel mitigation method inspired by multi-head neural networks and adapted for the SFL's setting. Extensive numerical evaluations show that Hydra outperforms baselines and methods from the literature.

<div> Generalization, Contextual Reinforcement Learning, Out-of-Distribution, SPARC, Robust Control<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper addresses the challenge of generalizing reinforcement learning agents to unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, a critical issue in robotics and control applications such as self-driving cars and quadrupedal robots.  
2. It focuses on contextual reinforcement learning where agents must operate under varying contexts that differ from training conditions, without having explicit context information available at test time.  
3. Prior approaches commonly rely on a two-phase training strategy involving separate stages for a context encoder and a history adaptation module, which can be complex and cumbersome to implement.  
4. The authors propose SPARC, a novel single-phase adaptation method designed to simplify training and improve robust control by integrating the adaptation process seamlessly into one training phase.  
5. Experiments conducted in high-fidelity simulators, including Gran Turismo 7 for racing scenarios and MuJoCo with wind perturbations, demonstrate that SPARC offers more reliable and robust OOD generalization than existing methods. This work thus advances the practicality and effectiveness of reinforcement learning for real-world robotics tasks requiring adaptation to new, unseen conditions. <div>
arXiv:2511.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalization to unseen environments is a significant challenge in the field of robotics and control. In this work, we focus on contextual reinforcement learning, where agents act within environments with varying contexts, such as self-driving cars or quadrupedal robots that need to operate in different terrains or weather conditions than they were trained for. We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train. We simplify the methodology and introduce SPARC: single-phase adaptation for robust control. We test SPARC on varying contexts within the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo 7 and wind-perturbed MuJoCo environments, and find that it achieves reliable and robust OOD generalization.

<title>TawPipe: Topology-Aware Weight Pipeline Parallelism for Accelerating Long-Context Large Models Training</title>

<div> arXiv, large language models, pipeline parallelism, communication efficiency, distributed clusters  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Training large language models (LLMs) faces challenges due to limited device memory and expensive inter-device communication. Pipeline parallelism partitions the model across devices to reduce memory use, but it incurs high activation communication overhead proportional to sequence length, limiting efficiency for long contexts. Existing weight-passing methods such as WeiPipe reduce activation communication by transmitting weights instead, yet these methods suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. To address these shortcomings, TawPipe is proposed as a topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism technique designed to leverage hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters. TawPipe optimizes communication by grouping devices based on physical topology, enabling efficient intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication. Each device is assigned a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, eliminating redundant transfers common in other approaches. Moreover, communication is overlapped with computation to hide communication latency. Unlike fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) which uses global collective operations, TawPipe mostly confines communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing expensive cross-node traffic. Experiments conducted on up to 24 GPUs running LLaMA-style models demonstrate that TawPipe provides superior throughput and scalability compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising approach for efficient large model training. <div>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by limited device memory and costly inter-device communication. Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic. Extensive experiments on up to 24 GPUs with LLaMA-style models show that TawPipe achieves superior throughput and scalability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<div> Keywords: financial markets, macro-contextual retrieval, out-of-distribution forecasting, multimodal embedding, regime shifts<br /><br />Summary:<br />1. Financial markets exhibit non-stationarity due to structural breaks and macroeconomic regime changes, causing forecasting models to fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.<br />2. Traditional multimodal approaches that combine numerical indicators and textual sentiment lack adaptability to such distributional shifts.<br />3. The authors propose macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds predictions in historically similar macroeconomic regimes by jointly embedding macro indicators and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space.<br />4. This framework enables causal retrieval of precedent macroeconomic periods during inference without retraining.<br />5. Trained on 17 years of S&amp;P 500 data (2007-2023) and tested OOD on AAPL and XOM data from 2024, the approach reduces the gap between cross-validation and OOD performance.<br />6. The macro-conditioned retrieval method is the only approach to yield positive out-of-sample trading results, achieving PF=1.18 and Sharpe=0.95 on AAPL, and PF=1.16 and Sharpe=0.61 on XOM.<br />7. Baseline methods including static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal models fail under regime shifts.<br />8. Retrieved historical neighbors provide interpretable evidence chains corresponding to recognizable macro contexts like inflationary periods or yield-curve inversions, enhancing causal interpretability and transparency.<br />9. This demonstrates that grounding forecasts in macro-aware retrieval can produce robust, explainable predictions under distributional changes.<br />10. The datasets, models, and code from this study are publicly released. <div>
arXiv:2511.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary: structural breaks and macroeconomic regime shifts often cause forecasting models to fail when deployed out of distribution (OOD). Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.
  Trained on seventeen years of S&amp;P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency. By operationalizing the principle that "financial history may not repeat, but it often rhymes," this work demonstrates that macro-aware retrieval yields robust, explainable forecasts under distributional change.

<div> malicious noise, nasty noise, computational learning theory, noise tolerance, cryptographic assumptions  

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. The paper studies the capabilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning Boolean functions in the presence of adversarial noise, focusing on two noise models: malicious noise and nasty noise.  
2. Malicious noise allows an adversary to corrupt a random subset of examples, while nasty noise allows corruption of an adversarially chosen subset.  
3. The authors analyze both distribution-independent learning and fixed-distribution learning settings, revealing starkly different behaviors between them.  
4. For distribution-independent learning, they prove a strong equivalence: if a class of functions can be efficiently learned under a certain malicious noise rate η, it can also be learned under the same rate of nasty noise.  
5. Conversely, in the fixed-distribution setting, they demonstrate a potentially unbounded gap between the noise rates tolerated for malicious versus nasty noise, assuming standard cryptographic assumptions. For any large ratio r, there exists a concept class where the tolerated malicious noise rate exceeds that of nasty noise by a factor of r.  
6. To mitigate this negative fixed-distribution result, the paper introduces a natural class of algorithms named ICE (Ignore Contradictory Examples). They prove that for ICE learners, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate.  
7. Finally, under the standard cryptographic assumption, they show this factor of two gap for ICE learners is necessary and cannot be improved. <div>
arXiv:2511.09763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relative abilities and limitations of computationally efficient algorithms for learning in the presence of noise, under two well-studied and challenging adversarial noise models for learning Boolean functions: malicious noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt a random subset of examples given to the learner; and nasty noise, in which an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt an adversarially chosen subset of examples given to the learner.
  We consider both the distribution-independent and fixed-distribution settings. Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $\eta$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $\eta$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $\eta_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $\eta_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.
  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $\eta$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $\eta/2$-rate nasty noise. We further show that the above factor of two is necessary, again under a standard cryptographic assumption.

<div> Keywords: sleep stage classification, hierarchical modeling, multimodal fusion, Transformers, interpretability  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper introduces NeuroLingua, a novel language-inspired framework treating sleep as a structured physiological language for automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography data. 1) It segments each 30-second sleep epoch into overlapping 3-second subwindows called "tokens" using a CNN-based tokenizer to capture fine-grained temporal features. 2) The model applies dual-level Transformers to hierarchically model temporal dependencies: intra-segment encoding captures local relationships within tokens, while inter-segment integration aggregates information across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended temporal context. 3) EEG and EOG channel data are embedded separately and fused through a Graph Convolutional Network, enhancing robust multimodal integration. 4) NeuroLingua was validated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive results on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, 0.755 kappa), outperforming or matching existing baselines on overall and per-class metrics. 5) The architecture’s attention mechanisms improve detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, offering a strong basis for interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. Overall, NeuroLingua advances automated sleep staging by unifying hierarchical temporal sequence modeling with multimodal fusion toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications. <div>

Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

<br /><br />Summary:  
1. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is effective in post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning on prompt completions.  
2. Due to low communication overhead, GRPO suits decentralized training where multiple nodes process and share prompt responses as strings concurrently.  
3. The work presents the first adversarial attack targeting decentralized GRPO systems, where malicious nodes inject harmful tokens to poison benign models.  
4. Both out-of-context and in-context attacks demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in corrupting local LLM post-training within as few as 50 iterations, shown through math and coding task examples.  
5. Two defense strategies are proposed based on whether all users train the same model or different models, effectively preventing these adversarial attacks with up to 100% attack stop rates. <div>
arXiv:2511.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated great utilization in post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs). In GRPO, prompts are answered by the model and, through reinforcement learning, preferred completions are learnt. Owing to the small communication volume, GRPO is inherently suitable for decentralised training as the prompts can be concurrently answered by multiple nodes and then exchanged in the forms of strings. In this work, we present the first adversarial attack in decentralised GRPO. We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.

<div> Koopman operator, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures, time-series clustering, invariant subspace, self-supervised learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the unexplained ability of Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a type of self-supervised model, to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. The authors propose a theoretical explanation that the predictive objective in JEPA implicitly drives the model to learn the invariant subspace associated with the system’s Koopman operator. They prove that the idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder learns the system’s regime indicator functions, which correspond to Koopman eigenfunctions. This theoretical claim is validated using synthetic datasets with known dynamical properties. A key finding is that restricting the JEPA’s linear predictor to act as a near-identity operator serves as a critical inductive bias. This constraint steers the encoder toward learning interpretable invariant representations, effectively disentangling the latent dynamics. Additionally, the work highlights the importance of this constraint in selecting meaningful solutions from a set of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima. Overall, the study clarifies a fundamental behavior of JEPAs, bridging modern self-supervised learning methods with dynamical systems theory and guiding the design of more robust and interpretable models for time-series analysis. <div>

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), a powerful class of self-supervised models, exhibit an unexplained ability to cluster time-series data by their underlying dynamical regimes. We propose a novel theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, hypothesizing that JEPA's predictive objective implicitly drives it to learn the invariant subspace of the system's Koopman operator. We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants. We further discuss that this constraint is critical for selecting this interpretable solution from a class of mathematically equivalent but entangled optima, revealing the predictor's role in representation disentanglement. This work demystifies a key behavior of JEPAs, provides a principled connection between modern self-supervised learning and dynamical systems theory, and informs the design of more robust and interpretable time-series models.

<div> Keywords: time series forecasting, multi-task learning, trend classification, regression, interpretable predictions<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces CaReTS, a multi-task learning framework designed for multi-step time series forecasting that integrates classification and regression tasks. The framework features a dual-stream architecture: one branch classifies future stepwise trends, while the other estimates deviations from the latest target variable observation. This separation allows CaReTS to provide more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations. To effectively train the model, a multi-task loss function with uncertainty-aware weighting is proposed to balance the contributions of classification, regression, and deviation estimation tasks adaptively. The authors implement four variants of CaReTS (CaReTS1 to CaReTS4) that incorporate popular temporal modeling encoders such as CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers, enabling flexibility in architecture choice. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS consistently surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecasting accuracy and achieves superior trend classification performance. This work addresses both the accuracy and interpretability challenges in deep time series forecasting models, contributing a novel approach that unifies trend detection and deviation estimation within a single framework. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in deep forecasting models have achieved remarkable performance, yet most approaches still struggle to provide both accurate predictions and interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable. To enable effective learning in output prediction, deviation estimation, and trend classification, we design a multi-task loss with uncertainty-aware weighting to adaptively balance the contribution of each task. Furthermore, four variants (CaReTS1--4) are instantiated under this framework to incorporate mainstream temporal modelling encoders, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CaReTS outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms in forecasting accuracy, while achieving higher trend classification performance.

<div> Keywords: value decomposition, multi-agent reinforcement learning, IGM consistency, dynamical systems, non-monotonic factorization<br /><br />Summary:  
Value decomposition is a fundamental technique in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) that allows centralized training with decentralized execution by breaking down the global value function into local components. Ensuring individual-global-max (IGM) consistency traditionally involves monotonicity constraints that limit model expressiveness or softer surrogate methods that introduce added complexity. This work introduces a dynamical systems perspective by modeling learning as continuous-time gradient flow to analyze non-monotonic value decomposition. The authors prove that under approximately greedy exploration, any zero-loss equilibrium that violates IGM consistency is an unstable saddle point, while only IGM-consistent solutions act as stable attractors, ensuring convergence to optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on synthetic matrix games and real-world MARL benchmarks confirm that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably achieves IGM-optimal outcomes and outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, the study explores the impact of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, offering practical guidance for designing more effective value-based MARL algorithms in the future. <div>

Abstract: Value decomposition is a central approach in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling centralized training with decentralized execution by factorizing the global value function into local values. To ensure individual-global-max (IGM) consistency, existing methods either enforce monotonicity constraints, which limit expressive power, or adopt softer surrogates at the cost of algorithmic complexity. In this work, we present a dynamical systems analysis of non-monotonic value decomposition, modeling learning dynamics as continuous-time gradient flow. We prove that, under approximately greedy exploration, all zero-loss equilibria violating IGM consistency are unstable saddle points, while only IGM-consistent solutions are stable attractors of the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments on both synthetic matrix games and challenging MARL benchmarks demonstrate that unconstrained, non-monotonic factorization reliably recovers IGM-optimal solutions and consistently outperforms monotonic baselines. Additionally, we investigate the influence of temporal-difference targets and exploration strategies, providing actionable insights for the design of future value-based MARL algorithms.

<div> Best arm identification, feasibility constraints, fixed confidence, sample complexity, asymptotic optimality  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This work addresses the problem of Best Arm Identification (BAI) under additional feasibility constraints, which is essential for real-world applications such as drug discovery where performance and safety criteria must be evaluated separately. Unlike prior work assuming simultaneous observation of performance and constraints, this paper considers settings where testing an arm’s performance or each of its feasibility constraints can be done independently. The authors formulate a feasible BAI problem where a decision-maker selects an arm and decides whether to test its performance or one of the constraints. They focus on the fixed confidence setting to identify the feasible arm with the highest performance with probability at least \(1 - \delta\). The paper proposes an efficient algorithm that adapts to the problem difficulty, eliminating arms based on either poor performance or infeasibility. The sample complexity of the algorithm is rigorously upper-bounded, and a matching lower bound is established, proving the algorithm is asymptotically optimal as \(\delta \to 0\). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art BAI methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating its practical advantages. <div>
arXiv:2511.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Best arm identification (BAI) aims to identify the highest-performance arm among a set of $K$ arms by collecting stochastic samples from each arm. In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\ell)$, where $i\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\ell\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \textit{feasible} arm with the \textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-\delta$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \textit{asymptotically ($\delta\rightarrow 0$) optimal}. Finally, we empirically show that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art BAI algorithms in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<div> Keywords: compositional structure, optimization landscape, overparameterized optimization, gradient flow, convergence acceleration  

<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper studies how the compositional structure of neural networks influences their optimization landscape and training dynamics, specifically focusing on overparameterized optimization problems modeled with linear activations. The authors analyze the gradient flow in such settings and demonstrate that global convergence can be guaranteed for any proper, real analytic cost function. When restricting the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, they fully characterize the geometry of the landscape, revealing that essential structural features—such as the position and stability of saddle points—are universal across all admissible costs. This universality depends only on the overparameterized representation rather than the specific problem details. Additionally, the research introduces an imbalance metric that measures initialization conditions, showing that convergence speed can be dramatically improved depending on the initial imbalance. Finally, the paper extends these theoretical insights by discussing their possible generalization to neural networks with sigmoidal activations. Through a simple example, it is shown which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear activation scenario, suggesting broader applicability of the results. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

<div> Keywords: Split Federated Learning, data heterogeneity, momentum synchronization, Step-wise Momentum Fusion, gradient divergence<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the challenges posed by data heterogeneity in Split Federated Learning (SFL), a paradigm that utilizes central server resources to train partitions of a model distributed across clients. Data heterogeneity causes gradient divergence, which negatively affects the global model’s convergence speed and accuracy. To mitigate this, the authors introduce Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), a lightweight and effective framework that synchronizes momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. SMoFi incorporates a staleness-aware alignment mechanism to control gradient divergence by imposing constraints on the server-side submodel’s gradient updates at each optimization step. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SMoFi consistently enhances global model accuracy by up to 7.1% and speeds up convergence by as much as 10.25 times. The benefits of SMoFi become more pronounced as the number of participating clients increases and when training deeper learning models. Consequently, SMoFi is particularly advantageous for federated model training in resource-constrained environments, where efficiency and accuracy are critical. This work provides a promising direction for improving SFL performance amidst the prevalent challenge of data heterogeneity. <div>

Abstract: Split Federated Learning is a system-efficient federated learning paradigm that leverages the rich computing resources at a central server to train model partitions. Data heterogeneity across silos, however, presents a major challenge undermining the convergence speed and accuracy of the global model. This paper introduces Step-wise Momentum Fusion (SMoFi), an effective and lightweight framework that counteracts gradient divergence arising from data heterogeneity by synchronizing the momentum buffers across server-side optimizers. To control gradient divergence over the training process, we design a staleness-aware alignment mechanism that imposes constraints on gradient updates of the server-side submodel at each optimization step. Extensive validations on multiple real-world datasets show that SMoFi consistently improves global model accuracy (up to 7.1%) and convergence speed (up to 10.25$\times$). Furthermore, SMoFi has a greater impact with more clients involved and deeper learning models, making it particularly suitable for model training in resource-constrained contexts.

<div> Learning intersections of halfspaces, polynomial time, statistical queries, factorizable distributions, Jennrich's Algorithm<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the long-standing open problem in Computational Learning Theory regarding whether intersections of two halfspaces can be learned in polynomial time with respect to the margin \(\gamma\) and dimension \(d\). Existing algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time \(d^{O(\log(1/\gamma))}\), and this complexity lower bound is known when using only correlational statistical queries (CSQ). The authors introduce a new algorithm that overcomes the CSQ hardness barrier by working within a broad class of factorizable distributions, a natural assumption that lies between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings. Under these distributions, while CSQ approaches still require quasi-polynomial time even for weak learning, their algorithm achieves polynomial time \(poly(d,1/\gamma)\) by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), thus demonstrating a clear separation between CSQ and SQ complexity in this simple PAC learning problem. The theoretical foundation involves a novel duality framework characterizing the moment tensor structure of the marginal distributions. Building on these insights, the paper proposes efficient algorithms combining a refined version of Jennrich's Algorithm and PCA on random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization method. This work significantly extends the class of tractable distributions for this problem. <div>
arXiv:2511.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning intersections of halfspaces is a central problem in Computational Learning Theory. Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\gamma$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\log(1/\gamma))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).
  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/\gamma)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.
  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms. These algorithms combine a refined variant of Jennrich's Algorithm with PCA over random projections of the moment tensor, along with a gradient-descent-based non-convex optimization framework.

<div> Keywords: Annotation with Critical Thinking, large language models, human annotation efficiency, multimodal understanding, loss function optimization<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline designed to improve supervised learning by enhancing annotation quality while drastically reducing human effort. First, ACT leverages large language models (LLMs) not only as annotators but also as critical judges to identify potential labeling errors, allowing humans to focus only on reviewing the most "suspicious" cases, thus increasing efficiency. Second, the approach is versatile and applicable across multiple domains such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding by utilizing multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Third, through extensive empirical studies, the authors distill 7 key insights related to improving annotation quality and cost-effectiveness, which are then translated into accessible guidelines for practical use. Fourth, a theoretical analysis is provided outlining modifications to the loss function that enable models trained on ACT-generated data to achieve comparable performance to those trained with fully human-labeled data. Finally, experimentation demonstrates that ACT can reduce the model performance gap to less than 2% on standard benchmarks while cutting human annotation costs by up to 90%, indicating a significant advancement in scalable, high-quality data annotation strategies. <div>

Abstract: Supervised learning relies on high-quality labeled data, but obtaining such data through human annotation is both expensive and time-consuming. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) for annotation, but LLM-generated labels still fall short of human-level quality. To address this problem, we propose the Annotation with Critical Thinking (ACT) data pipeline, where LLMs serve not only as annotators but also as judges to critically identify potential errors. Human effort is then directed towards reviewing only the most "suspicious" cases, significantly improving the human annotation efficiency. Our major contributions are as follows: (1) ACT is applicable to a wide range of domains, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and multimodal understanding, by leveraging multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs). (2) Through empirical studies, we derive 7 insights on how to enhance annotation quality while efficiently reducing the human cost, and then translate these findings into user-friendly guidelines. (3) We theoretically analyze how to modify the loss function so that models trained on ACT data achieve similar performance to those trained on fully human-annotated data. Our experiments show that the performance gap can be reduced to less than 2% on most benchmark datasets while saving up to 90% of human costs.

<div> Speculative decoding, language models, drafter-verifier alignment, pretrained drafters, steering vector<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the inefficiencies in speculative decoding for language model inference caused by misalignment between the drafter and verifier components, which limits the number of tokens accepted and reduces overall performance. Two common approaches to drafting are analyzed: small drafting heads trained from scratch, which are fast but less effective when verification latency dominates or input distributions shift, and pretrained drafters, which generate higher acceptance rates due to stronger generation quality but have higher latency. To improve acceptance rates without sacrificing speed, the authors propose a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism that introduces a steering vector computed from the verifier’s hidden states into the pretrained drafter. This method enhances the synergy between drafter and verifier dynamically during decoding. The proposed approach outperforms existing offline alignment methods, such as distillation, by boosting accepted tokens by up to 35% under standard sampling and 22% under greedy sampling, all while adding negligible computational cost. Furthermore, this technique can be applied retroactively to existing pretrained models and architectures, facilitating quick integration into current workflows and accelerating language model inference efficiency with minimal changes. <div>
arXiv:2511.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates language model inference by separating generation into fast drafting and parallel verification. Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\% under standard sampling and 22\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead. Importantly, our approach can be retrofitted to existing architectures and pretrained models, enabling rapid adoption.

<div> Keywords: continual learning, multimodal survival analysis, catastrophic forgetting, mixture of experts, feature constrained replay<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Survival prediction for cancer patients is critical in clinical practice to guide treatment and assess mortality risks, but models trained on single static datasets lack adaptability to dynamically evolving data.<br />2. Continual learning (CL) offers a way to update models over time with new datasets; however, existing CL methods primarily address unimodal data and face severe catastrophic forgetting when applied to survival prediction.<br />3. Multimodal data, such as whole slide images combined with genomics, provide richer, complementary information, yet current methods often overlook complex inter-modal relationships, harming performance.<br />4. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) framework tailored for survival analysis, which integrates two innovations: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) to learn shared and task-specific knowledge across modalities and learning stages, and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR) to reduce forgetting by limiting the deviation of previously learned features at encoder and fusion levels.<br />5. They introduce MSAIL, a new benchmark combining four datasets for a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal continual learning in survival prediction, with experimental results showing that ConSurv surpasses existing methods on multiple performance metrics. <div>

Abstract: Survival prediction of cancers is crucial for clinical practice, as it informs mortality risks and influences treatment plans. However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.

<div> Keywords: machine unlearning, large language models, privacy, adversarial recovery, regulatory frameworks<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the critical challenge of ensuring that large language models (LLMs) can permanently forget sensitive information once it has been used. It highlights that retraining models from scratch is prohibitively expensive and existing unlearning methods are often fragmented, unverifiable, and vulnerable to adversarial attempts at recovery. The survey reviews current techniques to evaluate whether forgetting has effectively occurred and examines the resilience of unlearned models against attacks. It discusses technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory as promising tools to enhance unlearning capabilities. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of institutional safeguards, including auditing processes and regulatory frameworks, to build user trust, especially when model complexity or proprietary restrictions limit transparency. The review finds ongoing progress but identifies that robust, verifiable unlearning remains an unresolved problem in the field. The authors call for more efficient unlearning methods that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance mechanisms that reinforce accountability. Ultimately, the study proposes integrating technical innovations with organizational policies to enable AI systems that can be required to forget, thereby protecting privacy and maintaining public trust in sensitive applications. <div>

Abstract: The growing use of large language models in sensitive domains has exposed a critical weakness: the inability to ensure that private information can be permanently forgotten. Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications. By integrating technical and organizational perspectives, this study outlines a pathway toward AI systems that can be required to forget, while maintaining both privacy and public trust.

<title>Uncertainty-Guided Checkpoint Selection for Reinforcement Finetuning of Large Language Models</title>

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, checkpoint selection, uncertainty, large language models, generalization<br /><br />Summary:  
This article addresses the instability and high variance issues encountered during reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). It highlights the difficulty of selecting the best model checkpoint since evaluating each checkpoint on a validation set is computationally expensive and requires an appropriate validation dataset, while simply choosing the final checkpoint might not yield optimal results. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose an uncertainty-guided checkpoint selection (UGCS) method. UGCS leverages per-sample uncertainty to identify difficult question-answer pairs and ranks checkpoints based on their performance on these challenging samples. By averaging the rewards of the top uncertain samples over a short training period, UGCS generates a stable and discriminative signal for checkpoint selection without extra computation or forward passes. The method was tested on three datasets and three different large language models, demonstrating consistent selection of checkpoints that generalize better compared to traditional approaches relying on training or validation performance. Ultimately, the findings suggest that models exhibiting low uncertainty on their hardest tasks tend to be more reliable and robust overall. <div>
arXiv:2511.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning is crucial to aligning large language models (LLMs), but the process is notoriously unstable and exhibits high variance across model checkpoints. In practice, selecting the best checkpoint is challenging: evaluating checkpoints on the validation set during training is computationally expensive and requires a good validation set, while relying on the final checkpoint provides no guarantee of good performance. We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead. Experiments across three datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that it consistently identifies checkpoints with stronger generalization, outperforming traditional strategies such as relying on training or validation performance. These results highlight that models solving their hardest tasks with low uncertainty are the most reliable overall.

<div> Keywords: continual learning, expandable memory, class-incremental learning, orthogonal regularization, feature extraction<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper addresses the limitations of current continual learning methods that treat sequential tasks in isolation, hindering the exploitation of useful relationships between tasks and causing redundant or overly distinct feature learning. To overcome this, the authors propose a novel fully differentiable, exemplar-free, and expandable framework consisting of two complementary memories: one that captures shared common features usable across all tasks, and another that integrates these shared features to learn discriminative, sample-specific characteristics. Both memory modules are differentiable, enabling autonomous learning of latent representations per sample. The approach includes a memory adjustment module that adaptively prunes essential memory slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts in each task. Additionally, orthogonal regularization is employed to enforce geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components, mitigating interference. Experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses 14 state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods, yielding final accuracies of 55.13%, 37.24%, and 30.11%, respectively. Further analysis confirms that effective knowledge integration and utilization leads to improved average performance across sequential tasks and achieves feature extraction quality approaching the upper bound, establishing a new benchmark in continual learning research. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning methods used to force neural networks to process sequential tasks in isolation, preventing them from leveraging useful inter-task relationships and causing them to repeatedly relearn similar features or overly differentiate them. To address this problem, we propose a fully differentiable, exemplar-free expandable method composed of two complementary memories: One learns common features that can be used across all tasks, and the other combines the shared features to learn discriminative characteristics unique to each sample. Both memories are differentiable so that the network can autonomously learn latent representations for each sample. For each task, the memory adjustment module adaptively prunes critical slots and minimally expands capacity to accommodate new concepts, and orthogonal regularization enforces geometric separation between preserved and newly learned memory components to prevent interference. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that the proposed method outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods for class-incremental learning, achieving final accuracies of 55.13\%, 37.24\%, and 30.11\%, respectively. Additional analysis confirms that, through effective integration and utilization of knowledge, the proposed method can increase average performance across sequential tasks, and it produces feature extraction results closest to the upper bound, thus establishing a new milestone in continual learning.

<div> Keywords: fair clustering, scalability, anchor sampling, optimization, ADMM

<br /><br />Summary:  
Fair clustering is essential to reduce bias in unsupervised learning, but existing algorithms often have quadratic or worse time complexity, limiting their use on large datasets. To address this, the paper proposes the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), which enables any fair clustering method to scale linearly with data size. AFCF begins by selecting a small, representative anchor set using a novel fair sampling strategy. Next, an existing fair clustering algorithm is applied to this anchor set, significantly reducing computational load. The framework’s key innovation is an anchor graph construction module that formulates an optimization problem to propagate cluster labels from anchors to the entire dataset while ensuring fairness through a group-label joint constraint. Theoretically, this constraint guarantees that the final clustering's fairness matches that of the anchors. The resulting optimization problem is efficiently solved using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on various large-scale benchmarks show AFCF can accelerate state-of-the-art fair clustering methods by orders of magnitude without sacrificing clustering quality or fairness. This work thus bridges the gap between fairness and scalability in clustering, making fair clustering practical for real-world large datasets. <div>

Abstract: Fair clustering is crucial for mitigating bias in unsupervised learning, yet existing algorithms often suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic computational complexity, rendering them impractical for large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on multiple large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that AFCF drastically accelerates state-of-the-art methods, which reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while maintaining strong clustering performance and fairness guarantees.

<div> Cardiovascular Disease, Electrocardiogram Generation, Diffusion Models, Physiological Simulator, Clinical Knowledge<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a top cause of death worldwide, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for non-invasive cardiac evaluation, but large annotated ECG datasets are limited due to privacy, cost, and workflow issues. 2. Creating realistic ECG signals informed by clinical context is important to support mechanistic insights, data expansion, and privacy-preserving data sharing, yet methods to generate ECGs from text descriptions remain underdeveloped. 3. Existing diffusion-based text-to-ECG generation approaches often neglect the integration of physiological simulator knowledge and real-world clinical experience, which are critical to producing authentic ECG waveforms. 4. The proposed SE-Diff model innovatively incorporates a lightweight ODE-based physiological ECG simulator into the diffusion framework via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, introducing mechanistic priors to ensure physiologically sound signals. 5. Additionally, SE-Diff employs a large language model (LLM)-powered experience retrieval mechanism to embed practical clinical knowledge, enhancing guidance during ECG generation. 6. Experiments on real ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff outperforms existing baselines in terms of both signal fidelity and semantic alignment between text input and generated ECGs. 7. Moreover, the combination of simulator-based and experience-based knowledge boosts downstream ECG classification performance, highlighting the utility of integrating mechanistic and experiential knowledge into generative models. <div>

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.

<title>Explore and Establish Synergistic Effects Between Weight Pruning and Coreset Selection in Neural Network Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09901</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: weight pruning, coreset selection, deep neural networks, computational efficiency, model instability<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper investigates the relationship between redundant model weights and training samples in deep neural networks, highlighting how noisy or redundant samples cause weights to be overtuned and complicate pruning. Conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, diminishing the effectiveness of coreset selection. To leverage this interplay, the authors propose a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST), which alternates between weight pruning and coreset selection to create a synergistic effect during training. A critical challenge identified is the "critical double-loss" phenomenon, where important weights and their supportive samples are simultaneously removed, causing model instability and performance degradation that is hard to recover. This problem arises from the lack of theoretical guarantees in pruning and coreset selection methods within deep learning, explaining why these approaches have traditionally been developed separately. SWaST addresses this by incorporating a state preservation mechanism that stabilizes joint optimization when pruning weights and selecting samples simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate a strong synergy between the two paradigms, producing accuracy improvements of up to 17.83% while reducing computational cost measured in FLOPs by 10% to 90%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach across diverse pruning rates and coreset sizes. <div>
arXiv:2511.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks rely heavily on massive model weights and training samples, incurring substantial computational costs. Weight pruning and coreset selection are two emerging paradigms proposed to improve computational efficiency. In this paper, we first explore the interplay between redundant weights and training samples through a transparent analysis: redundant samples, particularly noisy ones, cause model weights to become unnecessarily overtuned to fit them, complicating the identification of irrelevant weights during pruning; conversely, irrelevant weights tend to overfit noisy data, undermining coreset selection effectiveness. To further investigate and harness this interplay in deep learning, we develop a Simultaneous Weight and Sample Tailoring mechanism (SWaST) that alternately performs weight pruning and coreset selection to establish a synergistic effect in training. During this investigation, we observe that when simultaneously removing a large number of weights and samples, a phenomenon we term critical double-loss can occur, where important weights and their supportive samples are mistakenly eliminated at the same time, leading to model instability and nearly irreversible degradation that cannot be recovered in subsequent training. Unlike classic machine learning models, this issue can arise in deep learning due to the lack of theoretical guarantees on the correctness of weight pruning and coreset selection, which explains why these paradigms are often developed independently. We mitigate this by integrating a state preservation mechanism into SWaST, enabling stable joint optimization. Extensive experiments reveal a strong synergy between pruning and coreset selection across varying prune rates and coreset sizes, delivering accuracy boosts of up to 17.83% alongside 10% to 90% FLOPs reductions.

<div> Incremental generation, flow-based models, orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, universal approximation, Lipschitz maps<br /><br />Summary:  
This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for incremental flow-based denoising models, which have revolutionized generative modeling but lacked strong approximation-theoretic guarantees. It focuses on the largest natural class of self-maps compatible with denoising pipelines: the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the unit cube \([0,1]^d\). The authors demonstrate that incremental generation is both necessary and sufficient for achieving universal flow-based generation within this class. A novel topological-dynamical argument proves an impossibility theorem showing that single-step autonomous flows cannot universally approximate these maps regardless of network architecture or activation function, indicating their limitation. Conversely, by leveraging algebraic properties of autonomous flows, the paper shows that any orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on \([0,1]^d\) can be approximated at a rate of \(\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})\) via a finite composition of such flows, with the required number depending only on the dimension \(d\). Under additional smoothness conditions, this approximation can be made dimension-independent and uniformly controlled. Finally, the authors extend these results by lifting the domain dimension to attain universal approximation for continuous functions and probability measures, enabling pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing 1-Wasserstein error, thereby connecting theory with practical generative modeling. <div>

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.

<div> Dataset Distillation, Inductive Bias, Multi-Teacher Models, ImageNet-1K, Data Diversity<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses limitations in dataset distillation (DD) methods that typically rely on a single teacher model, resulting in synthetic data with biased, overly smooth, and homogeneous samples that lack intra-class diversity and generalization capacity. The authors propose PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a novel framework designed to disentangle architectural priors during the data synthesis process. PRISM innovatively decouples the objectives of logit-matching and regularization by supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model guides the logit matching, while a stochastic subset of models aligns batch-normalization statistics. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that PRISM consistently outperforms existing single-teacher methods (like SRe2L) and multi-teacher approaches (such as G-VBSM), particularly at low- and mid-images-per-class (IPC) regimes. The synthetic datasets produced by PRISM exhibit significantly richer intra-class diversity, verified through a substantial decrease in cosine similarity between feature representations. The paper further investigates strategies for selecting teacher models, comparing pre-distillation and intra-distillation approaches, and proposes a scalable cross-class batch formation technique that enables faster, parallelized synthesis. The authors intend to release the code following the review period, promoting reproducibility and further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Dataset distillation (DD) promises compact yet faithful synthetic data, but existing approaches often inherit the inductive bias of a single teacher model. As dataset size increases, this bias drives generation toward overly smooth, homogeneous samples, reducing intra-class diversity and limiting generalization. We present PRISM (PRIors from diverse Source Models), a framework that disentangles architectural priors during synthesis. PRISM decouples the logit-matching and regularization objectives, supervising them with different teacher architectures: a primary model for logits and a stochastic subset for batch-normalization (BN) alignment. On ImageNet-1K, PRISM consistently and reproducibly outperforms single-teacher methods (e.g., SRe2L) and recent multi-teacher variants (e.g., G-VBSM) at low- and mid-IPC regimes. The generated data also show significantly richer intra-class diversity, as reflected by a notable drop in cosine similarity between features. We further analyze teacher selection strategies (pre- vs. intra-distillation) and introduce a scalable cross-class batch formation scheme for fast parallel synthesis. Code will be released after the review period.

<title>Towards Multiple Missing Values-resistant Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection</title>

<div> Keywords: unsupervised graph anomaly detection, missing values, dual-pathway encoder, imputation bias, latent space regularization<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses the challenge of unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) when node attributes and graph structure information are incomplete, a common real-world issue caused by privacy constraints, data collection errors, or dynamic graph changes. Traditional methods assume fully observed graphs and rely on imputation strategies that can bias the detection by "repairing" anomalies to appear normal. To tackle this, the authors propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a novel framework designed to be robust against multiple missing values in graphs. The approach utilizes a dual-pathway encoder that independently reconstructs missing node attributes and graph structure, preventing error propagation between views. These representations are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space configuration where normal nodes cluster compactly inside an inner manifold, while anomalies are pushed to an outer shell, improving discriminative capability. Furthermore, to reduce imputation bias, the model generates hard negative examples by sampling latent codes just outside the normal region and decoding them into realistic subgraphs and node features, sharpening the anomaly decision boundary. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets with varying missing data rates demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods, confirming its effectiveness and robustness in incomplete graph scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2511.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) has received increasing attention in recent years, which aims to identify data anomalous patterns utilizing only unlabeled node information from graph-structured data. However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk "repairing" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.

<div> Time series forecasting, MLP, seasonal signals, energy invariant attention, dynamic capacity adjustment

<br /><br />Summary:  
Time series forecasting is vital for numerous fields, and while MLP-based models offer competitive performance to Transformers with fewer parameters and better robustness, they encounter challenges such as losing weak seasonal signals, limited capacity in weight-sharing MLPs, and poor channel fusion in channel-independent methods. To overcome these, the paper proposes MDMLP-EIA, featuring three main innovations. First, an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP distinguishes between strong and weak seasonal components, using a zero-initialized adaptive channel fusion strategy to reduce noise and improve integration of predictions. Second, an energy invariant attention mechanism is designed to focus adaptively on different feature channels in trend and seasonal predictions over time while keeping the total signal energy constant, enhancing robustness in the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction process. Third, a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism is introduced for channel-independent MLPs that scales neuron count with the square root of the number of channels, ensuring adequate model capacity as channel dimensions grow. Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets show that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art results in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, validating the proposed approaches as effective solutions for improving MLP-based time series forecasting models. <div>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is essential across diverse domains. While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase. Extensive experiments across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that MDMLP-EIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scalable and generalizable analysis of brain activity is essential for advancing both clinical diagnostics and cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive modality with high temporal resolution, has been widely used for brain states analysis. However, most existing EEG models are usually tailored for individual specific tasks, limiting their utility in realistic scenarios where EEG analysis often involves multi-task and continuous reasoning. In this work, we introduce EEGAgent, a general-purpose framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to schedule and plan multiple tools to automatically complete EEG-related tasks. EEGAgent is capable of performing the key functions: EEG basic information perception, spatiotemporal EEG exploration, EEG event detection, interaction with users, and EEG report generation. To realize these capabilities, we design a toolbox composed of different tools for EEG preprocessing, feature extraction, event detection, etc. These capabilities were evaluated on public datasets, and our EEGAgent can support flexible and interpretable EEG analysis, highlighting its potential for real-world clinical applications.

<title>Autonomous Concept Drift Threshold Determination</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Keywords: drift detection, dynamic threshold, model performance, adaptive strategy, machine learning<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />This paper addresses a critical limitation in existing drift detection methods, which use a fixed detection threshold across all datasets and time periods. The authors note that model performance is highly sensitive to this static threshold, motivating the exploration of dynamic thresholding. They prove theoretically that an adaptive threshold, which changes over time based on data segments, can outperform any single fixed threshold strategy. The proof leverages the concept that combining the best-performing thresholds from individual data segments yields a dynamic strategy superior to any uniform threshold. Building on this theoretical foundation, the authors propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination (DTD) algorithm that enhances current drift detection frameworks by incorporating a novel comparison phase to guide threshold adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations are conducted on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, covering both image and tabular data domains. Results demonstrate that their DTD algorithm significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors, reducing false alarms and late detections while maintaining model accuracy effectively. This advancement suggests that dynamically adjusting detection thresholds in response to data distribution changes is a promising direction for more robust drift detection in machine learning systems. <div>
arXiv:2511.09953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing drift detection methods focus on designing sensitive test statistics. They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted. Extensive experiments on a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, including both image and tabular data, validate that our approach substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art drift detectors.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) has reshaped the dynamics of digital marketing and online consumer behavior. However, predicting the diffusion trajectory and market impact of such content remains challenging due to data heterogeneity, non linear propagation mechanisms, and evolving consumer interactions. This study proposes an AI driven Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates multi source data including social media streams, marketing expenditure records, consumer engagement logs, and sentiment dynamics using a hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Temporal Transformer framework. The model jointly learns the content diffusion structure and temporal influence evolution through a dual channel architecture, while causal inference modules disentangle the effects of marketing stimuli on return on investment (ROI) and market visibility. Experiments on large scale real-world datasets collected from multiple online platforms such as Twitter, TikTok, and YouTube advertising show that our system outperforms existing baselines in all six metrics. The proposed DSS enhances marketing decisions by providing interpretable real-time insights into AIGC driven content dissemination and market growth patterns.

Abstract: Tabular data is the most abundant data type in the world, powering systems in finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and beyond. As tabular datasets grow and span multiple related targets, there is an increasing need to exploit shared task information for improved multitask generalization. Multitask learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful way to improve generalization and efficiency, yet most existing work focuses narrowly on large-scale recommendation systems, leaving its potential in broader tabular domains largely underexplored. Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains. Motivated by this, we introduce MultiTab-Net, the first multitask transformer architecture specifically designed for large tabular data. MultiTab-Net employs a novel multitask masked-attention mechanism that dynamically models feature-feature dependencies while mitigating task competition. Through extensive experiments, we show that MultiTab-Net consistently achieves higher multitask gain than existing MTL architectures and single-task transformers across diverse domains including large-scale recommendation data, census-like socioeconomic data, and physics datasets, spanning a wide range of task counts, task types, and feature modalities. In addition, we contribute MultiTab-Bench, a generalized multitask synthetic dataset generator that enables systematic evaluation of multitask dynamics by tuning task count, task correlations, and relative task complexity.

<title>Rediscovering the Lunar Equation of the Centre with AI Feynman via Embedded Physical Biases</title>

Abstract: This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of machine learning has propelled neural networks to unprecedented success across diverse domains. In particular, multimodal learning has emerged as a transformative paradigm, leveraging complementary information from heterogeneous data streams (e.g., text, vision, audio) to advance contextual reasoning and intelligent decision-making. Despite these advancements, current neural network-based models often fall short in open-world environments characterized by inherent unpredictability, where unpredictable environmental composition dynamics, incomplete modality inputs, and spurious distributions relations critically undermine system reliability. While humans naturally adapt to such dynamic, ambiguous scenarios, artificial intelligence systems exhibit stark limitations in robustness, particularly when processing multimodal signals under real-world complexity. This study investigates the fundamental challenge of multimodal learning robustness in open-world settings, aiming to bridge the gap between controlled experimental performance and practical deployment requirements.

Abstract: We address the general task of learning with a set of candidate models that is too large to have a uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true losses. While the common approach to such challenges is SRM (or regularization) based learning algorithms, we propose a novel learning paradigm that relies on stronger incorporation of empirical data and requires less algorithmic decisions to be based on prior assumptions. We analyze the generalization capabilities of our approach and demonstrate its merits in several common learning assumptions, including similarity of close points, clustering of the domain into highly label-homogeneous regions, Lipschitzness assumptions of the labeling rule, and contrastive learning assumptions. Our approach allows utilizing such assumptions without the need to know their true parameters a priori.

<title>DemoTuner: Efficient DBMS Knobs Tuning via LLM-Assisted Demonstration Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The performance of modern DBMSs such as MySQL and PostgreSQL heavily depends on the configuration of performance-critical knobs. Manual tuning these knobs is laborious and inefficient due to the complex and high-dimensional nature of the configuration space. Among the automated tuning methods, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have recently sought to improve the DBMS knobs tuning process from several different perspectives. However, they still encounter challenges with slow convergence speed during offline training. In this paper, we mainly focus on how to leverage the valuable tuning hints contained in various textual documents such as DBMS manuals and web forums to improve the offline training of RL-based methods. To this end, we propose an efficient DBMS knobs tuning framework named DemoTuner via a novel LLM-assisted demonstration reinforcement learning method. Specifically, to comprehensively and accurately mine tuning hints from documents, we design a structured chain of thought prompt to employ LLMs to conduct a condition-aware tuning hints extraction task. To effectively integrate the mined tuning hints into RL agent training, we propose a hint-aware demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm HA-DDPGfD in DemoTuner. As far as we know, DemoTuner is the first work to introduce the demonstration reinforcement learning algorithm for DBMS knobs tuning. Experimental evaluations conducted on MySQL and PostgreSQL across various workloads demonstrate the significant advantages of DemoTuner in both performance improvement and online tuning cost reduction over three representative baselines including DB-BERT, GPTuner and CDBTune. Additionally, DemoTuner also exhibits superior adaptability to application scenarios with unknown workloads.

<title>Interaction as Interference: A Quantum-Inspired Aggregation Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10018</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10018</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical approaches often treat interaction as engineered product terms or as emergent patterns in flexible models, offering little control over how synergy or antagonism arises. We take a quantum-inspired view: following the Born rule (probability as squared amplitude), \emph{coherent} aggregation sums complex amplitudes before squaring, creating an interference cross-term, whereas an \emph{incoherent} proxy sums squared magnitudes and removes it. In a minimal linear-amplitude model, this cross-term equals the standard potential-outcome interaction contrast \(\Delta_{\mathrm{INT}}\) in a \(2\times 2\) factorial design, giving relative phase a direct, mechanism-level control over synergy versus antagonism.
  We instantiate this idea in a lightweight \emph{Interference Kernel Classifier} (IKC) and introduce two diagnostics: \emph{Coherent Gain} (log-likelihood gain of coherent over the incoherent proxy) and \emph{Interference Information} (the induced Kullback-Leibler gap). A controlled phase sweep recovers the identity. On a high-interaction synthetic task (XOR), IKC outperforms strong baselines under paired, budget-matched comparisons; on real tabular data (\emph{Adult} and \emph{Bank Marketing}) it is competitive overall but typically trails the most capacity-rich baseline in paired differences. Holding learned parameters fixed, toggling aggregation from incoherent to coherent consistently improves negative log-likelihood, Brier score, and expected calibration error, with positive Coherent Gain on both datasets.

<title>GraphSB: Boosting Imbalanced Node Classification on Graphs through Structural Balance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10022</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither category addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that adaptively builds similarity-based edges to strengthen connectivity of minority-class nodes, and Relation Diffusion that captures higher-order dependencies while amplifying signals from minority classes. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 3.67\%.

<title>SVD-NO: Learning PDE Solution Operators with SVD Integral Kernels</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a promising paradigm for learning solution operators of partial differential equa- tions (PDEs) directly from data. Existing methods, such as those based on Fourier or graph techniques, make strong as- sumptions about the structure of the kernel integral opera- tor, assumptions which may limit expressivity. We present SVD-NO, a neural operator that explicitly parameterizes the kernel by its singular-value decomposition (SVD) and then carries out the integral directly in the low-rank basis. Two lightweight networks learn the left and right singular func- tions, a diagonal parameter matrix learns the singular values, and a Gram-matrix regularizer enforces orthonormality. As SVD-NO approximates the full kernel, it obtains a high de- gree of expressivity. Furthermore, due to its low-rank struc- ture the computational complexity of applying the operator remains reasonable, leading to a practical system. In exten- sive evaluations on five diverse benchmark equations, SVD- NO achieves a new state of the art. In particular, SVD-NO provides greater performance gains on PDEs whose solutions are highly spatially variable. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/2noamk/SVDNO.git.

<title>Temporal Latent Variable Structural Causal Model for Causal Discovery under External Interferences</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships from observed data is an important task, yet it becomes challenging when the data is subject to various external interferences. Most of these interferences are the additional effects of external factors on observed variables. Since these external factors are often unknown, we introduce latent variables to represent these unobserved factors that affect the observed data. Specifically, to capture the causal strength and adjacency information, we propose a new temporal latent variable structural causal model, incorporating causal strength and adjacency coefficients that represent the causal relationships between variables. Considering that expert knowledge can provide information about unknown interferences in certain scenarios, we develop a method that facilitates the incorporation of prior knowledge into parameter learning based on Variational Inference, to guide the model estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of our proposed method.

<title>BuddyMoE: Exploiting Expert Redundancy to Accelerate Memory-Constrained Mixture-of-Experts Inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10054</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale language models by activating only a subset of specialized expert networks for each input token, thereby reducing the number of floating-point operations. However, the growing size of modern MoE models causes their full parameter sets to exceed GPU memory capacity; for example, Mixtral-8x7B has 45 billion parameters and requires 87 GB of memory even though only 14 billion parameters are used per token. Existing systems alleviate this limitation by offloading inactive experts to CPU memory, but transferring experts across the PCIe interconnect incurs significant latency (about 10 ms). Prefetching heuristics aim to hide this latency by predicting which experts are needed, but prefetch failures introduce significant stalls and amplify inference latency. In the event of a prefetch failure, prior work offers two primary solutions: either fetch the expert on demand, which incurs a long stall due to the PCIe bottleneck, or drop the expert from the computation, which significantly degrades model accuracy. The critical challenge, therefore, is to maintain both high inference speed and model accuracy when prefetching fails.

<title>From Static Structures to Ensembles: Studying and Harnessing Protein Structure Tokenization</title>

Abstract: Protein structure tokenization converts 3D structures into discrete or vectorized representations, enabling the integration of structural and sequence data. Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural "language". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as "structural synonyms". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple "synonym swap" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our study provides fundamental insights into the nature of discrete protein structure representations and introduces a powerful, near-instantaneous method for modeling protein dynamics.

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs), which combine parameterized quantum circuits with classical neural layers, are emerging as promising models in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines. Our results establish FLOPs-awareness as a practical criterion for HQNN design in the NISQ era and as a scalable principle for future HQNN systems.

<title>Tree-Based Stochastic Optimization for Solving Large-Scale Urban Network Security Games</title>

Abstract: Urban Network Security Games (UNSGs), which model the strategic allocation of limited security resources on city road networks, are critical for urban safety. However, finding a Nash Equilibrium (NE) in large-scale UNSGs is challenging due to their massive and combinatorial action spaces. One common approach to addressing these games is the Policy-Space Response Oracle (PSRO) framework, which requires computing best responses (BR) at each iteration. However, precisely computing exact BRs is impractical in large-scale games, and employing reinforcement learning to approximate BRs inevitably introduces errors, which limits the overall effectiveness of the PSRO methods. Recent advancements in leveraging non-convex stochastic optimization to approximate an NE offer a promising alternative to the burdensome BR computation. However, utilizing existing stochastic optimization techniques with an unbiased loss function for UNSGs remains challenging because the action spaces are too vast to be effectively represented by neural networks. To address these issues, we introduce Tree-based Stochastic Optimization (TSO), a framework that bridges the gap between the stochastic optimization paradigm for NE-finding and the demands of UNSGs. Specifically, we employ the tree-based action representation that maps the whole action space onto a tree structure, addressing the challenge faced by neural networks in representing actions when the action space cannot be enumerated. We then incorporate this representation into the loss function and theoretically demonstrate its equivalence to the unbiased loss function. To further enhance the quality of the converged solution, we introduce a sample-and-prune mechanism that reduces the risk of being trapped in suboptimal local optima. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority of TSO over other baseline algorithms in addressing the UNSGs.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability methods are a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that aim to provide a reason for why a model behaves in a certain way. In this paper, we show a new black-box model-agnostic adversarial attack for post-hoc explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), particularly in the image domain. The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities. We validate the effectiveness of our attack, compute the induced change based on the explanation with mean absolute difference, and verify the closeness of the original image and the corrupted one with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models are largely used in AI-powered real-world applications and value creation. However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals. We further identify model-specific patterns, such as QWEN-Image's near-exclusive focus on East Asian outputs, Kandinsky's dominance of White individuals, and SDXL's comparatively broader but still biased distributions. These results provide critical insights for AI project managers and practitioners, enabling them to select equitable AI models and customized prompts that generate images in alignment with the principles of responsible AI. We conclude by discussing the risks of these biases and proposing actionable strategies for bias mitigation in building responsible GenAI systems.

arXiv:2511.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent generative models are remarkably capable of producing instruction-following and realistic outputs, they remain prone to notable physical plausibility failures. Though critical in applications, these physical plausibility errors often escape detection by existing evaluation methods. Furthermore, no framework exists for automatically identifying and interpreting specific physical error patterns in natural language, preventing targeted model improvements. We introduce Matryoshka Transcoders, a novel framework for the automatic discovery and interpretation of physical plausibility features in generative models. Our approach extends the Matryoshka representation learning paradigm to transcoder architectures, enabling hierarchical sparse feature learning at multiple granularity levels. By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches. We utilize the discovered visual patterns to establish a benchmark for evaluating physical plausibility in generative models. Our analysis of eight state-of-the-art generative models provides valuable insights into how these models fail to follow physical constraints, paving the way for further model improvements.

<title>RI-Loss: A Learnable Residual-Informed Loss for Time Series Forecasting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting relies on predicting future values from historical data, yet most state-of-the-art approaches-including transformer and multilayer perceptron-based models-optimize using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which has two fundamental weaknesses: its point-wise error computation fails to capture temporal relationships, and it does not account for inherent noise in the data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis. This provides rigorous guarantees for RI-Loss optimization while precisely quantifying kernel space interactions. Empirically, experiments across eight real-world benchmarks and five leading forecasting models demonstrate improvements in predictive performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate exploration of protein conformational ensembles is essential for uncovering function but remains hard because molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from high computational costs and energy-barrier trapping. This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that energy-only preference signals can efficiently steer generative models toward thermodynamically consistent conformational ensembles, providing an alternative to long MD simulations and widening the applicability of learned potentials in structural biology and drug discovery.

<title>Improved Offline Reinforcement Learning via Quantum Metric Encoding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10187</link>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with limited samples is common in real-world applications. However, offline RL performance under this constraint is often suboptimal. We consider an alternative approach to dealing with limited samples by introducing the Quantum Metric Encoder (QME). In this methodology, instead of applying the RL framework directly on the original states and rewards, we embed the states into a more compact and meaningful representation, where the structure of the encoding is inspired by quantum circuits. For classical data, QME is a classically simulable, trainable unitary embedding and thus serves as a quantum-inspired module, on a classical device. For quantum data in the form of quantum states, QME can be implemented directly on quantum hardware, allowing for training without measurement or re-encoding.
  We evaluated QME on three datasets, each limited to 100 samples. We use Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) and Implicit-Q-Learning (IQL), two well-known RL algorithms, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. From the experimental results, we find that training offline RL agents on QME-embedded states with decoded rewards yields significantly better performance than training on the original states and rewards. On average across the three datasets, for maximum reward performance, we achieve a 116.2% improvement for SAC and 117.6% for IQL.
  We further investigate the $\Delta$-hyperbolicity of our framework, a geometric property of the state space known to be important for the RL training efficacy. The QME-embedded states exhibit low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity, suggesting that the improvement after embedding arises from the modified geometry of the state space induced by QME. Thus, the low $\Delta$-hyperbolicity and the corresponding effectiveness of QME could provide valuable information for developing efficient offline RL methods under limited-sample conditions.

<title>Towards Leveraging Sequential Structure in Animal Vocalizations</title>

Abstract: Animal vocalizations contain sequential structures that carry important communicative information, yet most computational bioacoustics studies average the extracted frame-level features across the temporal axis, discarding the order of the sub-units within a vocalization. This paper investigates whether discrete acoustic token sequences, derived through vector quantization and gumbel-softmax vector quantization of extracted self-supervised speech model representations can effectively capture and leverage temporal information. To that end, pairwise distance analysis of token sequences generated from HuBERT embeddings shows that they can discriminate call-types and callers across four bioacoustics datasets. Sequence classification experiments using $k$-Nearest Neighbour with Levenshtein distance show that the vector-quantized token sequences yield reasonable call-type and caller classification performances, and hold promise as alternative feature representations towards leveraging sequential information in animal vocalizations.

<title>Beyond MSE: Ordinal Cross-Entropy for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10200</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is an important task that involves analyzing temporal dependencies and underlying patterns (such as trends, cyclicality, and seasonality) in historical data to predict future values or trends. Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss. Empirically, we compared OCE-TS with five baseline models-Autoformer, DLinear, iTransformer, TimeXer, and TimeBridge-on seven public time series datasets. Using MSE and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as evaluation metrics, the results demonstrate that OCE-TS consistently outperforms benchmark models. The code will be published.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the computational power of Transformer models, which have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. Yet understanding and extending the principles underlying self-attention remains a key challenge for advancing artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\'evy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states. Together, these results establish FNA as a principled mechanism connecting self-attention, stochastic dynamics, and geometry, providing an interpretable, biologically grounded foundation for powerful, neuroscience-inspired AI.

<title>Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection via Variational Domain-Invariant Learning with Test-Time Training</title>

Abstract: Out-of-context misinformation (OOC) is a low-cost form of misinformation in news reports, which refers to place authentic images into out-of-context or fabricated image-text pairings. This problem has attracted significant attention from researchers in recent years. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency or generating explanations. However, these approaches assume that the training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. When encountering novel news domains, models tend to perform poorly due to the lack of prior knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{VDT} to enhance the domain adaptation capability for OOC misinformation detection by learning domain-invariant features and test-time training mechanisms. Domain-Invariant Variational Align module is employed to jointly encodes source and target domain data to learn a separable distributional space domain-invariant features. For preserving semantic integrity, we utilize domain consistency constraint module to reconstruct the source and target domain latent distribution. During testing phase, we adopt the test-time training strategy and confidence-variance filtering module to dynamically updating the VAE encoder and classifier, facilitating the model's adaptation to the target domain distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on the benchmark dataset NewsCLIPpings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under most domain adaptation settings.

<title>FedCure: Mitigating Participation Bias in Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning with Non-IID Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10227</link>

Abstract: While semi-asynchronous federated learning (SAFL) combines the efficiency of synchronous training with the flexibility of asynchronous updates, it inherently suffers from participation bias, which is further exacerbated by non-IID data distributions. More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.

arXiv:2511.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While promising, graph reasoners based on Large Language Models (LLMs) lack built-in invariance to symmetries in graph representations. Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns. We systematically analyze these effects, studying how fine-tuning impacts encoding sensitivity as well generalization on unseen tasks. We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated exceptional in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling applications across natural language processing, computer vision, and sequential decision-making. In reinforcement learning, ICL reframes learning as a supervised problem, facilitating task adaptation without parameter updates. Building on prior work leveraging transformers for sequential decision-making, we propose Heuristic Transformer (HT), an in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) approach that augments the in-context dataset with a belief distribution over rewards to achieve better decision-making. Using a variational auto-encoder (VAE), a low-dimensional stochastic variable is learned to represent the posterior distribution over rewards, which is incorporated alongside an in-context dataset and query states as prompt to the transformer policy. We assess the performance of HT across the Darkroom, Miniworld, and MuJoCo environments, showing that it consistently surpasses comparable baselines in terms of both effectiveness and generalization. Our method presents a promising direction to bridge the gap between belief-based augmentations and transformer-based decision-making.

Abstract: Reliable, generalizable data foundations are critical for enabling large-scale models in computational lithography. However, essential tasks-mask generation, rule violation detection, and layout optimization-are often handled in isolation, hindered by scarce datasets and limited modeling approaches. To address these challenges, we introduce Unitho, a unified multi-task large vision model built upon the Transformer architecture. Trained on a large-scale industrial lithography simulation dataset with hundreds of thousands of cases, Unitho supports end-to-end mask generation, lithography simulation, and rule violation detection. By enabling agile and high-fidelity lithography simulation, Unitho further facilitates the construction of robust data foundations for intelligent EDA. Experimental results validate its effectiveness and generalizability, with performance substantially surpassing academic baselines.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including computer vision and natural language processing. However, they often struggle to accurately quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, limiting their broader adoption in critical real-world applications. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Deep Learning seeks to address this challenge by providing methods to improve the reliability of uncertainty estimates. Although numerous techniques have been proposed, a unified tool offering a seamless workflow to evaluate and integrate these methods remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce Torch-Uncertainty, a PyTorch and Lightning-based framework designed to streamline DNN training and evaluation with UQ techniques and metrics. In this paper, we outline the foundational principles of our library and present comprehensive experimental results that benchmark a diverse set of UQ methods across classification, segmentation, and regression tasks.

Abstract: Since Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly being integrated into everyday tools and intelligent agents, growing concerns have arisen regarding their possible output of unsafe contents, ranging from toxic language and biased imagery to privacy violations and harmful misinformation. Current safety benchmarks remain highly limited in both modality coverage and performance evaluations, often neglecting the extensive landscape of content safety. In this work, we introduce OutSafe-Bench, the first most comprehensive content safety evaluation test suite designed for the multimodal era. OutSafe-Bench includes a large-scale dataset that spans four modalities, featuring over 18,000 bilingual (Chinese and English) text prompts, 4,500 images, 450 audio clips and 450 videos, all systematically annotated across nine critical content risk categories. In addition to the dataset, we introduce a Multidimensional Cross Risk Score (MCRS), a novel metric designed to model and assess overlapping and correlated content risks across different categories. To ensure fair and robust evaluation, we propose FairScore, an explainable automated multi-reviewer weighted aggregation framework. FairScore selects top-performing models as adaptive juries, thereby mitigating biases from single-model judgments and enhancing overall evaluation reliability. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals persistent and substantial safety vulnerabilities, underscoring the pressing need for robust safeguards in MLLMs.

<title>PITE: Multi-Prototype Alignment for Individual Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Estimating Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) from observational data is challenging due to confounding bias. Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \textbf{ITE} estimation (\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PITE outperforms 13 state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate and robust ITE estimation.

<title>EDGC: Entropy-driven Dynamic Gradient Compression for Efficient LLM Training</title>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Abstract: Decentralized cooperative multi-agent multi-armed bandits (DeCMA2B) considers how multiple agents collaborate in a decentralized multi-armed bandit setting. Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information. We also conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

Abstract: Given i.i.d.~samples from an unknown distribution $P$, the goal of distribution learning is to recover the parameters of a distribution that is close to $P$. When $P$ belongs to the class of product distributions on the Boolean hypercube $\{0,1\}^d$, it is known that $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary to learn $P$ within total variation (TV) distance $\varepsilon$. We revisit this problem when the learner is also given as advice the parameters of a product distribution $Q$. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to learn $P$ within TV distance $\varepsilon$ that has sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d^{1-\eta}/\varepsilon^2)$, if $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1 < \varepsilon d^{0.5 - \Omega(\eta)}$. Here, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ are the mean vectors of $P$ and $Q$ respectively, and no bound on $\|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}\|_1$ is known to the algorithm a priori.

Abstract: Kernel power $k$-means (KPKM) leverages a family of means to mitigate local minima issues in kernel $k$-means. However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and clustering accuracy of the proposed methods compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly enhance human productivity by reasoning, using tools, and executing complex tasks in diverse environments. However, current approaches to developing such agents remain costly and inefficient, as they typically require manually constructed task datasets and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines with extensive random exploration. These limitations lead to prohibitively high data-construction costs, low exploration efficiency, and poor sample utilization. To address these challenges, we present AgentEvolver, a self-evolving agent system that leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to drive autonomous agent learning. AgentEvolver introduces three synergistic mechanisms: (i) self-questioning, which enables curiosity-driven task generation in novel environments, reducing dependence on handcrafted datasets; (ii) self-navigating, which improves exploration efficiency through experience reuse and hybrid policy guidance; and (iii) self-attributing, which enhances sample efficiency by assigning differentiated rewards to trajectory states and actions based on their contribution. By integrating these mechanisms into a unified framework, AgentEvolver enables scalable, cost-effective, and continual improvement of agent capabilities. Preliminary experiments indicate that AgentEvolver achieves more efficient exploration, better sample utilization, and faster adaptation compared to traditional RL-based baselines.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling complex dependencies in traffic time series. However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module in addressing dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies, while sensitivity analysis highlights the robustness of FedSTGD to variations in hyperparameters.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) rely on inherent fluctuations in their internal parameters (weights and biases) to effectively navigate the complex optimization landscape and achieve robust performance. While these fluctuations are recognized as crucial for escaping local minima and improving generalization, their precise relationship with fundamental hyperparameters remains underexplored. A significant knowledge gap exists concerning how the learning rate, a critical parameter governing the training process, directly influences the dynamics of these neural fluctuations. This study systematically investigates the impact of varying learning rates on the magnitude and character of weight and bias fluctuations within a neural network. We trained a model using distinct learning rates and analyzed the corresponding parameter fluctuations in conjunction with the network's final accuracy. Our findings aim to establish a clear link between the learning rate's value, the resulting fluctuation patterns, and overall model performance. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the optimization process, shedding light on how the learning rate mediates the crucial exploration-exploitation trade-off during training.

<title>Improving Perturbation-based Explanations by Understanding the Role of Uncertainty Calibration</title>

Abstract: Perturbation-based explanations are widely utilized to enhance the transparency of machine-learning models in practice. However, their reliability is often compromised by the unknown model behavior under the specific perturbations used. This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty calibration - the alignment of model confidence with actual accuracy - and perturbation-based explanations. We show that models systematically produce unreliable probability estimates when subjected to explainability-specific perturbations and theoretically prove that this directly undermines global and local explanation quality. To address this, we introduce ReCalX, a novel approach to recalibrate models for improved explanations while preserving their original predictions. Empirical evaluations across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that ReCalX consistently reduces perturbation-specific miscalibration most effectively while enhancing explanation robustness and the identification of globally important input features.

<title>Intrinsic Dimensionality as a Model-Free Measure of Class Imbalance</title>

Abstract: Imbalance in classification tasks is commonly quantified by the cardinalities of examples across classes. This, however, disregards the presence of redundant examples and inherent differences in the learning difficulties of classes. Alternatively, one can use complex measures such as training loss and uncertainty, which, however, depend on training a machine learning model. Our paper proposes using data Intrinsic Dimensionality (ID) as an easy-to-compute, model-free measure of imbalance that can be seamlessly incorporated into various imbalance mitigation methods. Our results across five different datasets with a diverse range of imbalance ratios show that ID consistently outperforms cardinality-based re-weighting and re-sampling techniques used in the literature. Moreover, we show that combining ID with cardinality can further improve performance. Code: https://github.com/cagries/IDIM.

<title>Panda: Test-Time Adaptation with Negative Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Pretrained VLMs exhibit strong zero-shot classification capabilities, but their predictions degrade significantly under common image corruptions. To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

<title>Weak Relation Enforcement for Kinematic-Informed Long-Term Stock Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We propose loss function week enforcement of the velocity relations between time-series points in the Kinematic-Informed artificial Neural Networks (KINN) for long-term stock prediction. Problems of the series volatility, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) test data, and outliers in training data are addressed by (Artificial Neural Networks) ANN's learning not only future points prediction but also by learning velocity relations between the points, such a way as avoiding unrealistic spurious predictions. The presented loss function penalizes not only errors between predictions and supervised label data, but also errors between the next point prediction and the previous point plus velocity prediction. The loss function is tested on the multiple popular and exotic AR ANN architectures, and around fifteen years of Dow Jones function demonstrated statistically meaningful improvement across the normalization-sensitive activation functions prone to spurious behaviour in the OOD data conditions. Results show that such architecture addresses the issue of the normalization in the auto-regressive models that break the data topology by weakly enforcing the data neighbourhood proximity (relation) preservation during the ANN transformation.

Abstract: Normalization is a key point in transformer training . In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.

<title>Maximizing Efficiency of Dataset Compression for Machine Learning Potentials With Information Theory</title>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) balance high accuracy and lower costs compared to density functional theory calculations, but their performance often depends on the size and diversity of training datasets. Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods. Furthermore, MLIPs trained on MSC-compressed datasets exhibit reduced error for out-of-distribution data even in low-data regimes. We explain these results using an outlier analysis and show that such quantitative conclusions could not be achieved with conventional dimensionality reduction methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source QUESTS package and can be used for several tasks in atomistic modeling, from data subsampling, outlier detection, and training improved MLIPs at a lower cost.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation estimation is critical for hydrological applications, especially in the Global South where ground-based observation networks are sparse and forecasting skill is limited. Existing satellite-based precipitation products often rely on the longwave infrared channel alone or are calibrated with data that can introduce significant errors, particularly at sub-daily timescales. This study introduces Oya, a novel real-time precipitation retrieval algorithm utilizing the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR) observations from geostationary (GEO) satellites. Oya employs a two-stage deep learning approach, combining two U-Net models: one for precipitation detection and another for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), to address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events. The models are trained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and pre-trained on IMERG-Final retrievals to enhance robustness and mitigate overfitting due to the limited temporal sampling of CORRA. By leveraging multiple GEO satellites, Oya achieves quasi-global coverage and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing competitive regional and global precipitation baselines, offering a promising pathway to improved precipitation monitoring and forecasting.

<title>Impact of Layer Norm on Memorization and Generalization in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) is one of the fundamental components in transformers that stabilizes training and improves optimization. In recent times, Pre-LayerNorm transformers have become the preferred choice over Post-LayerNorm transformers due to their stable gradient flow. However, the impact of LayerNorm on learning and memorization across these architectures remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models. We have validated it through 13 models across 6 Vision and Language datasets. These insights shed new light on the role of LayerNorm in shaping memorization and learning in transformers.

<title>Belief Net: A Filter-Based Framework for Learning Hidden Markov Models from Observations</title>

Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

Abstract: Personalized decision systems in healthcare and behavioral support often rely on static rule-based or engagement-maximizing heuristics that overlook users' emotional context and ethical constraints. Such approaches risk recommending insensitive or unsafe interventions, especially in domains involving serious mental illness, substance use disorders, or depression. To address this limitation, we propose a Responsible Reinforcement Learning (RRL) framework that integrates emotional and contextual understanding with ethical considerations into the sequential decision-making process. RRL formulates personalization as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the agent optimizes engagement and adherence while ensuring emotional alignment and ethical safety. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that explicitly balances short-term behavioral engagement with long-term user well-being, and define an emotion-informed state representation that captures fluctuations in emotional readiness, affect, and risk. The proposed architecture can be instantiated with any RL algorithm (e.g., DQN, PPO) augmented with safety constraints or Lagrangian regularization. Conceptually, this framework operationalizes empathy and responsibility within machine learning policy optimization, bridging safe RL, affective computing and responsible AI. We discuss the implications of this approach for human-centric domains such as behavioral health, education, and digital therapeutics, and outline simulation-based validation paths for future empirical work. This paper aims to initiate a methodological conversation about ethically aligned reinforcement learning for emotionally aware and trustworthy personalization systems.

<title>Semi-Unified Sparse Dictionary Learning with Learnable Top-K LISTA and FISTA Encoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-unified sparse dictionary learning framework that bridges the gap between classical sparse models and modern deep architectures. Specifically, the method integrates strict Top-$K$ LISTA and its convex FISTA-based variant (LISTAConv) into the discriminative LC-KSVD2 model, enabling co-evolution between the sparse encoder and the dictionary under supervised or unsupervised regimes. This unified design retains the interpretability of traditional sparse coding while benefiting from efficient, differentiable training.
  We further establish a PALM-style convergence analysis for the convex variant, ensuring theoretical stability under block alternation. Experimentally, our method achieves 95.6\% on CIFAR-10, 86.3\% on CIFAR-100, and 88.5\% on TinyImageNet with faster convergence and lower memory cost ($<$4GB GPU). The results confirm that the proposed LC-KSVD2 + LISTA/LISTAConv pipeline offers an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for modern deep architectures.

Abstract: Few-pixel attacks mislead a classifier by modifying a few pixels of an image. Their perturbation space is an $\ell_0$-ball, which is not convex, unlike $\ell_p$-balls for $p\geq1$. However, existing local robustness verifiers typically scale by relying on linear bound propagation, which captures convex perturbation spaces. We show that the convex hull of an $\ell_0$-ball is the intersection of its bounding box and an asymmetrically scaled $\ell_1$-like polytope. The volumes of the convex hull and this polytope are nearly equal as the input dimension increases. We then show a linear bound propagation that precisely computes bounds over the convex hull and is significantly tighter than bound propagations over the bounding box or our $\ell_1$-like polytope. This bound propagation scales the state-of-the-art $\ell_0$ verifier on its most challenging robustness benchmarks by 1.24x-7.07x, with a geometric mean of 3.16.

Abstract: Batched synthesis and testing of molecular designs is the key bottleneck of drug development. There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.

Abstract: The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $\Omega(k)$ and $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.

Abstract: AI agents increasingly rely on external tools to solve complex, long-horizon tasks. Advancing such agents requires reproducible evaluation and large-scale training in controllable, diverse, and realistic tool-use environments. However, real-world APIs are limited in availability, domain coverage, and stability, often requiring access keys and imposing rate limits, which render them impractical for stable evaluation or scalable training. To address these challenges, we introduce SynthTools, a flexible and scalable framework for generating synthetic tool ecosystems. Our framework consists of three core components: Tool Generation for automatic and scalable creation of diverse tools, Tool Simulation to emulate realistic tool behaviors, and Tool Audit to ensure correctness and consistency of tool simulation. To illustrate its scalability, we show that SynthTools can readily produce toolsets that span twice as many domains and twice as many tools per domain as prior work. Furthermore, the tool simulation and tool audit components demonstrate strong reliability, achieving $94\%$ and $99\%$ accuracy respectively. Finally, we construct downstream tasks from the generated tools that even state-of-the-art models struggle to complete. By enabling scalable, diverse, and reliable tool ecosystems, SynthTools provides a practical path toward large-scale training and stable evaluation of tool-use agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/SynthTools.

Abstract: Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) limit the clinical utility of prostate cancer genomics by delaying diagnosis and therapy when evidence for pathogenicity or benignity is incomplete. Progress is further limited by inconsistent annotations across sources and the absence of a prostate-specific benchmark for fair comparison. We introduce Prostate-VarBench, a curated pipeline for creating prostate-specific benchmarks that integrates COSMIC (somatic cancer mutations), ClinVar (expert-curated clinical variants), and TCGA-PRAD (prostate tumor genomics from The Cancer Genome Atlas) into a harmonized dataset of 193,278 variants supporting patient- or gene-aware splits to prevent data leakage. To ensure data integrity, we corrected a Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) issue that merged multiple transcript records, introducing ambiguity in clinical significance fields. We then standardized 56 interpretable features across eight clinically relevant tiers, including population frequency, variant type, and clinical context. AlphaMissense pathogenicity scores were incorporated to enhance missense variant classification and reduce VUS uncertainty. Building on this resource, we trained an interpretable TabNet model to classify variant pathogenicity, whose step-wise sparse masks provide per-case rationales consistent with molecular tumor board review practices. On the held-out test set, the model achieved 89.9% accuracy with balanced class metrics, and the VEP correction yields an 6.5% absolute reduction in VUS.

Abstract: Riemannian symmetric spaces (RSS) such as hyperbolic spaces and symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds have become popular spaces for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for building discriminative neural networks on Siegel spaces, a family of RSS that is largely unexplored in machine learning tasks. For classification applications, one focus of recent works is the construction of multiclass logistic regression (MLR) and fully-connected (FC) layers for hyperbolic and SPD neural networks. Here we show how to build such layers for Siegel neural networks. Our approach relies on the quotient structure of those spaces and the notation of vector-valued distance on RSS. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach on two applications, i.e., radar clutter classification and node classification. Our results successfully demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

Abstract: The growing number of medical tomography examinations has necessitated the development of automated methods capable of extracting comprehensive imaging features to facilitate downstream tasks such as tumor characterization, while assisting physicians in managing their growing workload. However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at http://github.com/compai-lab/2025-MedIA-kiechle and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at https://pypi.org/project/OmniSlicer.

<title>Analysis of the TAIGA-HiSCORE Data Using the Latent Space of Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: The aim of extensive air shower (EAS) analysis is to reconstruct the physical parameters of the primary particle that initiated the shower. The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.

Abstract: Fault zones exhibit complex and heterogeneous permeability structures influenced by stratigraphic, compositional, and structural factors, making them critical yet uncertain components in subsurface flow modeling. In this study, we investigate how lithological controls influence fault permeability using the PREDICT framework: a probabilistic workflow that couples stochastic fault geometry generation, physically constrained material placement, and flow-based upscaling. The flow-based upscaling step, however, is a very computationally expensive component of the workflow and presents a major bottleneck that makes global sensitivity analysis (GSA) intractable, as it requires millions of model evaluations. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network surrogate to emulate the flow-based upscaling step. This surrogate model dramatically reduces the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, thereby making GSA feasible. The surrogate-model-enabled GSA reveals new insights into the effects of lithological controls on fault permeability. In addition to identifying dominant parameters and negligible ones, the analysis uncovers significant nonlinear interactions between parameters that cannot be captured by traditional local sensitivity methods.

Abstract: Non-human primates are our closest living relatives, and analyzing their behavior is central to research in cognition, evolution, and conservation. Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications. Code, models, and the majority of the dataset will be made available.

<title>Classifying Phonotrauma Severity from Vocal Fold Images with Soft Ordinal Regression</title>

Abstract: Phonotrauma refers to vocal fold tissue damage resulting from exposure to forces during voicing. It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. By providing an automated tool for phonotrauma severity assessment, our work can enable large-scale studies of phonotrauma, ultimately leading to improved clinical understanding and patient care.

Abstract: Minerals play a critical role in the advanced energy technologies necessary for decarbonization, but characterizing mineral deposits hidden underground remains costly and challenging. Inspired by recent progress in generative modeling, we develop a learning method which infers the locations of minerals by masking and infilling geospatial maps of resource availability. We demonstrate this technique using mineral data for the conterminous United States, and train performant models, with the best achieving Dice coefficients of $0.31 \pm 0.01$ and recalls of $0.22 \pm 0.02$ on test data at 1$\times$1 mi$^2$ spatial resolution. One major advantage of our approach is that it can easily incorporate auxiliary data sources for prediction which may be more abundant than mineral data. We highlight the capabilities of our model by adding input layers derived from geophysical sources, along with a nation-wide ground survey of soils originally intended for agronomic purposes. We find that employing such auxiliary features can improve inference performance, while also enabling model evaluation in regions with no recorded minerals.

Abstract: Fusion energy research increasingly depends on the ability to integrate heterogeneous, multimodal datasets from high-resolution diagnostics, control systems, and multiscale simulations. The sheer volume and complexity of these datasets demand the development of new tools capable of systematically harmonizing and extracting knowledge across diverse modalities. The Data Fusion Labeler (dFL) is introduced as a unified workflow instrument that performs uncertainty-aware data harmonization, schema-compliant data fusion, and provenance-rich manual and automated labeling at scale. By embedding alignment, normalization, and labeling within a reproducible, operator-order-aware framework, dFL reduces time-to-analysis by greater than 50X (e.g., enabling >200 shots/hour to be consistently labeled rather than a handful per day), enhances label (and subsequently training) quality, and enables cross-device comparability. Case studies from DIII-D demonstrate its application to automated ELM detection and confinement regime classification, illustrating its potential as a core component of data-driven discovery, model validation, and real-time control in future burning plasma devices.

<title>Baby Sophia: A Developmental Approach to Self-Exploration through Self-Touch and Hand Regard</title>

Abstract: Inspired by infant development, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for autonomous self-exploration in a robotic agent, Baby Sophia, using the BabyBench simulation environment. The agent learns self-touch and hand regard behaviors through intrinsic rewards that mimic an infant's curiosity-driven exploration of its own body. For self-touch, high-dimensional tactile inputs are transformed into compact, meaningful representations, enabling efficient learning. The agent then discovers new tactile contacts through intrinsic rewards and curriculum learning that encourage broad body coverage, balance, and generalization. For hand regard, visual features of the hands, such as skin-color and shape, are learned through motor babbling. Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination. The results of this work demonstrate that purely curiosity-based signals, with no external supervision, can drive coordinated multimodal learning, imitating an infant's progression from random motor babbling to purposeful behaviors.

<title>A Fourier-Based Global Denoising Model for Smart Artifacts Removing of Microscopy Images</title>

Abstract: Microscopy such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are essential tools in material imaging at micro- and nanoscale resolutions to extract physical knowledge and materials structure-property relationships. However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images. We believe this proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and will benefit the experimentalists with the proposed design flexibility to smartly tune via domain-experts preferences.

Abstract: Our research investigates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to extract main topics from a larger corpus of written data, as applied to the case of identifying signaling themes in Presidential Directives (PDs) from the Reagan through Clinton administrations. Analysts and NLP both identified relevant documents, demonstrating the potential utility of NLPs in research involving large written corpuses. However, we also identified discrepancies between NLP and human-labeled results that indicate a need for more research to assess the validity of NLP in this use case. The research was conducted in 2023, and the rapidly evolving landscape of AIML means existing tools have improved and new tools have been developed; this research displays the inherent capabilities of a potentially dated AI tool in emerging social science applications.

Abstract: Developing reliable iris recognition and presentation attack detection methods requires diverse datasets that capture realistic variations in iris features and a wide spectrum of anomalies. Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.

Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by disrupted cortical oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.

Abstract: This paper presents and discusses forms of estimation by regularized regression and model selection using the LASSO method - Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. LASSO is recognized as one of the main supervised learning methods applied to high-dimensional econometrics, allowing work with large volumes of data and multiple correlated controls. Conceptual issues related to the consequences of high dimensionality in modern econometrics and the principle of sparsity, which underpins regularization procedures, are addressed. The study examines the main post-double selection and post-regularization models, including variations applied to instrumental variable models. A brief description of the lassopack routine package, its syntaxes, and examples of HD, HDS (High-Dimension Sparse), and IV-HDS models, with combinations involving fixed effects estimators, is also presented. Finally, the potential application of the approach in research focused on air transport is discussed, with emphasis on an empirical study on the operational efficiency of airlines and aircraft fuel consumption.

<title>ProbLog4Fairness: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Modeling and Mitigating Bias</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09768</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2511.09768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operationalizing definitions of fairness is difficult in practice, as multiple definitions can be incompatible while each being arguably desirable. Instead, it may be easier to directly describe algorithmic bias through ad-hoc assumptions specific to a particular real-world task, e.g., based on background information on systemic biases in its context. Such assumptions can, in turn, be used to mitigate this bias during training. Yet, a framework for incorporating such assumptions that is simultaneously principled, flexible, and interpretable is currently lacking.
  Our approach is to formalize bias assumptions as programs in ProbLog, a probabilistic logic programming language that allows for the description of probabilistic causal relationships through logic. Neurosymbolic extensions of ProbLog then allow for easy integration of these assumptions in a neural network's training process. We propose a set of templates to express different types of bias and show the versatility of our approach on synthetic tabular datasets with known biases. Using estimates of the bias distortions present, we also succeed in mitigating algorithmic bias in real-world tabular and image data. We conclude that ProbLog4Fairness outperforms baselines due to its ability to flexibly model the relevant bias assumptions, where other methods typically uphold a fixed bias type or notion of fairness.

Abstract: Accurate and generalizable Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models for turbulent flows rely on effective closures. We introduce tensor-based, symmetry aware closures using equivariant neural networks (ENNs) and present an algorithm for enforcing algebraic contraction relations among tensor components. The modeling approach builds on the structure tensor framework introduced by Kassinos and Reynolds to learn closures in the rapid distortion theory setting. Experiments show that ENNs can effectively learn relationships involving high-order tensors, meeting or exceeding the performance of existing models in tasks such as predicting the rapid pressure-strain correlation. Our results show that ENNs provide a physically consistent alternative to classical tensor basis models, enabling end-to-end learning of unclosed terms in RANS and fast exploration of model dependencies.

Abstract: The widespread integration of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) in smart home environments has amplified the demand for transparent and interpretable machine learning models. To foster user trust and comply with emerging regulatory frameworks, the Explainable AI (XAI) methods, particularly post-hoc techniques such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), are widely employed to elucidate model behavior. However, recent studies have shown that these explanation methods can inadvertently expose sensitive user attributes and behavioral patterns, thereby introducing new privacy risks. To address these concerns, we propose a novel privacy-preserving approach based on SHAP entropy regularization to mitigate privacy leakage in explainable AIoT applications. Our method incorporates an entropy-based regularization objective that penalizes low-entropy SHAP attribution distributions during training, promoting a more uniform spread of feature contributions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we developed a suite of SHAP-based privacy attacks that strategically leverage model explanation outputs to infer sensitive information. We validate our method through comparative evaluations using these attacks alongside utility metrics on benchmark smart home energy consumption datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SHAP entropy regularization substantially reduces privacy leakage compared to baseline models, while maintaining high predictive accuracy and faithful explanation fidelity. This work contributes to the development of privacy-preserving explainable AI techniques for secure and trustworthy AIoT applications.

Abstract: Dynamical system (DS)-based learning from demonstration (LfD) is a powerful tool for generating motion plans in the operation (`task') space of robotic systems. However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture on the LASA and IROS handwriting datasets.

Abstract: This work extends the recently introduced Alpha-Procrustes family of Riemannian metrics for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices by incorporating generalized versions of the Bures-Wasserstein (GBW), Log-Euclidean, and Wasserstein distances. While the Alpha-Procrustes framework has unified many classical metrics in both finite- and infinite- dimensional settings, it previously lacked the structural components necessary to realize these generalized forms. We introduce a formalism based on unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an extended Mahalanobis norm that allows the construction of robust, infinite-dimensional generalizations of GBW and Log-Hilbert-Schmidt distances. Our approach also incorporates a learnable regularization parameter that enhances geometric stability in high-dimensional comparisons. Preliminary experiments reproducing benchmarks from the literature demonstrate the improved performance of our generalized metrics, particularly in scenarios involving comparisons between datasets of varying dimension and scale. This work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for advancing robust geometric methods in machine learning, statistical inference, and functional data analysis.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/kdafnis/STS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference. All codes can be found here https://github.com/ Nikunj-Gupta/hierouter.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) are critical to patient survival in emergencies, but first responders often face intense cognitive demands in high-stakes situations. AI cognitive assistants, acting as virtual partners, have the potential to ease this burden by supporting real-time data collection and decision making. In pursuit of this vision, we introduce EgoEMS, the first end-to-end, high-fidelity, multimodal, multiperson dataset capturing over 20 hours of realistic, procedural EMS activities from an egocentric view in 233 simulated emergency scenarios performed by 62 participants, including 46 EMS professionals. Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics. We also present a suite of benchmarks for real-time multimodal keystep recognition and action quality estimation, essential for developing AI support tools for EMS. We hope EgoEMS inspires the research community to push the boundaries of intelligent EMS systems and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Structured variational inference constitutes a core methodology in modern statistical applications. Unlike mean-field variational inference, the approximate posterior is assumed to have interdependent structure. We consider the natural setting of star-structured variational inference, where a root variable impacts all the other ones. We prove the first results for existence, uniqueness, and self-consistency of the variational approximation. In turn, we derive quantitative approximation error bounds for the variational approximation to the posterior, extending prior work from the mean-field setting to the star-structured setting. We also develop a gradient-based algorithm with provable guarantees for computing the variational approximation using ideas from optimal transport theory. We explore the implications of our results for Gaussian measures and hierarchical Bayesian models, including generalized linear models with location family priors and spike-and-slab priors with one-dimensional debiasing. As a by-product of our analysis, we develop new stability results for star-separable transport maps which might be of independent interest.

Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena.

Abstract: Gradient descent dynamics on the deep matrix factorization problem is extensively studied as a simplified theoretical model for deep neural networks. Although the convergence theory for two-layer matrix factorization is well-established, no global convergence guarantee for general deep matrix factorization under random initialization has been established to date. To address this gap, we provide a polynomial-time global convergence guarantee for randomly initialized gradient descent on four-layer matrix factorization, given certain conditions on the target matrix and a standard balanced regularization term. Our analysis employs new techniques to show saddle-avoidance properties of gradient decent dynamics, and extends previous theories to characterize the change in eigenvalues of layer weights.

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) offer a new direction for advancements in vision architectures. While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.

Abstract: The remarkable progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is foundation-ally linked to a concurrent revolution in computer architecture. As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.

Abstract: Large transformer models, trained on diverse datasets, have demonstrated impressive few-shot performance on previously unseen tasks without requiring parameter updates. This capability has also been explored in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents interact with the environment to retrieve context and maximize cumulative rewards, showcasing strong adaptability in complex settings. However, in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents must coordinate toward a shared goal, decentralized policy deployment can lead to mismatches in task alignment and reward assignment, limiting the efficiency of policy adaptation. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-agent In-context Coordination via Decentralized Memory Retrieval (MAICC), a novel approach designed to enhance coordination by fast adaptation. Our method involves training a centralized embedding model to capture fine-grained trajectory representations, followed by decentralized models that approximate the centralized one to obtain team-level task information. Based on the learned embeddings, relevant trajectories are retrieved as context, which, combined with the agents' current sub-trajectories, inform decision-making. During decentralized execution, we introduce a novel memory mechanism that effectively balances test-time online data with offline memory. Based on the constructed memory, we propose a hybrid utility score that incorporates both individual- and team-level returns, ensuring credit assignment across agents. Extensive experiments on cooperative MARL benchmarks, including Level-Based Foraging (LBF) and SMAC (v1/v2), show that MAICC enables faster adaptation to unseen tasks compared to existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LAMDA-RL/MAICC.

Abstract: Friction modeling plays a crucial role in achieving high-precision motion control in robotic operating systems. Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions. This study provides a new perspective for interpretable and data-driven robotic friction modeling with promising engineering applicability.

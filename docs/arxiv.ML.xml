Summary: <br>
The study focuses on enhancing the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) by integrating multiple inferred networks. It utilizes autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns and prior knowledge from GRN structures through random walks and BERT encoding. Positional encodings of input gene networks are also considered to better identify gene positions within the graph. These embeddings are then combined in a graph transformer-based model called GT-GRN for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively leverages the topological structure of the ground truth network and the enriched encoded information, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. <div>

Abstract: The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-language models (LLMs) has driven extensive research into parameter compression after training has been completed, yet compression during the training phase remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce Rate-Constrained Training (Backslash), a novel training-time compression approach based on rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Backslash enables a flexible trade-off between model accuracy and complexity, significantly reducing parameter redundancy while preserving performance. Experiments in various architectures and tasks demonstrate that Backslash can reduce memory usage by 60\% - 90\% without accuracy loss and provides significant compression gain compared to compression after training. Moreover, Backslash proves to be highly versatile: it enhances generalization with small Lagrange multipliers, improves model robustness to pruning (maintaining accuracy even at 80\% pruning rates), and enables network simplification for accelerated inference on edge devices.

Abstract: The sea surface temperature (SST), a key environmental parameter, is crucial to optimizing production planning, making its accurate prediction a vital research topic. However, the inherent nonlinearity of the marine dynamic system presents significant challenges. Current forecasting methods mainly include physics-based numerical simulations and data-driven machine learning approaches. The former, while describing SST evolution through differential equations, suffers from high computational complexity and limited applicability, whereas the latter, despite its computational benefits, requires large datasets and faces interpretability challenges. This study presents a prediction framework based solely on data-driven techniques. Using phase space reconstruction, we construct initial-delay attractor pairs with a mathematical homeomorphism and design a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Mapping (STFM) to uncover their intrinsic connections. Unlike conventional models, our method captures SST dynamics efficiently through phase space reconstruction and achieves high prediction accuracy with minimal training data in comparative tests

Summary: 
This article introduces a new data-centric pretraining framework for large language models (LLMs) to mitigate the risk of generating harmful or toxic content. Key contributions include a safety classifier trained on 10,000 labeled examples, a synthetic safety dataset of 100B tokens created by recontextualizing harmful web data, RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets for converting harmful prompts, injecting Harmfulness-Tag annotations during pretraining to flag unsafe content, and safety evaluations to measure base model behavior. The safety-pretrained models successfully reduce attack success rates from 38.8% to 8.4% without sacrificing performance on LLM safety benchmarks. This approach addresses the challenge of removing unsafe patterns learned during pretraining by incorporating safety measures from the start, ultimately enhancing the model's ability to generate safe and responsible content.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. We present a data-centric pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the start. Our contributions include: (i) a safety classifier trained on 10,000 GPT-4 labeled examples, used to filter 600B tokens; (ii) the largest synthetic safety dataset to date (100B tokens) generated via recontextualization of harmful web data; (iii) RefuseWeb and Moral Education datasets that convert harmful prompts into refusal dialogues and web-style educational material; (iv) Harmfulness-Tag annotations injected during pretraining to flag unsafe content and steer away inference from harmful generations; and (v) safety evaluations measuring base model behavior before instruction tuning. Our safety-pretrained models reduce attack success rates from 38.8% to 8.4% with no performance degradation on standard LLM safety benchmarks.

Summary: <br>
The article explores the possibility of automated hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) through a theoretical framework. It establishes a connection between hallucination detection and language identification, suggesting the difficulty of detecting hallucinations from correct statements alone. However, with the inclusion of expert-labeled feedback – training the detector with both correct and incorrect examples – automated hallucination detection becomes feasible for all countable language collections. This emphasizes the importance of expert-labeled examples in training detectors and supports feedback-based methods like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for reliable LLM deployment. <div>
arXiv:2504.17004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.
  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.
  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.
  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction, and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN (cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties, enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.

<br>
Summary: Fairness-aware learning strives to reduce discrimination in machine learning models while maintaining predictive accuracy. The study investigates how data sampling during training and testing can impact fairness metrics, suggesting that bias in training data may persist in test data. To address this issue, the FairMatch method is proposed, which applies propensity score matching to assess and alleviate bias. By identifying similar pairs within subgroups and adjusting decision thresholds accordingly, FairMatch effectively reduces bias in test data. For unmatched samples, probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions is utilized. Experimental results show that FairMatch accurately identifies unbiased subsets and significantly mitigates bias in the remaining data, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving fairness evaluation and mitigation without sacrificing predictive performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.17066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

<div> Keywords: Language models, biological sequences, grammar rules, likelihood scores, transformer-based models

Summary:
Language models are being used to predict the viability of biological sequences by learning grammar rules during training. However, in-context learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores, particularly leading to anomalously high scores for sequences with repeated motifs. This effect is most pronounced in transformer-based models, where a look-up operation using repeated motifs as reference can override learned priors. This phenomenon extends to imperfectly repeated sequences and other biologically relevant features like reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences. The study highlights the potential limitations and biases that can arise in the application of language models to biological data, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation and validation of model predictions. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein language models with different architectures trained on the masked language modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold into hairpin structures.

Abstract: Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems, radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity, and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from 411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and clarity.

Summary: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas properties are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle. Retrieving these properties from observations is a complex non-linear Bayesian inverse problem currently solved using the computationally expensive Optimal Estimation algorithm. However, this approach leads to convergence issues and unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates. To address this, a diffusion-based approach is proposed for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, allowing for flexible retrieval of Gaussian or non-Gaussian posteriors with a significant speed-up in computation. Developing fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is essential for upcoming satellite missions, aiming to enable near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks for effective policy-making.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel deep learning hybrid model that integrates attention Transformer and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures to improve the accuracy of cryptocurrency price predictions. By combining the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range patterns with the GRU's ability to model short-term and sequential trends, the hybrid model provides a well-rounded approach to time series forecasting. We apply the model to predict the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with four other machine learning models: two are non-sequential feedforward models: Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and two are bidirectional sequential memory-based models: Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU). The performance of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test. The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks. These findings provide valuable insights for improving real-time decision making in cryptocurrency markets and support the growing use of hybrid deep learning models in financial analytics.

Summary:
The paper introduces a variant of RDF2Vec that incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of entities in knowledge graphs. By expanding nodes through flooding the graph from geographic nodes and biasing graph walks using spatial weights, the approach considers all reachable nodes to learn location-aware embeddings. Evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms non-location-aware RDF2Vec and GeoTransE in learning accurate representations of spatial entities in knowledge graphs. <div>

Abstract: Many knowledge graphs contain a substantial number of spatial entities, such as cities, buildings, and natural landmarks. For many of these entities, exact geometries are stored within the knowledge graphs. However, most existing approaches for learning entity representations do not take these geometries into account. In this paper, we introduce a variant of RDF2Vec that incorporates geometric information to learn location-aware embeddings of entities. Our approach expands different nodes by flooding the graph from geographic nodes, ensuring that each reachable node is considered. Based on the resulting flooded graph, we apply a modified version of RDF2Vec that biases graph walks using spatial weights. Through evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms both non-location-aware RDF2Vec and GeoTransE.

Summary:<br>
The paper introduces the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI) as a tool for monitoring Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training dynamics and identifying optimal regularization hyperparameters. OUI helps in guiding the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training without validation data. Through experiments on various DNN architectures and datasets, the study shows that maintaining OUI within a specific range leads to improved generalization and validation scores. OUI converges faster than traditional metrics like loss or accuracy, enabling early identification of optimal WD values. By using OUI as a reliable indicator, practitioners can tune WD values more precisely for enhanced performance. The code for reproducing the experiments is available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: We introduce the Overfitting-Underfitting Indicator (OUI), a novel tool for monitoring the training dynamics of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and identifying optimal regularization hyperparameters. Specifically, we validate that OUI can effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K, we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy, enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these experiments is available at https://github.com/AlbertoFdezHdez/OUI.

<div> Keywords: intelligent transportation systems, tensor decomposition, traffic speed data, temporal patterns, missing data imputation

Summary: 
Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI) addresses the issue of missing traffic speed data in intelligent transportation systems by combining the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function. This approach improves accuracy and robustness in imputing time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI utilizes a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach for efficient nonnegative latent factor analysis on a tensor. Empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that TATSI outperforms existing traffic speed predictors by capturing temporal patterns more accurately and providing the most precise imputations for missing traffic speed data. <div>

Abstract: In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), traffic management departments rely on sensors, cameras, and GPS devices to collect real-time traffic data. Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function, thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.

Abstract: Many data-driven modules in smart grid rely on access to high-quality power flow data; however, real-world data are often limited due to privacy and operational constraints. This paper presents a physics-informed generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) for synthesizing feasible power flow data. By incorporating auxiliary training and physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Comparative results show that the proposed model outperforms three baseline models in terms of feasibility, diversity, and accuracy of statistical features. This work highlights the potential of integrating generative modelling into data-driven power system applications.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have played a key role in scaling up diffusion-based generative models, as in Stable Diffusion, yet questions regarding their robustness remain largely underexplored. Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.

Summary: 
NeuralGrok introduces a novel gradient-based approach to enhance generalization in transformers for arithmetic tasks. By training an auxiliary module in conjunction with the base model, NeuralGrok dynamically modulates gradient components to accelerate generalization. This approach significantly speeds up the generalization process, particularly in challenging tasks, offering a more stable training paradigm compared to traditional regularization methods like weight decay. The Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric is used to measure and reduce model complexity, showing that NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by simplifying the model.

Abstract: Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing generalization ability.

Summary:
The study focuses on the generalization of downsampling layers for group equivariant architectures, like G-CNNs, on finite groups with anti-aliasing. The algorithm devised can create a suitable subgroup for a given finite group and downsampling rate. The concept of bandlimited-ness is explored concerning groups and subgroups, suggesting methods for anti-aliasing. This approach extends classical sampling theory to downsampling. For signals on cyclic groups, the method mimics traditional downsampling with an ideal low-pass filter before subsampling. Experimental results in image classification tasks illustrate that implementing the proposed downsampling operation enhances accuracy, better retains equivariance, and reduces model size in G-equivariant networks.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downsampling layers are crucial building blocks in CNN architectures, which help to increase the receptive field for learning high-level features and reduce the amount of memory/computation in the model. In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks

Abstract: We propose a symbolic generative task description language and a corresponding inference engine capable of representing arbitrary multimodal tasks as structured symbolic flows. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic. Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner. Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.

Summary: 
The article discusses recovering latent information from graphs under epsilon-edge local differential privacy constraints where relationships between vertices are kept confidential. It focuses on generalized random dot-product graphs and shows that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces geometric distortion in latent positions. By adjusting the statistical inference procedure for privatized graphs, consistent recovery of latent positions is possible. The procedure is proven to be nearly minimax-optimal under local edge differential privacy constraints. Additionally, the framework allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information encoded in the persistence diagrams of the latent positions. This work expands on previous research in private community detection to a broader range of models and inferential tasks. <div>

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under $\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of relationships/edges between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from the data curator. For the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we show that a standard local differential privacy mechanism induces a specific geometric distortion in the latent positions. Leveraging this insight, we show that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information underlying the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our results extend previous work from the private community detection literature to a substantially richer class of models and inferential tasks.

<div> Keywords: Graph Neural Networks, structural imbalance, graph heterophily, HeRB, homophilic knowledge transfer

Summary:<br>
Recent research has focused on the challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in dealing with structural imbalance. Prior solutions did not consider graph heterophily, where connected nodes have distinct labels or features, leading to reduced effectiveness. To address this, a new method named HeRB (Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) is proposed. HeRB includes a heterophily-lessening module to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges, and a homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism. Experimental results show that HeRB outperforms existing methods on various benchmark datasets, with ablation studies confirming the effectiveness of its components. This approach improves the performance of GNNs by addressing the issue of structural imbalance while considering graph heterophily. <div>

Abstract: Recent research has witnessed the remarkable progress of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the realm of graph data representation. However, GNNs still encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB (Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets, and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed components.

Summary: 
The paper presents a novel method, ExOSITO, for ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the ICU. It combines off-policy learning with privileged information to identify the optimal set of lab tests to order, considering both observed and predicted patient status. The approach uses a causal bandit framework trained on offline data and a reward function based on clinically-approved rules. By integrating clinical knowledge with observational data, ExOSITO provides an interpretable tool for clinicians to order lab tests, reducing costs without omitting important orders. The learned policy outperforms a physician's policy and previous methods, addressing the challenge of balancing information availability and clinical burden in lab test ordering. <div>

Abstract: Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO) creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior approaches to this practical problem.

<div> Triggers, Text classifiers, Backdoor attacks, Human evaluation, Subtlety<br>
Summary:<br>
The study focuses on backdoor attacks on text classifiers that manipulate predictions by inserting triggers. Unlike previous attacks that use easily detectable triggers, the new approach aims for subtlety to evade human detection. Through human evaluations, the authors introduce AttrBkd, which utilizes refined trigger attributes for more effective and inconspicuous attacks. Results show that AttrBkd outperforms baseline attacks in both success rate and subtlety. Human annotation reveals discrepancies with automated metrics, emphasizing the importance of human judgment in evaluating attack strategies. This research highlights the potential for backdoor attacks to bypass detection by blending in naturally with legitimate text, showcasing the need for enhanced defense mechanisms against subtle adversarial threats.<br> <div>
arXiv:2504.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined label when a particular "trigger" is present. Prior attacks often rely on triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks, demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of these metrics with human judgment.

Abstract: The recent technological advances in digitalization have revolutionized the industrial sector. Leveraging data analytics has now enabled the collection of deep insights into the performance and, as a result, the optimization of assets. Industrial drives, for example, already accumulate all the necessary information to control electric machines. These signals include but are not limited to currents, frequency, and temperature. Integrating machine learning (ML) models responsible for predicting the evolution of those directly collected or implicitly derived parameters enhances the smartness of industrial systems even further. In this article, data already residing in most modern electric drives has been used to develop a data-driven thermal model of a power module. A test bench has been designed and used specifically for training and validating the thermal digital twin undergoing various static and dynamic operating profiles. Different approaches, from traditional linear models to deep neural networks, have been implemented to emanate the best ML model for estimating the case temperature of a power module. Several evaluation metrics were then used to assess the investigated methods' performance and implementation in industrial embedded systems.

Summary: 
This article addresses the challenge of spurious correlations in predictive models, which can lead to correct predictions for the wrong reasons. The existing approach of maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy requires expensive bias annotations, making it impractical for resource-limited domains. The proposed method reframes spurious correlations as imbalances in class-conditional distributions, offering a simple yet effective solution that eliminates the need for bias annotations or predictions. By leveraging a sample reweighting strategy to balance class-conditional distributions, the method reduces the mutual information between spurious factors and label information, effectively dismantling spurious correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision. <br> <div>

Abstract: Spurious correlations that lead models to correct predictions for the wrong reasons pose a critical challenge for robust real-world generalization. Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information, our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.

Summary: 
The article introduces TCTO, a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework designed to automate feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. TCTO addresses the limitations of existing frameworks by incorporating dynamic dependencies between feature transformation steps. It utilizes an evolving interaction graph that models features as nodes and transformations as edges, enabling the framework to dynamically eliminate low-impact edges, reduce redundant operations, and enhance exploration stability. The graph also provides full traceability, allowing TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations. Comprehensive experiments and case studies demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of TCTO, showcasing superior performance across various datasets. Overall, the framework offers advanced automation and optimization capabilities for feature engineering in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Feature transformation methods aim to find an optimal mathematical feature-feature crossing process that generates high-value features and improves the performance of downstream machine learning tasks. Existing frameworks, though designed to mitigate manual costs, often treat feature transformations as isolated operations, ignoring dynamic dependencies between transformation steps. To address the limitations, we propose TCTO, a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that automates feature engineering through graph-driven path optimization. The framework's core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations. To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance across a range of datasets.

<div> Keywords: social learning, adaptive, online setting, belief update, stochastic gradient descent

Summary:
The article discusses a new strategy called A^2SL for social learning in a dynamic environment. The strategy involves two adaptation stages: stochastic gradient descent to track decision model drifts and adaptive belief updates for changing hypotheses. By controlling adaptation parameters, all agents consistently learn and focus their beliefs on the true hypothesis. The probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to values determined by the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is supported by experiments on synthetic and real data, demonstrating the effectiveness of A^2SL in online social learning scenarios. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs) to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\text{A}^2\text{SL}$) strategy, which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\text{A}^2\text{SL}$ strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.

A new compression scheme is introduced in this paper to reduce the computational requirements for neural network (NN) inference on reconfigurable hardware like FPGAs. The scheme combines pruning through regularized training, weight sharing, and linear computation coding (LCC) to minimize the number of additions needed for inference in a hardware-friendly way. Unlike traditional NN compression techniques that focus on reducing memory usage for storing weights, this approach optimizes for reducing the number of computations.

Abstract: As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper, we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques, where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.

CHASe focuses on identifying unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations to improve data selection efficiency.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning (FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet, existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency, \model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling. Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.

Summary:
The article introduces HMI, a system designed to efficiently serve multiple tenants with distinct pretrained language models (PLMs). By categorizing PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific, hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) are formed to reduce GPU memory usage per tenant. Hierarchical knowledge management is implemented for hPLMs from different tenants, utilizing domain-specific knowledge trees and task-specific knowledge through parameter swapping. System optimizations, such as hierarchical knowledge prefetching and batched matrix multiplications, enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. Experimental results show that HMI can effectively handle up to 10,000 hPLMs on a single GPU with minimal accuracy compromise.

Abstract: The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs), which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.

<br><br>Summary: Climate change impacts urban infrastructure, particularly Combined Sewer Systems (CSS), motivating the exploration of Machine Learning (ML) for forecasting. A protocol evaluates Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting, considering performance, complexity, and resilience.

Abstract: Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub repository.

Summary:<br>
- The paper introduces GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of Byzantine nodes.
- GRANITE utilizes a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS) to track adversarial influence over time.
- An Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT) is used to set aggregation thresholds based on estimates of Byzantine presence.
- Empirical results show that GRANITE can maintain convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes and improve learning speed by filtering poisoned models adaptively.
- GRANITE achieves these results in graphs up to 9 times sparser than current theory allows. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine (model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs than dictated by current theory.

<div> Framework, Plasticity, Optimization, Deep RL, Benchmarking

Summary: 
The article introduces Plasticine, a novel open-source framework designed to address plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems. Plasticity loss refers to the phenomenon where neural networks gradually lose their ability to adapt during training. The framework provides single-file implementations of 13 different mitigation methods, 10 evaluation metrics, and various learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity levels, ranging from standard to open-ended environments. Plasticine aims to fill the gap in the field by offering a unified benchmarking platform for researchers to quantify plasticity loss, evaluate mitigation strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts. The documentation, examples, and source code of Plasticine are available on GitHub at https://github.com/RLE-Foundation/Plasticine. <div>

Abstract: Developing lifelong learning agents is crucial for artificial general intelligence. However, deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems often suffer from plasticity loss, where neural networks gradually lose their ability to adapt during training. Despite its significance, this field lacks unified benchmarks and evaluation protocols. We introduce Plasticine, the first open-source framework for benchmarking plasticity optimization in deep RL. Plasticine provides single-file implementations of over 13 mitigation methods, 10 evaluation metrics, and learning scenarios with increasing non-stationarity levels from standard to open-ended environments. This framework enables researchers to systematically quantify plasticity loss, evaluate mitigation strategies, and analyze plasticity dynamics across different contexts. Our documentation, examples, and source code are available at https://github.com/RLE-Foundation/Plasticine.

Abstract: Data-driven emulators are increasingly being used to learn and emulate physics-based simulations, reducing computational expense and run time. Here, we present a structured way to improve the quality of these high-dimensional emulated outputs, through the use of prototypes: an approximation of the emulator's output passed as an input, which informs the model and leads to better predictions. We demonstrate our approach to emulate atmospheric dispersion, key for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring, by comparing a baseline model to models trained using prototypes as an additional input. The prototype models achieve better performance, even with few prototypes and even if they are chosen at random, but we show that choosing the prototypes through data-driven methods (k-means) can lead to almost 10\% increased performance in some metrics.

Abstract: Traditional time-series forecasting often focuses only on minimizing prediction errors, ignoring the specific requirements of real-world applications that employ them. This paper presents a new training methodology, which allows a forecasting model to dynamically adjust its focus based on the importance of forecast ranges specified by the end application. Unlike previous methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model. This research provides a basis for creating forecasting systems that better connect prediction and decision-making in various practical applications.

Abstract: Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention mechanisms.
  In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%), XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.

Summary:<br>Reservoir computers (RCs) are analyzed in terms of nonlinearity in input data and optimal design. The study focuses on aligning reservoir nonlinearity with data nonlinearity for improved predictive performance. Experiments using the fractional Halvorsen system show that matching reservoir nonlinearity to data nonlinearity maximizes prediction accuracy. When multiple nonlinearities are present in data, matching the smallest nonlinearity results in correct signal reconstruction. A method is proposed for estimating minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by tuning reservoir exponent until successful reconstruction. This method is applied to synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, demonstrating practicality. Enhancing traditional RC architectures with fractional reservoir states improves performance, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios. This research offers a systematic approach to tailor RCs for modeling the complexity of target systems.<br><br> <div>

Abstract: We study how the degree of nonlinearity in the input data affects the optimal design of reservoir computers, focusing on how closely the model's nonlinearity should align with that of the data. By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to model.

Summary: 
The article introduces the idea of Distributed Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (DSLTH) to address the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in decentralized learning. The proposed algorithm involves representing local models as a combination of global parameters and personalized binary masks for pruning. Real-valued parameters are kept constant among agents, while personalized binary masks are updated and fused during learning. A group sparse regularization term is incorporated to achieve structured sparsity and simplify hardware implementation. The algorithm includes a binary mask aggregation process with personalized fine-tuning to align model updates with local data distribution.

Abstract: To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity. Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

<div> Cooperative Task Offloading, Edge Computing, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Transformer-driven Prediction, Latency Reduction <br>
Summary: <br>
Future networks, including 6G, are expected to enable the Internet of Everything, leading to increased demand for computing resources. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers a solution by offloading tasks to nearby servers, reducing latency and energy consumption. However, relying on a single MEC server can result in uneven resource usage and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, a Cooperative Task Offloading framework with Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP) is proposed. This framework leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for asynchronous training, optimizing task offloading and resource allocation across distributed networks. The CTO-TP algorithm significantly reduces system latency by up to 80% and energy consumption by 87% compared to baseline strategies. <div>

Abstract: Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87% energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.

Summary:

- Existing methods with uniform model correction coefficients can lead to over-correction, impacting model performance and convergence.
- TACO algorithm implements fine-grained, client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation to steer local models towards a more accurate global optimum.

arXiv:2504.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data across edge clients have long posed significant challenges to federated learning (FL) training in edge computing environments. Prior works have proposed various methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained, client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable performance in practice.

This paper addresses the issue of limited generalization in learning-based autonomous driving systems. It highlights the need for models that can handle a wide range of road scenarios and accommodate various traffic conditions. The research focuses on designing feature spaces for neural network-based motion planners that can effectively capture diverse road structures and topologies. By employing graph representations of road networks and multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques, the study demonstrates a method to obtain feature spaces that enable generalized learning. The analysis also explores the potential benefits of embedding graph nodes for simplifying learning processes and achieving dimensionality reduction in autonomous driving applications.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: The lack of generalization in learning-based autonomous driving applications is shown by the narrow range of road scenarios that vehicles can currently cover. A generalizable approach should capture many distinct road structures and topologies, as well as consider traffic participants, and dynamic changes in the environment, so that vehicles can navigate and perform motion planning tasks even in the most difficult situations. Designing suitable feature spaces for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces. State-of-the-art graph representations and MDS approaches are analyzed for the autonomous driving use case. Finally, the option of embedding graph nodes is discussed in order to perform easier learning procedures and obtain dimensionality reduction.

Summary:
Machine and deep learning methods were evaluated in comparison to penalized Cox models for survival analysis. The study examined their performance on synthetic and real datasets, testing eight different models including non-linear and non-proportional hazards models. The use of Antolini's concordance index and Brier's score was highlighted as important measures for assessing method performance. Results suggested that the performance of machine and deep learning models may have been underestimated, and the selection of the most appropriate method should consider sample size, non-linearity, and non-proportional hazards conditions. The study emphasized the importance of testing multiple methods to determine the best approach for survival prediction. The code and documentation are available for easy reproducibility of the tests on the benchmark data.

Abstract: Survival analysis often relies on Cox models, assuming both linearity and proportional hazards (PH). This study evaluates machine and deep learning methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets. In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size, non-linearity and non-PH conditions. To allow an easy reproducibility of these tests on our benchmark data, code and documentation are freely available at https://github.com/compbiomed-unito/survhive.

Abstract: Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline) from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.

Abstract: Recent research in Cooperative Coevolution~(CC) have achieved promising progress in solving large-scale global optimization problems. However, existing CC paradigms have a primary limitation in that they require deep expertise for selecting or designing effective variable decomposition strategies. Inspired by advancements in Meta-Black-Box Optimization, this paper introduces LCC, a pioneering learning-based cooperative coevolution framework that dynamically schedules decomposition strategies during optimization processes. The decomposition strategy selector is parameterized through a neural network, which processes a meticulously crafted set of optimization status features to determine the optimal strategy for each optimization step. The network is trained via the Proximal Policy Optimization method in a reinforcement learning manner across a collection of representative problems, aiming to maximize the expected optimization performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LCC not only offers certain advantages over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of optimization effectiveness and resource consumption, but it also exhibits promising transferability towards unseen problems.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted. These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and industry.

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate, limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to improving downstream model performance through influence functions. Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data. Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare analytics.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS, the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node failures and malicious attacks.

<title>The effects of Hessian eigenvalue spectral density type on the applicability of Hessian analysis to generalization capability assessment of neural networks</title>

Abstract: Hessians of neural network (NN) contain essential information about the curvature of NN loss landscapes which can be used to estimate NN generalization capabilities. We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology. Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues and NN loss landscape curvature.

<title>PTCL: Pseudo-Label Temporal Curriculum Learning for Label-Limited Dynamic Graph</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17641</link>

Abstract: Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets. The code can be found at https://github.com/3205914485/FLiD.

<title>Aerial Image Classification in Scarce and Unconstrained Environments via Conformal Prediction</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.

<title>Effortless, Simulation-Efficient Bayesian Inference using Tabular Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a flexible and general approach to performing Bayesian inference: In SBI, a neural network is trained on synthetic data simulated from a model and used to rapidly infer posterior distributions for observed data. A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work, we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN -- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks (NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse problems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle, including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation. Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable, efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

<title>Fault Diagnosis in New Wind Turbines using Knowledge from Existing Turbines by Generative Domain Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17709</link>

Abstract: Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.

<title>Early Detection of Multidrug Resistance Using Multivariate Time Series Analysis and Interpretable Patient-Similarity Representations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17717</link>

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced explainability.
  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.
  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at \https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/DM4MTS.
  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care.

Abstract: In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty. Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, undermining their reliability in high-stakes applications. While adversarial robustness in vision-based neural networks has been extensively studied, LLM robustness remains under-explored. We adapt the Robustness Measurement and Assessment (RoMA) framework to quantify LLM resilience against adversarial inputs without requiring access to model parameters. By comparing RoMA's estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency. Our empirical evaluation reveals that robustness varies significantly not only between different models but also across categories within the same task and between various types of perturbations. This non-uniformity underscores the need for task-specific robustness evaluations, enabling practitioners to compare and select models based on application-specific robustness requirements. Our work provides a systematic methodology to assess LLM robustness, advancing the development of more reliable language models for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, with speech impairments among its earliest symptoms. Speech impairments offer a valuable diagnostic opportunity, with machine learning advances providing promising tools for timely detection. In this research, we propose a deep learning approach for early Parkinson's disease detection from speech recordings, which also highlights the vocal segments driving predictions to enhance interpretability. This approach seeks to associate predictive speech patterns with articulatory features, providing a basis for interpreting underlying neuromuscular impairments. We evaluated our approach using the Italian Parkinson's Voice and Speech Database, containing 831 audio recordings from 65 participants, including both healthy individuals and patients. Our approach showed competitive classification performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing enhanced interpretability by identifying key speech features influencing predictions.

Abstract: Distributional data have become increasingly prominent in modern signal processing, highlighting the necessity of computing optimal transport (OT) maps across multiple probability distributions. Nevertheless, recent studies on neural OT methods predominantly focused on the efficient computation of a single map between two distributions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach to learning transport maps for new empirical distributions. Specifically, we employ the transformer architecture to produce embeddings from distributional data of varying length; these embeddings are then fed into a hypernetwork to generate neural OT maps. Various numerical experiments were conducted to validate the embeddings and the generated OT maps. The model implementation and the code are provided on https://github.com/jiangmingchen/HOTET.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.

Abstract: Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes, rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications, including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.

Abstract: Continual learning in large language models (LLMs) typically encounters the critical challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge deteriorates upon exposure to new data. While techniques like replay buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation, forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This study presents a novel mathematical model derived from cohomology, leveraging the KEEL-proven theorem that establishes cohomology as tautological, generated by boundary classes of curves with fixed dual graphs. Simplicial complexes are constructed using skew-commutative graded algebra, and the structure theorem is applied to connect distinct homologies, enabling precise interpretations of the resulting geometric forms. The proposed model is utilized for protein structure analysis and prediction, with a specific application to the Flagellar Motor structure. This approach offers new insights into the geometric and algebraic foundations of biological macromolecular modeling, highlighting its potential for advancement in structural biology.

Abstract: A key input to energy models are assumptions about the flexibility of power generation units, i.e., how quickly and often they can start up. These assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their flexibility.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.

<title>Engineering the Law-Machine Learning Translation Problem: Developing Legally Aligned Models</title>

Abstract: Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require "indirect" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations. Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning, imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.

Abstract: Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\textsubscript{\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) has introduced unprecedented opportunities while presenting complex challenges around ethics, accountability, and societal impact. This paper draws on a literature review, established governance frameworks, and industry roundtable discussions to identify core principles for integrating responsible GenAI governance into diverse organizational structures. Our objective is to provide actionable recommendations for a balanced, risk-based governance approach that enables both innovation and oversight. Findings emphasize the need for adaptable risk assessment tools, continuous monitoring practices, and cross-sector collaboration to establish trustworthy GenAI. These insights provide a structured foundation and Responsible GenAI Guide (ResAI) for organizations to align GenAI initiatives with ethical, legal, and operational best practices.

Abstract: Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\alpha,\!\beta$-CROWN, which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning involves approximating an unknown functional relationship from a limited dataset of features and corresponding labels. The classical approach to feature-based machine learning typically relies on applying linear regression to standardized features, without considering their physical meaning. This may limit model explainability, particularly in scientific applications. This study proposes a physics-informed approach to feature-based machine learning that constructs non-linear feature maps informed by physical laws and dimensional analysis. These maps enhance model interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking. The method aims to improve both predictive performance in regression tasks and classification skill scores by integrating domain knowledge into the learning process, while also enabling the potential discovery of new physical equations within the context of explainable machine learning.

<title>PACE: A Framework for Learning and Control in Linear Incomplete-Information Differential Games</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters, as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a high-dimensional solution space.

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is critical in medical research. It provides insights into how treatment effects vary among individuals, which can provide statistical evidence for precision medicine. While most existing methods focus on binary treatment situations, real-world applications often involve multiple interventions. However, current HTE estimation methods are primarily designed for binary comparisons and often rely on black-box models, which limit their applicability and interpretability in multi-arm settings. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable machine learning framework for HTE estimation in multi-arm trials. Our method employs a rule-based ensemble approach consisting of rule generation, rule ensemble, and HTE estimation, ensuring both predictive accuracy and interpretability. Through extensive simulation studies and real data applications, the performance of our method was evaluated against state-of-the-art multi-arm HTE estimation approaches. The results indicate that our approach achieved lower bias and higher estimation accuracy compared with those of existing methods. Furthermore, the interpretability of our framework allows clearer insights into how covariates influence treatment effects, facilitating clinical decision making. By bridging the gap between accuracy and interpretability, our study contributes a valuable tool for multi-arm HTE estimation, supporting precision medicine.

<title>Lessons from Deploying Learning-based CSI Localization on a Large-Scale ISAC Platform</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points (APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing baseline.

Abstract: Foundation models have garnered increasing attention for representation learning in remote sensing, primarily adopting approaches that have demonstrated success in computer vision with minimal domain-specific modification. However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the "long-tail challenge", due to the distribution of data including many instances that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.

Abstract: The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of production datasets.

Abstract: In this study, we develop Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Transformer-based transfer learning models for English-to-Igbo translation - a low-resource African language spoken by over 40 million people across Nigeria and West Africa. Our models are trained on a curated and benchmarked dataset compiled from Bible corpora, local news, Wikipedia articles, and Common Crawl, all verified by native language experts. We leverage Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), enhanced with attention mechanisms to improve translation accuracy. To further enhance performance, we apply transfer learning using MarianNMT pre-trained models within the SimpleTransformers framework. Our RNN-based system achieves competitive results, closely matching existing English-Igbo benchmarks. With transfer learning, we observe a performance gain of +4.83 BLEU points, reaching an estimated translation accuracy of 70%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining RNNs with transfer learning to address the performance gap in low-resource language translation tasks.

Abstract: We present Dargana, a fine-tuned variant of the EarthPT time-series foundation model that achieves specialisation using <3% of its pre-training data volume and 5% of its pre-training compute. Dargana is fine-tuned to generate regularly updated classification of tree canopy cover at 10m resolution, distinguishing conifer and broadleaved tree types. Using Cornwall, UK, as a test case, the model achieves a pixel-level ROC-AUC of 0.98 and a PR-AUC of 0.83 on unseen satellite imagery. Dargana can identify fine structures like hedgerows and coppice below the training sample limit, and can track temporal changes to canopy cover such as new woodland establishment. Our results demonstrate how pre-trained Large Observation Models like EarthPT can be specialised for granular, dynamic land cover monitoring from space, providing a valuable, scalable tool for natural capital management and conservation.

Abstract: Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI capabilities but pose considerable challenges for deployment on edge devices due to high computational demands, memory bandwidth constraints, and energy consumption. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an efficient framework for deploying the Qwen2.5-0.5B model on the Xilinx Kria KV260 edge platform, a heterogeneous system integrating an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with reconfigurable FPGA logic. Leveraging Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) with FPGA-accelerated execution pipelines, the proposed approach enhances both model compression rate and system throughput. Additionally, we propose a hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our framework achieves a model compression rate of 55.08% compared to the original model and produces output at a rate of 5.1 tokens per second, outperforming the baseline performance of 2.8 tokens per second.

Abstract: Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady state.
  To accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.
  Our results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training, and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management and understanding complex environmental interactions.

Abstract: Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.

Abstract: The recent global spread of monkeypox, particularly in regions where it has not historically been prevalent, has raised significant public health concerns. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost) algorithm for classification. To optimize the model's performance and generalization, we introduce the African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA) for hyperparameter tuning, ensuring efficient exploration of the parameter space. Our results demonstrate that the proposed AVOA-NGBoost model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 97.53%, F1-score of 97.72% and an AUC of 97.47%. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability using Grad-CAM and LIME techniques, providing insights into the decision-making process and highlighting key features influencing classification. This framework offers a highly precise and efficient diagnostic tool, potentially aiding healthcare providers in early detection and diagnosis, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<title>An introduction to R package `mvs`</title>

Abstract: In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or modalities (called "multi-view data"). Classical machine learning methods ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking (MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive. Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs` makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and provides several options for missing data handling.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.

<title>When Does Metadata Conditioning (NOT) Work for Language Model Pre-Training? A Study with Context-Free Grammars</title>

Abstract: The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.
  Based on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.

Abstract: The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN) for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of 0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically rely on a probabilistic decoder with a predefined likelihood, most commonly an isotropic Gaussian, to model the data conditional on latent variables. While convenient for optimization, this choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data such as images. In this work, we propose \textit{EnVAE}, a novel likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \textit{FEnVAE}, based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that \textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric distribution learning in generative modeling.

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we adopt a survivor-centered approach to locate and dissect the role of sociotechnical AI governance in preventing AI-Generated Non-Consensual Intimate Images (AIG-NCII) of adults, colloquially known as "deep fake pornography." We identify a "malicious technical ecosystem" or "MTE," comprising of open-source face-swapping models and nearly 200 "nudifying" software programs that allow non-technical users to create AIG-NCII within minutes. Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining these gaps.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale in size and adoption, their computational and environmental costs continue to rise. Prior benchmarking efforts have primarily focused on latency reduction in idealized settings, often overlooking the diverse real-world inference workloads that shape energy use. In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient design strategies for future AI infrastructure.

Abstract: Quantum classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate their input classical or quantum data. A promising countermeasure is adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as $1/\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding. For quantum binary classifiers employing \textit{rotation embedding}, we find that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\mathbf{x}$, the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\mathbf{x}$. In contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.

Abstract: When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1) continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial in modern machine learning. Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) and Deep Sigma Point Processes (DSPPs) extend GPs hierarchically, offering promising methods for uncertainty quantification grounded in Bayesian principles. However, their empirical calibration and robustness under distribution shift relative to baselines like Deep Ensembles remain understudied. This work evaluates these models on regression (CASP dataset) and classification (ESR dataset) tasks, assessing predictive performance (MAE, Accu- racy), calibration using Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and Expected Calibration Error (ECE), alongside robustness under various synthetic feature-level distribution shifts. Results indicate DSPPs provide strong in-distribution calibration leveraging their sigma point approximations. However, compared to Deep Ensembles, which demonstrated superior robustness in both per- formance and calibration under the tested shifts, the GP-based methods showed vulnerabilities, exhibiting particular sensitivity in the observed metrics. Our findings underscore ensembles as a robust baseline, suggesting that while deep GP methods offer good in-distribution calibration, their practical robustness under distribution shift requires careful evaluation. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at https://github.com/matthjs/xai-gp.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) on smartglasses has various use cases, including health/fitness tracking and input for context-aware AI assistants. However, current approaches for egocentric activity recognition suffer from low performance or are resource-intensive. In this work, we introduce a resource (memory, compute, power, sample) efficient machine learning algorithm, EgoCHARM, for recognizing both high level and low level activities using a single egocentric (head-mounted) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Our hierarchical algorithm employs a semi-supervised learning strategy, requiring primarily high level activity labels for training, to learn generalizable low level motion embeddings that can be effectively utilized for low level activity recognition. We evaluate our method on 9 high level and 3 low level activities achieving 0.826 and 0.855 F1 scores on high level and low level activity recognition respectively, with just 63k high level and 22k low level model parameters, allowing the low level encoder to be deployed directly on current IMU chips with compute. Lastly, we present results and insights from a sensitivity analysis and highlight the opportunities and limitations of activity recognition using egocentric IMUs.

To address this gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.

Abstract: Learning-based methods, such as imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), can produce excel control policies over challenging agile robot tasks, such as sports robot. However, no existing work has harmonized learning-based policy with model-based methods to reduce training complexity and ensure the safety and stability for agile badminton robot control. In this paper, we introduce \ourmethod, a novel hybrid control system for agile badminton robots. Specifically, we propose a model-based strategy for chassis locomotion which provides a base for arm policy. We introduce a physics-informed ``IL+RL'' training framework for learning-based arm policy. In this train framework, a model-based strategy with privileged information is used to guide arm policy training during both IL and RL phases. In addition, we train the critic model during IL phase to alleviate the performance drop issue when transitioning from IL to RL. We present results on our self-engineered badminton robot, achieving 94.5% success rate against the serving machine and 90.7% success rate against human players. Our system can be easily generalized to other agile mobile manipulation tasks such as agile catching and table tennis. Our project website: https://dreamstarring.github.io/HAMLET/.

Abstract: Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition, we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound separation in natural audio scenarios.

Abstract: Many economies are challenged by the effects of an ageing population, particularly in sectors where resource capacity planning is critical, such as healthcare. This research addresses the operational challenges of bed and staffing capacity planning in hospital wards by using predictive and prescriptive analytical methods, both individually and in tandem. We applied these methodologies to a study of 165,000 patients across a network of 11 hospitals in the UK. Predictive modelling, specifically Classification and Regression Trees, forecasts patient length of stay based on clinical and demographic data. On the prescriptive side, deterministic and two-stage stochastic optimisation models determine optimal bed and staff planning strategies to minimise costs. Linking the predictive models with the prescriptive optimisation models, generates demand forecasts that inform the optimisation process, providing accurate and practical solutions. The results demonstrate that this integrated approach captures real-world variations in patient LOS and offers a 7% cost saving compared to average-based planning. This approach helps healthcare managers make robust decisions by incorporating patient-specific characteristics, improving capacity allocation, and mitigating risks associated with demand variability. Consequently, this combined methodology can be broadly extended across various sectors facing similar challenges, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of integrating predictive and prescriptive analytics.

Abstract: World models for autonomous driving have the potential to dramatically improve the reasoning capabilities of today's systems. However, most works focus on camera data, with only a few that leverage lidar data or combine both to better represent autonomous vehicle sensor setups. In addition, raw sensor predictions are less actionable than 3D occupancy predictions, but there are no works examining the effects of combining both multimodal sensor data and 3D occupancy prediction. In this work, we perform a set of experiments with a MUltimodal World Model with Geometric VOxel representations (MUVO) to evaluate different sensor fusion strategies to better understand the effects on sensor data prediction. We also analyze potential weaknesses of current sensor fusion approaches and examine the benefits of additionally predicting 3D occupancy.

Abstract: As a key component to intuitive cognition and reasoning solutions in human intelligence, causal knowledge provides great potential for reinforcement learning (RL) agents' interpretability towards decision-making by helping reduce the searching space. However, there is still a considerable gap in discovering and incorporating causality into RL, which hinders the rapid development of causal RL. In this paper, we consider explicitly modeling the generation process of states with the causal graphical model, based on which we augment the policy. We formulate the causal structure updating into the RL interaction process with active intervention learning of the environment. To optimize the derived objective, we propose a framework with theoretical performance guarantees that alternates between two steps: using interventions for causal structure learning during exploration and using the learned causal structure for policy guidance during exploitation. Due to the lack of public benchmarks that allow direct intervention in the state space, we design the root cause localization task in our simulated fault alarm environment and then empirically show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Theoretical analysis shows that our performance improvement attributes to the virtuous cycle of causal-guided policy learning and causal structure learning, which aligns with our experimental results.

<title>Effective Bayesian Causal Inference via Structural Marginalisation and Autoregressive Orders</title>

Abstract: The traditional two-stage approach to causal inference first identifies a single causal model (or equivalence class of models), which is then used to answer causal queries. However, this neglects any epistemic model uncertainty. In contrast, Bayesian causal inference does incorporate epistemic uncertainty into query estimates via Bayesian marginalisation (posterior averaging) over all causal models. While principled, this marginalisation over entire causal models, i.e., both causal structures (graphs) and mechanisms, poses a tremendous computational challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by decomposing structure marginalisation into the marginalisation over (i) causal orders and (ii) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) given an order. We can marginalise the latter in closed form by limiting the number of parents per variable and utilising Gaussian processes to model mechanisms. To marginalise over orders, we use a sampling-based approximation, for which we devise a novel auto-regressive distribution over causal orders (ARCO). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art in structure learning on simulated non-linear additive noise benchmarks, and yields competitive results on real-world data. Furthermore, we can accurately infer interventional distributions and average causal effects.

Abstract: This work addresses flexibility in deep learning by means of transductive reasoning. For adaptation to new data and tasks, e.g., in continual learning, existing methods typically involve tuning learnable parameters or complete re-training from scratch, rendering such approaches unflexible in practice. We argue that the notion of separating computation from memory by the means of transduction can act as a stepping stone for solving these issues. We therefore propose PARMESAN (parameter-free memory search and transduction), a scalable method which leverages a memory module for solving dense prediction tasks. At inference, hidden representations in memory are being searched to find corresponding patterns. In contrast to other methods that rely on continuous training of learnable parameters, PARMESAN learns via memory consolidation simply by modifying stored contents. Our method is compatible with commonly used architectures and canonically transfers to 1D, 2D, and 3D grid-based data. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated at the complex task of continual learning. PARMESAN learns by 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than established baselines while being on par in terms of predictive performance, hardware-efficiency, and knowledge retention.

Abstract: The development of machine learning applications has increased significantly in recent years, motivated by the remarkable ability of learning-powered systems to discover and generalize intricate patterns hidden in massive datasets. Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a complexity level that renders them opaque black boxes, lacking transparency and hindering our understanding of their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains requiring informed decisions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing explanations. Feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its ability to delineate the significance of input features in predictions. However, most attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations result from similar or the same instance. This work introduces T-Explainer, a novel additive attribution explainer based on the Taylor expansion that offers desirable properties such as local accuracy and consistency. We demonstrate T-Explainer's effectiveness and stability over multiple runs in quantitative benchmark experiments against well-known attribution methods. Additionally, we provide several tools to evaluate and visualize explanations, turning T-Explainer into a comprehensive XAI framework.

Abstract: Pretraining and finetuning models has become increasingly popular in decision-making. But there are still serious impediments in Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO) with pretrained models. This study identifies two primary obstacles: the Embodiment Knowledge Barrier (EKB) and the Demonstration Knowledge Barrier (DKB). The EKB emerges due to the pretrained models' limitations in handling novel observations, which leads to inaccurate action inference. Conversely, the DKB stems from the reliance on limited demonstration datasets, restricting the model's adaptability across diverse scenarios. We propose separate solutions to overcome each barrier and apply them to Action Inference by Maximising Evidence (AIME), a state-of-the-art algorithm. This new algorithm, AIME-NoB, integrates online interactions and a data-driven regulariser to mitigate the EKB. Additionally, it uses a surrogate reward function to broaden the policy's supported states, addressing the DKB. Our experiments on vision-based control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and MetaWorld benchmarks show that AIME-NoB significantly improves sample efficiency and converged performance, presenting a robust framework for overcoming the challenges in ILfO with pretrained models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \textbf{M}otif-b\textbf{A}sed \textbf{G}NN \textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies are highly susceptible to adversarial noise in observations, which poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. The challenge inherent to adversarial perturbations is that by altering the information observed by the agent, the state becomes only partially observable. Existing approaches address this by either enforcing consistent actions across nearby states or maximizing the worst-case value within adversarially perturbed observations. However, the former suffers from performance degradation when attacks succeed, while the latter tends to be overly conservative, leading to suboptimal performance in benign settings. We hypothesize that these limitations stem from their failing to account for partial observability directly. To this end, we introduce a novel objective called Adversarial Counterfactual Error (ACoE), defined on the beliefs about the true state and balancing value optimization with robustness. To make ACoE scalable in model-free settings, we propose the theoretically-grounded surrogate objective Cumulative-ACoE (C-ACoE). Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, and Highway) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for addressing adversarial RL challenges, offering a promising direction for improving robustness in DRL under adversarial conditions. Our code is available at https://github.com/romanbelaire/acoe-robust-rl.

Abstract: We present GameNGen, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model that also enables real-time interaction with a complex environment over long trajectories at high quality. When trained on the classic game DOOM, GameNGen extracts gameplay and uses it to generate a playable environment that can interactively simulate new trajectories. GameNGen runs at 20 frames per second on a single TPU and remains stable over extended multi-minute play sessions. Next frame prediction achieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation, even after 5 minutes of auto-regressive generation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations help ensure stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories, and decoder fine-tuning improves the fidelity of visual details and text.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian -- the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory -- with up to 6x reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, the normalized Transformer (nGPT) with representation learning on the hypersphere. In nGPT, all vectors forming the embeddings, MLP, attention matrices and hidden states are unit norm normalized. The input stream of tokens travels on the surface of a hypersphere, with each layer contributing a displacement towards the target output predictions. These displacements are defined by the MLP and attention blocks, whose vector components also reside on the same hypersphere. Experiments show that nGPT learns much faster, reducing the number of training steps required to achieve the same accuracy by a factor of 4 to 20, depending on the sequence length.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REFUEL/, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI.

Abstract: Foundational Models are an emerging widely used technique of GenAI. These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.

Abstract: Extending Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation can enable the designer to make the most use of parallel computing technology. However, most of current batch approaches do not scale well with the batch size. That is, their performances deteriorate dramatically as the batch size increases. To address this issue, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to large-scale batch evaluation in this work. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of axis-aligned subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain axis-aligned subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for parallel evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can speedup the convergence significantly when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with seven batch Bayesian optimization algorithms. A Matlab implementation of the proposed approach is available at https://github.com/zhandawei/Expected_Subspace_Improvement_Batch_Bayesian_Optimization.

Abstract: This research aims to know traffic anomalies as early as possible. A traffic anomaly refers to a generic incident on the road that influences traffic flow and calls for urgent traffic management measures. `Knowing'' the occurrence of a traffic anomaly is twofold: the ability to detect this anomaly before it is reported anywhere, or it may be such that an anomaly can be predicted before it actually occurs on the road (e.g., non-recurrent traffic breakdown). In either way, the objective is to inform traffic operators of unreported incidents in real time and as early as possible. The key is to stay ahead of the curve. Time is of the essence.
  Conventional automatic incident detection (AID) methods often struggle with early detection due to their limited consideration of spatial effects and early-stage characteristics. Therefore, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows the model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that significantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of incidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the model to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident. Additionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, our method is highly scalable and generalizable, as it is fully automated with no manual selection of historical reports required, relies solely on widely available low-cost data, and requires no additional detectors. The experimental results across numerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to more effective and early anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms in high-dimensional settings are highly susceptible to the influence of even a small fraction of structured outliers, making robust optimization techniques essential. In particular, within the $\epsilon$-contamination model, where an adversary can inspect and replace up to an $\epsilon$-fraction of the samples, a fundamental open problem is determining the optimal rates for robust stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under such contamination. We develop novel algorithms that achieve minimax-optimal excess risk (up to logarithmic factors) under the $\epsilon$-contamination model. Our approach improves over existing algorithms, which are not only suboptimal but also require stringent assumptions, including Lipschitz continuity and smoothness of individual sample functions. By contrast, our optimal algorithms do not require these stringent assumptions, assuming only population-level smoothness of the loss. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to handle the case in which the covariance parameter is unknown, and can be extended to nonsmooth population risks via convolutional smoothing. We complement our algorithmic developments with a tight information-theoretic lower bound for robust SCO.

Abstract: What types of numeric representations emerge in neural systems? What would a satisfying answer to this question look like? In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based counting tasks through a variety of lenses. We seek to understand how well we can understand NNs through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs), where SAs are defined by precise, abstract, mutable variables used to perform computations. We use GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained using Next Token Prediction (NTP) on numeric tasks where the solutions to the tasks depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret NN's raw activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the neural activity in terms of interpretable subspaces rather than individual neurons. Depending on the analysis, however, these interpretations can be graded, existing on a continuum, highlighting the philosophical question of what it means to "interpret" neural activity, and motivating us to introduce Alignment Functions to add flexibility to the existing Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) method. Through our specific analyses we show the importance of causal interventions for NN interpretability; we show that recurrent models develop graded, symbol-like number variables within their neural activity; we introduce a generalization of DAS to frame NN activity in terms of linear functions of interpretable variables; and we show that Transformers must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that avoid using cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers. We use our results to encourage interpreting NNs at the level of neural subspaces through the lens of SAs.

Abstract: When can we say that two neural systems are the same? The answer to this question is goal-dependent, and it is often addressed through correlative methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We find ourselves chiefly interested in the relationship between representations and behavior, asking ourselves how we can isolate specific functional aspects of representational similarity to relate our measures to behavior -- avoiding cause vs. correlation pitfalls in the process. In this work, we introduce Model Alignment Search (MAS), a method for causally exploring distributed representational similarity as it relates to behavior. The method learns invertible linear transformations that find an aligned subspace between two distributed networks' representations where functional information can be isolated and manipulated. We first show that the method can be used to transfer values of specific causal variables -- such as the number of items in a counting task -- between networks with different training seeds and different architectures. We then explore open questions in number cognition by comparing different types of numeric representations in models trained on structurally different tasks, we explore differences between MAS and preexisting functional similarity methods, and lastly, we introduce a counterfactual latent auxiliary loss that helps shape functionally relevant alignments even in cases where we do not have causal access to one of the two models for training.

Abstract: Given multi-type point maps from different place-types (e.g., tumor regions), our objective is to develop a classifier trained on the source place-type to accurately distinguish between two classes of the target place-type based on their point arrangements. This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.

Abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their generation. While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; yet, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98\% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68\% poisoning text) on various GraphRAG-based systems. We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.

Abstract: The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to bridge the gap between an ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability.

Abstract: Task vectors, which are derived from the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned model weights, enable flexible task adaptation and model merging through arithmetic operations such as addition and negation. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics with limited theoretical support, often leading to performance gaps comparing to direct task fine tuning. Meanwhile, although it is easy to manipulate saved task vectors with arithmetic for different purposes, such compositional flexibility demands high memory usage, especially when dealing with a huge number of tasks, limiting scalability. This work addresses these issues with a theoretically grounded framework that explains task vector arithmetic and introduces the task vector bases framework. Building upon existing task arithmetic literature, our method significantly reduces the memory cost for downstream arithmetic with little effort, while achieving competitive performance and maintaining compositional advantage, providing a practical solution for large-scale task arithmetic. The code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/TaskVectorBasis.

Abstract: We consider linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithms driven by martingale noise. Recent applications in machine learning motivate the need to understand finite-time error rates, but conventional stochastic approximation analysis focus on either asymptotic convergence in distribution or finite-time bounds that are far from optimal. Prior work on asymptotic central limit theorems (CLTs) suggest that two-time-scale algorithms may be able to achieve $1/\sqrt{n}$ error in expectation, with a constant given by the expected norm of the limiting Gaussian vector. However, the best known finite-time rates are much slower. We derive the first non-asymptotic central limit theorem with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance for two-time-scale stochastic approximation with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. As a corollary, we show that expected error achieved by Polyak-Ruppert averaging decays at rate $1/\sqrt{n}$, which significantly improves on the rates of convergence in prior works.

Abstract: The massive increase in the data volume and dataset availability for analysts compels researchers to focus on data content and select high-quality datasets to enhance the performance of analytics operators. While selecting the highest quality data for analysis highly increases task accuracy and efficiency, it is still a hard task, especially when the number of available inputs is very large. To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from datasets similar to the queried one. Dataset similarity is performed via projecting each dataset to a vector embedding representation. The vectorization process is performed using our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, which takes a whole dataset and projects it into a lower vector embedding representation space. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately. Furthermore, our vectorization model can project different real-world scenarios to a lower vector embedding representation and distinguish between them.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning systems has raised critical concerns about fairness and bias, making mitigating harmful biases essential for AI development. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between debiasing and removing artifacts in neural networks for computer vision tasks. First, we introduce a set of novel XAI-based metrics that analyze saliency maps to assess shifts in a model's decision-making process. Then, we demonstrate that successful debiasing methods systematically redirect model focus away from protected attributes. Finally, we show that techniques originally developed for artifact removal can be effectively repurposed for improving fairness. These findings provide evidence for the existence of a bidirectional connection between ensuring fairness and removing artifacts corresponding to protected attributes.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in jointly processing visual and textual data. However, they often incur substantial computational overhead due to redundant visual information, particularly in long-form video scenarios. Existing approaches predominantly focus on either vision token pruning, which may overlook spatio-temporal dependencies, or keyframe selection, which identifies informative frames but discards others, thus disrupting contextual continuity. In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance. These results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in efficient long-video processing, facilitating more scalable VLM deployment.

Abstract: The challenge of noisy multi-objective optimization lies in the constant trade-off between exploring new decision points and improving the precision of known points through resampling. This decision should take into account both the variability of the objective functions and the current estimate of a point in relation to the Pareto front. Since the amount and distribution of noise are generally unknown, it is desirable for a decision function to be highly adaptive to the properties of the optimization problem. This paper presents a resampling decision function that incorporates the stochastic nature of the optimization problem by using bootstrapping and the probability of dominance. The distribution-free estimation of the probability of dominance is achieved using bootstrap estimates of the means. To make the procedure applicable even with very few observations, we transfer the distribution observed at other decision points. The efficiency of this resampling approach is demonstrated by applying it in the NSGA-II algorithm with a sequential resampling procedure under multiple noise variations.

Abstract: This paper develops a model-based framework for continuous-time policy evaluation (CTPE) in reinforcement learning, incorporating both Brownian and L\'evy noise to model stochastic dynamics influenced by rare and extreme events. Our approach formulates the policy evaluation problem as solving a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) for the value function with unknown coefficients. A key challenge in this setting is accurately recovering the unknown coefficients in the stochastic dynamics, particularly when driven by L\'evy processes with heavy tail effects. To address this, we propose a robust numerical approach that effectively handles both unbiased and censored trajectory datasets. This method combines maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative tail correction mechanism, improving the stability and accuracy of coefficient recovery. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound for the policy evaluation error based on coefficient recovery error. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in recovering heavy-tailed L\'evy dynamics and verify the theoretical error analysis in policy evaluation.

Abstract: We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.

Abstract: It often happens that some sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers or passwords, are mistakenly incorporated in the training of machine learning models and need to be removed afterwards. The removal of such information from a trained model is a complex task that needs to partially reverse the training process. There have been various machine unlearning techniques proposed in the literature to address this problem. Most of the proposed methods revolve around removing individual data samples from a trained model. Another less explored direction is when features/labels of a group of data samples need to be reverted. While the existing methods for these tasks do the unlearning task by updating the whole set of model parameters or only the last layer of the model, we show that there are a subset of model parameters that have the largest contribution in the unlearning target features. More precisely, the model parameters with the largest corresponding diagonal value in the Hessian matrix (computed at the learned model parameter) have the most contribution in the unlearning task. By selecting these parameters and updating them during the unlearning stage, we can have the most progress in unlearning. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed strategy by connecting it to sharpness-aware minimization and robust unlearning. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving the efficacy of unlearning with a low computational cost.

Abstract: One global model in federated learning (FL) might not be sufficient to serve many clients with non-IID tasks and distributions. While there has been advances in FL to train multiple global models for better personalization, they only provide limited choices to clients so local finetuning is still indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can create a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models with automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global models can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the merging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server broadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs to send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of periodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global model, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data distribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds caused by client drift. We evaluate FedMerge on three different non-IID settings applied to different domains with diverse tasks and data types, in which FedMerge consistently outperforms existing FL approaches, including clustering-based and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods.

Abstract: The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.

Abstract: Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\times$.

Abstract: In data clustering, it is often desirable to find not just a single partition into clusters but a sequence of partitions that describes the data at different scales (or levels of coarseness). A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin such multiscale descriptions. Here, we use tools from topological data analysis and introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary cluster assignments in a sequence of partitions across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy of this sequence, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that, in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. Using synthetic data, we then illustrate how the persistence diagram of the MCF provides a feature map that can serve to characterise and classify multiscale clusterings.

Abstract: We present two neural network approaches that approximate the solutions of static and dynamic $\unicode{x1D450}\unicode{x1D45C}\unicode{x1D45B}\unicode{x1D451}\unicode{x1D456}\unicode{x1D461}\unicode{x1D456}\unicode{x1D45C}\unicode{x1D45B}\unicode{x1D44E}\unicode{x1D459}\unicode{x0020}\unicode{x1D45C}\unicode{x1D45D}\unicode{x1D461}\unicode{x1D456}\unicode{x1D45A}\unicode{x1D44E}\unicode{x1D459}\unicode{x0020}\unicode{x1D461}\unicode{x1D45F}\unicode{x1D44E}\unicode{x1D45B}\unicode{x1D460}\unicode{x1D45D}\unicode{x1D45C}\unicode{x1D45F}\unicode{x1D461}$ (COT) problems. Both approaches enable conditional sampling and conditional density estimation, which are core tasks in Bayesian inference$\unicode{x2013}$particularly in the simulation-based ($\unicode{x201C}$likelihood-free$\unicode{x201D}$) setting. Our methods represent the target conditional distribution as a transformation of a tractable reference distribution. Obtaining such a transformation, chosen here to be an approximation of the COT map, is computationally challenging even in moderate dimensions. To improve scalability, our numerical algorithms use neural networks to parameterize candidate maps and further exploit the structure of the COT problem. Our static approach approximates the map as the gradient of a partially input-convex neural network. It uses a novel numerical implementation to increase computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. Our dynamic approach approximates the conditional optimal transport via the flow map of a regularized neural ODE; compared to the static approach, it is slower to train but offers more modeling choices and can lead to faster sampling. We demonstrate both algorithms numerically, comparing them with competing state-of-the-art approaches, using benchmark datasets and simulation-based Bayesian inverse problems.

Abstract: Visible (VIS) imagery is important for monitoring Tropical Cyclones (TCs) but is unavailable at night. This study presents a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) model to generate nighttime VIS imagery with significantly enhanced accuracy and spatial resolution. Our method offers three key improvements compared to existing models. First, we replaced the L1 loss in the pix2pix framework with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, which significantly reduced image blurriness. Second, we selected multispectral infrared (IR) bands as input based on a thorough examination of their spectral properties, providing essential physical information for accurate simulation. Third, we incorporated the direction parameters of the sun and the satellite, which addressed the dependence of VIS images on sunlight directions and enabled a much larger training set from continuous daytime data. The model was trained and validated using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime, achieving statistical results of SSIM = 0.923 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.0299, which significantly surpasses existing models. We also performed a cross-satellite nighttime model validation using the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which yields outstanding results compared to existing models. Our model is operationally applied to generate accurate VIS imagery with arbitrary virtual sunlight directions, significantly contributing to the nighttime monitoring of various meteorological phenomena.

Abstract: Given multi-category point sets from different place-types, our goal is to develop a spatially-lucid classifier that can distinguish between two classes based on the arrangements of their points. This problem is important for many applications, such as oncology, for analyzing immune-tumor relationships and designing new immunotherapies. It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches. We explore a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly uses different training strategies, including weighted-distance learning rate and spatial domain adaptation, on various place-types for spatially-lucid classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., MxIF oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in deep learning is crucial for safe and reliable decision-making in downstream tasks. Existing methods quantify uncertainty at the last layer or other approximations of the network which may miss some sources of uncertainty in the model. To address this gap, we propose an uncertainty quantification method for large networks based on variation due to regularization. Essentially, predictions that are more (less) sensitive to the regularization of network parameters are less (more, respectively) certain. This principle can be implemented by deterministically tweaking the training loss during the fine-tuning phase and reflects confidence in the output as a function of all layers of the network. We show that regularization variation (RegVar) provides rigorous uncertainty estimates that, in the infinitesimal limit, exactly recover the Laplace approximation in Bayesian deep learning. We demonstrate its success in several deep learning architectures, showing it can scale tractably with the network size while maintaining or improving uncertainty quantification quality. Our experiments across multiple datasets show that RegVar not only identifies uncertain predictions effectively but also provides insights into the stability of learned representations.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and early detection through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has shown significant promise in reducing death rates. With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging, the development and evaluation of robust AI models require access to large, well-annotated datasets. In this study, we introduce the utility of Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) Dataset, the largest open-access LDCT dataset with over 2,000 scans and 3,000 expert-verified nodules. We benchmark deep learning models for both 3D nodule detection and lung cancer classification across internal and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D+. For detection, we develop two MONAI-based RetinaNet models (DLCSDmD and LUNA16-mD), evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For classification, we compare five models, including state-of-the-art pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a selfsupervised foundation model (FMCB), a randomly initialized ResNet50, and proposed a novel Strategic Warm-Start++ (SWS++) model. SWS++ uses curated candidate patches to pretrain a classification backbone within the same detection pipeline, enabling task-relevant feature learning. Our models demonstrated strong generalizability, with SWS++ achieving comparable or superior performance to existing foundational models across multiple datasets (AUC: 0.71 to 0.90). All code, models, and data are publicly released to promote reproducibility and collaboration. This work establishes a standardized benchmarking resource for lung cancer AI research, supporting future efforts in model development, validation, and clinical translation.

Abstract: Traffic pattern prediction has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently managing and mitigating the impacts of event-driven bursty traffic in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. However, achieving accurate predictions of bursty traffic remains a non-trivial task due to the inherent randomness of events, and these challenges intensify within live network environments. Consequently, there is a compelling imperative to design a lightweight and agile framework capable of assimilating continuously collected data from the network and accurately forecasting bursty traffic in mMTC networks. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a machine learning-based framework tailored for forecasting bursty traffic in multi-channel slotted ALOHA networks. The proposed machine learning network comprises long-term short-term memory (LSTM) and a DenseNet with feed-forward neural network (FFNN) layers, where the residual connections enhance the training ability of the machine learning network in capturing complicated patterns. Furthermore, we develop a new low-complexity online prediction algorithm that updates the states of the LSTM network by leveraging frequently collected data from the mMTC network. Simulation results and complexity analysis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of both accuracy and complexity, making it well-suited for time-critical live scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in a network with a single base station and thousands of devices organized into groups with distinct traffic-generating characteristics. Comprehensive evaluations and simulations indicate that our proposed machine learning approach achieves a remarkable $52\%$ higher accuracy in long-term predictions compared to traditional methods, without imposing additional processing load on the system.

Abstract: Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based \textit{attention} initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.

Abstract: Images captured under low-light scenarios often suffer from low quality. Previous CNN-based deep learning methods often involve using Retinex theory. Nevertheless, most of them cannot perform well in more complicated datasets like LOL-v2 while consuming too much computational resources. Besides, some of these methods require sophisticated training at different stages, making the procedure even more time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we propose a more accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND. RSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and reflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map and performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced gray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the reflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it obtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and Excitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly outperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from 0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based models in the LOL-v2-real dataset.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF .

Abstract: The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\,\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context. The code is available at https://github.com/corne00/DDU-Net.

Abstract: Sequential multiple-instance learning involves learning representations of sets distributed across discrete timesteps. In many real-world applications, modeling both the internal structure of sets and their temporal relationships across time is essential for capturing complex underlying patterns. However, existing methods either focus on learning set representations at a static level, ignoring temporal dynamics, or treat sequences as ordered lists of individual elements, lacking explicit mechanisms to represent sets. In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. We will release both the dataset and model implementations on GitHub.

<title>A causal viewpoint on prediction model performance under changes in case-mix: discrimination and calibration respond differently for prognosis and diagnosis predictions</title>

Abstract: Prediction models need reliable predictive performance as they inform clinical decisions, aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning. The predictive performance of these models is typically assessed through discrimination and calibration. Changes in the distribution of the data impact model performance and there may be important changes between a model's current application and when and where its performance was last evaluated. In health-care, a typical change is a shift in case-mix. For example, for cardiovascular risk management, a general practitioner sees a different mix of patients than a specialist in a tertiary hospital.
  This work introduces a novel framework that differentiates the effects of case-mix shifts on discrimination and calibration based on the causal direction of the prediction task. When prediction is in the causal direction (often the case for prognosis predictions), calibration remains stable under case-mix shifts, while discrimination does not. Conversely, when predicting in the anti-causal direction (often with diagnosis predictions), discrimination remains stable, but calibration does not.
  A simulation study and empirical validation using cardiovascular disease prediction models demonstrate the implications of this framework. The causal case-mix framework provides insights for developing, evaluating and deploying prediction models across different clinical settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding the causal structure of the prediction task.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.

Abstract: One of the growing trends in machine learning is the use of data generation techniques, since the performance of machine learning models is dependent on the quantity of the training dataset. However, in many real-world applications, particularly in medical and low-resource domains, collecting large datasets is challenging due to resource constraints, which leads to overfitting and poor generalization. This study introduces FICAug, a novel feature-to-image data augmentation framework designed to improve model generalization under limited data conditions by generating structured synthetic samples.
  FICAug first operates in the feature space, where original data are clustered using the k-means algorithm. Within pure-label clusters, synthetic data are generated through Gaussian sampling to increase diversity while maintaining label consistency. These synthetic features are then projected back into the image domain using a generative neural network, and a convolutional neural network is trained on the reconstructed images to learn enhanced representations.
  Experimental results demonstrate that FICAug significantly improves classification accuracy. In feature space, it achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 84.09%, while training a ResNet-18 model on the reconstructed images further boosted performance to 88.63%, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in extracting new and task-relevant features.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are powerful state-of-the-art methods used to generate synthetic data from high-dimensional data distributions and are widely used for image, audio, and video generation as well as many more applications in science and beyond. The \textit{manifold hypothesis} states that high-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds within the ambient space, and is widely believed to hold in provided examples. While recent results have provided invaluable insight into how diffusion models adapt to the manifold hypothesis, they do not capture the great empirical success of these models, making this a very fruitful research direction.
  In this work, we study DDPMs under the manifold hypothesis and prove that they achieve rates independent of the ambient dimension in terms of score learning. In terms of sampling complexity, we obtain rates independent of the ambient dimension w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $O(\sqrt{D})$ w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. We do this by developing a new framework connecting diffusion models to the well-studied theory of extrema of Gaussian Processes.

Abstract: Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention consistently improves language modeling and downstream task performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform language modeling equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.

Abstract: Score-matching generative models have proven successful at sampling from complex high-dimensional data distributions. In many applications, this distribution is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$. The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in order to converge in Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$. Moreover, we show that this linear dependency is sharp.

Abstract: Dynamical systems form the foundation of scientific discovery, traditionally modeled with predefined state variables such as the angle and angular velocity, and differential equations such as the equation of motion for a single pendulum. We introduce a framework that automatically discovers a low-dimensional and operable representation of system dynamics, including a set of compact state variables that preserve the smoothness of the system dynamics and a differentiable vector field, directly from video without requiring prior domain-specific knowledge. The prominence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative analyses of a range of dynamical systems, including the identification of stable equilibria, the prediction of natural frequencies, and the detection of of chaotic and limit cycle behaviors. The results highlight the potential of our data-driven approach to advance automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: The large models, as predicted by scaling raw forecasts, have made groundbreaking progress in many fields, particularly in natural language generation tasks, where they have approached or even surpassed human levels. However, the unprecedented scale of their parameters brings significant computational and storage costs. These large models require substantial computational resources and GPU memory to operate. When adapting large models to specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant challenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power and GPU memory. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the parameters of large pre-trained models to suit various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT adjusts the parameters of pre-trained large models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, minimizing the introduction of additional parameters and the computational resources required. This review mainly introduces the preliminary knowledge of PEFT, the core ideas and principles of various PEFT algorithms, the applications of PEFT, and potential future research directions. By reading this review, we believe that interested parties can quickly grasp the PEFT methodology, thereby accelerating its development and innovation.

Abstract: Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.

<title>Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Linkage-Based Clustering of Data Sequences</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data sequences generated from {\em unknown} distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.

Abstract: The forest serves as the most significant terrestrial carbon stock mechanism, effectively reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and mitigating climate change. Remote sensing provides high data accuracy and enables large-scale observations. Optical images facilitate long-term monitoring, which is crucial for future carbon stock estimation studies. This study focuses on Huize County, Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, utilizing GF-1 WFV satellite imagery. The KD-VGG and KD-UNet modules were introduced for initial feature extraction, and the improved implicit diffusion model (IIDM) was proposed. The results showed: (1) The VGG module improved initial feature extraction, improving accuracy, and reducing inference time with optimized model parameters. (2) The Cross-attention + MLPs module enabled effective feature fusion, establishing critical relationships between global and local features, achieving high-accuracy estimation. (3) The IIDM model, a novel contribution, demonstrated the highest estimation accuracy with an RMSE of 12.17%, significantly improving by 41.69% to 42.33% compared to the regression model. In carbon stock estimation, the generative model excelled in extracting deeper features, significantly outperforming other models, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-generated content in quantitative remote sensing. The 16-meter resolution estimates provide a robust basis for tailoring forest carbon sink regulations, enhancing regional carbon stock management.

Abstract: Automated assessment of surgical skills using artificial intelligence (AI) provides trainees with instantaneous feedback. After bimanual tool motions are captured, derived kinematic metrics are reliable predictors of performance in laparoscopic tasks. Implementing automated tool tracking requires time-intensive human annotation. We developed AI-based tool tracking using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to eliminate the need for human annotators. Here, we describe a study evaluating the usefulness of our tool tracking model in automated assessment during a laparoscopic suturing task in the fundoplication procedure. An automated tool tracking model was applied to recorded videos of Nissen fundoplication on porcine bowel. Surgeons were grouped as novices (PGY1-2) and experts (PGY3-5, attendings). The beginning and end of each suturing step were segmented, and motions of the left and right tools were extracted. A low-pass filter with a 24 Hz cut-off frequency removed noise. Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost. PCA was performed for feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) model with classifiers, such as a 1-D CNN and traditional models, was trained. Data were extracted for 28 participants (9 novices, 19 experts). Supervised learning with PCA and Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 0.795 and an F1 score of 0.778. The unsupervised 1-D CNN achieved superior results with an accuracy of 0.817 and an F1 score of 0.806, eliminating the need for kinematic feature computation. We demonstrated an AI model capable of automated performance classification, independent of human annotation.

Abstract: Although deep reinforcement learning has been shown to be effective, the model's black-box nature presents barriers to direct policy interpretation. To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.

Abstract: Model uncertainty quantification involves measuring and evaluating the uncertainty linked to a model's predictions, helping assess their reliability and confidence. Noise injection is a technique used to enhance the robustness of neural networks by introducing randomness. In this paper, we establish a connection between noise injection and uncertainty quantification from a Bayesian standpoint. We theoretically demonstrate that injecting noise into the weights of a neural network is equivalent to Bayesian inference on a deep Gaussian process. Consequently, we introduce a Monte Carlo Noise Injection (MCNI) method, which involves injecting noise into the parameters during training and performing multiple forward propagations during inference to estimate the uncertainty of the prediction. Through simulation and experiments on regression and classification tasks, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the baseline model.

Abstract: The attribution of the author of an art piece is typically a laborious manual process, usually relying on subjective evaluations of expert figures. However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.

<title>Are Transformers Able to Reason by Connecting Separated Knowledge in Training Data?</title>

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used to produce predictions that serve as input data in subsequent statistical analyses. For example, computer vision predictions of economic and environmental indicators based on satellite imagery are used in downstream regressions; similarly, language models are widely used to approximate human ratings and opinions in social science research. However, failure to properly account for errors in the machine learning predictions renders standard statistical procedures invalid. Prior work uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid confidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables, assuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the scope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the complete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample and to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly, the method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional calculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no assumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than the intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions.

Abstract: In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.

Abstract: Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\sim$100B parameters). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.

Abstract: In the current insurance literature, prediction of insurance claims in the regression problem is often performed with a statistical model. This model-based approach may potentially suffer from several drawbacks: (i) model misspecification, (ii) selection effect, and (iii) lack of finite-sample validity. This article addresses these three issues simultaneously by employing conformal prediction -- a general machine learning strategy for valid predictions. The proposed method is both model-free and tuning-parameter-free. It also guarantees finite-sample validity at a pre-assigned coverage probability level. Examples, based on both simulated and real data, are provided to demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method and its applications in insurance, especially regarding meeting the solvency capital requirement of European insurance regulation, Solvency II.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have driven major breakthroughs in robotics by employing techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM-based multimodal perception and decision-making. However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.

<title>HyperDAS: Towards Automating Mechanistic Interpretability with Hypernetworks</title>

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has made great strides in identifying neural network features (e.g., directions in hidden activation space) that mediate concepts(e.g., the birth year of a person) and enable predictable manipulation. Distributed alignment search (DAS) leverages supervision from counterfactual data to learn concept features within hidden states, but DAS assumes we can afford to conduct a brute force search over potential feature locations. To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.

Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.

<title>Shared Global and Local Geometry of Language Model Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Researchers have recently suggested that models share common representations. In our work, we find that token embeddings of language models exhibit common geometric structure. First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. Our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability. Namely, we introduce Emb2Emb, a simple method to transfer steering vectors from one language model to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.

Abstract: Despite significant recent advances in probabilistic meta-learning, it is common for practitioners to avoid using deep learning models due to a comparative lack of interpretability. Instead, many practitioners simply use non-meta-models such as Gaussian processes with interpretable priors, and conduct the tedious procedure of training their model from scratch for each task they encounter. While this is justifiable for tasks with a limited number of data points, the cubic computational cost of exact Gaussian process inference renders this prohibitive when each task has many observations. To remedy this, we introduce a family of models that meta-learn sparse Gaussian process inference. Not only does this enable rapid prediction on new tasks with sparse Gaussian processes, but since our models have clear interpretations as members of the neural process family, it also allows manual elicitation of priors in a neural process for the first time. In meta-learning regimes for which the number of observed tasks is small or for which expert domain knowledge is available, this offers a crucial advantage.

Abstract: Over the past ten years, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in engineering domains has gained significant popularity, showcasing their potential in data-driven contexts. However, the complexity and diversity of engineering problems often require the development of domain-specific AI approaches, which are frequently hindered by a lack of systematic methodologies, scalability, and robustness during the development process. To address this gap, this paper introduces the "ABCDE" as the key elements of Engineering AI and proposes a unified, systematic engineering AI ecosystem framework, including eight essential layers, along with attributes, goals, and applications, to guide the development and deployment of AI solutions for specific engineering needs. Additionally, key challenges are examined, and eight future research directions are highlighted. By providing a comprehensive perspective, this paper aims to advance the strategic implementation of AI, fostering the development of next-generation engineering AI solutions.

<title>Dexterous Manipulation through Imitation Learning: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation, which refers to the ability of a robotic hand or multi-fingered end-effector to skillfully control, reorient, and manipulate objects through precise, coordinated finger movements and adaptive force modulation, enables complex interactions similar to human hand dexterity. With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation. Our goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a comprehensive introduction to this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Halide perovskites exhibit unpredictable properties in response to environmental stressors, due to several composition-dependent degradation mechanisms. In this work, we apply data visualization and machine learning (ML) techniques to reveal unexpected correlations between composition, temperature, and material properties while using high throughput, in situ environmental photoluminescence (PL) experiments. Correlation heatmaps show the strong influence of Cs content on film degradation, and dimensionality reduction visualization methods uncover clear composition-based data clusters. An extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) effectively forecasts PL features for ten perovskite films with both composition-agnostic (>85% accuracy) and composition-dependent (>75% accuracy) model approaches, while elucidating the relative feature importance of composition (up to 99%). This model validates a previously unseen anti-correlation between Cs content and material thermal stability. Our ML-based framework can be expanded to any perovskite family, significantly reducing the analysis time currently employed to identify stable options for photovoltaics.

Abstract: As demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents rapidly grows, optimizing systems for efficient LLM inference becomes critical. While significant efforts have focused on system-level engineering, little is explored from a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective.
  In this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for large language model (LLM) inference, bridging the gap between the queueing theory and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for individual inference LLM engine, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. In a network of LLM agents, work-conserving scheduling alone is insufficient, particularly when facing specific workload structures and multi-class workflows that require more sophisticated scheduling strategies. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FasterTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution. Our results highlight the substantial benefits that the queueing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary development.

<title>Artifact detection and localization in single-channel mobile EEG for sleep research using deep learning and attention mechanisms</title>

arXiv:2504.08469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artifacts in the electroencephalogram (EEG) degrade signal quality and impact the analysis of brain activity. Current methods for detecting artifacts in sleep EEG rely on simple threshold-based algorithms that require manual intervention, which is time-consuming and impractical due to the vast volume of data that novel mobile recording systems generate. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model incorporating a convolutional block attention module (CNN-CBAM) to detect and identify the location of artifacts in the sleep EEG with attention maps. We benchmarked this model against six other machine learning and signal processing approaches. We trained/tuned all models on 72 manually annotated EEG recordings obtained during home-based monitoring from 18 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.05 y ($\pm$5.02). We tested them on 26 separate recordings from 6 healthy participants with a mean (SD) age of 68.33 y ($\pm$4.08), with contained artifacts in 4\% of epochs. CNN-CBAM achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88), sensitivity (0.81), and specificity (0.86) when compared to the other approaches. The attention maps from CNN-CBAM localized artifacts within the epoch with a sensitivity of 0.71 and specificity of 0.67. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automating the detection and localization of artifacts in wearable sleep EEG.

Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging method with diverse applications, including medical imaging and non-destructive testing. The inverse problem of reconstructing internal electrical conductivity from boundary measurements is nonlinear and highly ill-posed, making it difficult to solve accurately. In recent years, there has been growing interest in combining analytical methods with machine learning to solve inverse problems. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating the convex hull of inclusions from boundary measurements by combining the enclosure method proposed by Ikehata with neural networks. We demonstrate its performance using experimental data. Compared to the classical enclosure method with least squares fitting, the learned convex hull achieves superior performance on both simulated and experimental data.

Summary:
Tabular data, organized as rows and columns, is prevalent in machine learning applications. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promising results in learning from tabular data due to their representation learning capabilities. This survey introduces tabular representation learning, discussing the challenges, benchmarks, and the use of DNNs. Methods are categorized into specialized, transferable, and general models based on their generalization capabilities. Specialized models focus on tasks within the same data distribution, while transferable models are pre-trained on datasets and fine-tuned on downstream tasks. General models, or tabular foundation models, can be directly applied to tasks without fine-tuning. Ensemble methods and extensions to tabular learning are also explored. The survey provides a detailed taxonomy of specialized models and strategies for obtaining high-quality representations at feature- and sample-level.

Abstract: Tabular data, structured as rows and columns, is among the most prevalent data types in machine learning classification and regression applications. Models for learning from tabular data have continuously evolved, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) recently demonstrating promising results through their capability of representation learning. In this survey, we systematically introduce the field of tabular representation learning, covering the background, challenges, and benchmarks, along with the pros and cons of using DNNs. We organize existing methods into three main categories according to their generalization capabilities: specialized, transferable, and general models. Specialized models focus on tasks where training and evaluation occur within the same data distribution. We introduce a hierarchical taxonomy for specialized models based on the key aspects of tabular data -- features, samples, and objectives -- and delve into detailed strategies for obtaining high-quality feature- and sample-level representations. Transferable models are pre-trained on one or more datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on downstream tasks, leveraging knowledge acquired from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, or even cross-modalities such as vision and language. General models, also known as tabular foundation models, extend this concept further, allowing direct application to downstream tasks without fine-tuning. We group these general models based on the strategies used to adapt across heterogeneous datasets. Additionally, we explore ensemble methods, which integrate the strengths of multiple tabular models. Finally, we discuss representative extensions of tabular learning, including open-environment tabular machine learning, multimodal learning with tabular data, and tabular understanding.

Summary: <br />
SparseJEPA is proposed as an extension to JEPA models, integrating sparse representation learning to improve the quality of learned representations. By encouraging shared latent space variables among data features with strong semantic relationships, SparseJEPA maintains predictive performance while enhancing interpretability. Training on CIFAR-100 and pre-training a lightweight Vision Transformer show the effectiveness of SparseJEPA in image classification and low-level tasks through linear-probe transfer learning. The architecture's versatility across different transfer tasks is highlighted. The theoretical proof demonstrates that the grouping mechanism enhances representation quality by reducing Multiinformation among latent variables and upholding the Data Processing Inequality for Multiinformation. By incorporating sparsity, SparseJEPA not only refines the latent space but also facilitates the learning of more meaningful and interpretable representations, with the potential for further extension in object-centric representation learning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) have emerged as a powerful framework for learning general-purpose representations. However, these models often lack interpretability and suffer from inefficiencies due to dense embedding representations. We propose SparseJEPA, an extension that integrates sparse representation learning into the JEPA framework to enhance the quality of learned representations. SparseJEPA employs a penalty method that encourages latent space variables to be shared among data features with strong semantic relationships, while maintaining predictive performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseJEPA by training on the CIFAR-100 dataset and pre-training a lightweight Vision Transformer. The improved embeddings are utilized in linear-probe transfer learning for both image classification and low-level tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility across different transfer tasks. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical proof that demonstrates that the grouping mechanism enhances representation quality. This was done by displaying that grouping reduces Multiinformation among latent-variables, including proofing the Data Processing Inequality for Multiinformation. Our results indicate that incorporating sparsity not only refines the latent space but also facilitates the learning of more meaningful and interpretable representations. In further work, hope to further extend this method by finding new ways to leverage the grouping mechanism through object-centric representation learning.

Summary: 
This study reviews process-based models (PBMs), deep learning (DL) models, and hybrid PBM-DL frameworks in agricultural and environmental modelling. Hybrid models, combining the strengths of PBMs and DL, outperform traditional PBMs and DL models in predicting crop dry biomass, especially in noisy data and unseen locations.

Abstract: Process-based models (PBMs) and deep learning (DL) are two key approaches in agricultural modelling, each offering distinct advantages and limitations. PBMs provide mechanistic insights based on physical and biological principles, ensuring interpretability and scientific rigour. However, they often struggle with scalability, parameterisation, and adaptation to heterogeneous environments. In contrast, DL models excel at capturing complex, nonlinear patterns from large datasets but may suffer from limited interpretability, high computational demands, and overfitting in data-scarce scenarios.
  This study presents a systematic review of PBMs, DL models, and hybrid PBM-DL frameworks, highlighting their applications in agricultural and environmental modelling. We classify hybrid PBM-DL approaches into DL-informed PBMs, where neural networks refine process-based models, and PBM-informed DL, where physical constraints guide deep learning predictions. Additionally, we conduct a case study on crop dry biomass prediction, comparing hybrid models against standalone PBMs and DL models under varying data quality, sample sizes, and spatial conditions. The results demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform traditional PBMs and DL models, offering greater robustness to noisy data and improved generalisation across unseen locations.
  Finally, we discuss key challenges, including model interpretability, scalability, and data requirements, alongside actionable recommendations for advancing hybrid modelling in agriculture. By integrating domain knowledge with AI-driven approaches, this study contributes to the development of scalable, interpretable, and reproducible agricultural models that support data-driven decision-making for sustainable agriculture.

<div> Keywords: Deep Learning, GPU optimization, Hexcute, Matrix Multiplication, Quantization

Summary:
Hexcute is a new tile-based programming language designed to optimize deep learning workloads running on GPUs, especially for operators with mixed input data types. This language aims to strike a balance between expressiveness and programming effort by providing fine-grained optimization capabilities through shared memory and register abstractions. Hexcute also utilizes task mapping to schedule GPU programs efficiently. A key feature of Hexcute is its automation of layout and task mapping synthesis using a type-inference-based algorithm, reducing the programming effort required. Evaluation results show that Hexcute outperforms existing deep learning compilers for mixed-type operators, achieving significant speedups ranging from 1.7 to 11.28 times. In end-to-end evaluations, Hexcute brings up to 2.91 times speedup, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing deep learning workloads for GPUs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.

<div> phonemes, multilingual, speech-to-speech translation, sequence-to-sequence model, BLEU metric

Summary:<br /><br />This paper presents a novel approach using phonemes as a textual representation in multilingual speech-to-speech translation. Two models were trained on the WMT17 dataset, one using standard text representation and the other using phonemic representation. Evaluation using the BLEU metric showed that the phonemic approach achieved comparable quality to the traditional text-based approach while offering advantages such as lower resource requirements and better suitability for low-resource languages. This new method opens up possibilities for more efficient and effective multilingual translation systems, particularly in scenarios where resources are limited or languages are less commonly spoken. <div>

To investigate this, we trained an open-source sequence-to-sequence model on the WMT17 dataset in two formats: one using standard textual representation and the other employing phonemic representation. The performance of both approaches was assessed using the BLEU metric. Our findings shows that the phonemic approach provides comparable quality but offers several advantages, including lower resource requirements or better suitability for low-resource languages.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel framework for fairness adjustments in machine learning, catering to various tasks and fairness metrics. Unlike traditional approaches, this method decouples fairness adjustments from model training, preserving model performance while enhancing flexibility. It eliminates the need for custom loss functions and allows fairness tuning with different datasets. The framework can be used with black-box models and offers interpretable insights into fairness adjustments. Comparing it to Adversarial Debiasing, the framework shows comparable fairness/accuracy tradeoff on real-world datasets. <div>

Abstract: As machine learning increasingly influences critical domains such as credit underwriting, public policy, and talent acquisition, ensuring compliance with fairness constraints is both a legal and ethical imperative. This paper introduces a novel framework for fairness adjustments that applies to diverse machine learning tasks, including regression and classification, and accommodates a wide range of fairness metrics. Unlike traditional approaches categorized as pre-processing, in-processing, or post-processing, our method adapts in-processing techniques for use as a post-processing step. By decoupling fairness adjustments from the model training process, our framework preserves model performance on average while enabling greater flexibility in model development. Key advantages include eliminating the need for custom loss functions, enabling fairness tuning using different datasets, accommodating proprietary models as black-box systems, and providing interpretable insights into the fairness adjustments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing it to Adversarial Debiasing, showing that our framework achieves a comparable fairness/accuracy tradeoff on real-world datasets.

<div> Keywords: fairness, decision-making, debiasing, collaboration, negotiation

Summary:
FairPlay is a web-based software application designed to address the issue of fairness in decision-making by enabling multiple stakeholders to collaboratively debias datasets. By adopting a strategic interaction approach, FairPlay allows users to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable outcome without the need for a universally agreed-upon theory of fairness. Through user studies, it was demonstrated that users could reach a consensus within about five rounds of gameplay using FairPlay. This highlights the potential of the application in enhancing fairness in AI systems by providing a systematic negotiation process and the ability to modify and observe changes in real-time. FairPlay offers a solution to the challenge of balancing differing and mutually incompatible versions of fairness demanded by stakeholders, making it a valuable tool for promoting fairness in decision-making processes.

Abstract: The issue of fairness in decision-making is a critical one, especially given the variety of stakeholder demands for differing and mutually incompatible versions of fairness. Adopting a strategic interaction of perspectives provides an alternative to enforcing a singular standard of fairness. We present a web-based software application, FairPlay, that enables multiple stakeholders to debias datasets collaboratively. With FairPlay, users can negotiate and arrive at a mutually acceptable outcome without a universally agreed-upon theory of fairness. In the absence of such a tool, reaching a consensus would be highly challenging due to the lack of a systematic negotiation process and the inability to modify and observe changes. We have conducted user studies that demonstrate the success of FairPlay, as users could reach a consensus within about five rounds of gameplay, illustrating the application's potential for enhancing fairness in AI systems.

<div> Energy-based models, potential flows, Variational Potential Flow Bayes, generative modeling, Kullback-Leibler divergence

Summary:<br /><br />Energy-based models are powerful generative models but lack exploration of potential flows. Variational Potential Flow Bayes (VPFB) is proposed as a new framework that eliminates the need for implicit MCMC sampling, auxiliary networks, or cooperative training. VPFB learns an energy-parameterized potential flow through a flow-driven density homotopy matched to the data distribution. This formulation allows for robust and efficient generative modeling while maintaining interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate VPFB's effectiveness in image generation, interpolation, out-of-distribution detection, and compositional generation, showing competitive performance in sample quality and versatility across various generative modeling tasks. <div>

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) are a powerful class of probabilistic generative models due to their flexibility and interpretability. However, relationships between potential flows and explicit EBMs remain underexplored, while contrastive divergence training via implicit Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is often unstable and expensive in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose Variational Potential Flow Bayes (VPFB), a new energy-based generative framework that eliminates the need for implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on auxiliary networks or cooperative training. VPFB learns an energy-parameterized potential flow by constructing a flow-driven density homotopy that is matched to the data distribution through a variational loss minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the flow-driven and marginal homotopies. This principled formulation enables robust and efficient generative modeling while preserving the interpretability of EBMs. Experimental results on image generation, interpolation, out-of-distribution detection, and compositional generation confirm the effectiveness of VPFB, showing that our method performs competitively with existing approaches in terms of sample quality and versatility across diverse generative modeling tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a performance benchmarking study of a Gradient-Optimized Fuzzy Inference System (GF) classifier against several state-of-the-art machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. The evaluation was conducted across five datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, each chosen for their diversity in input types, class distributions, and classification complexity. Unlike traditional Fuzzy Inference Systems that rely on derivative-free optimization methods, the GF leverages gradient descent to significantly improving training efficiency and predictive performance. Results demonstrate that the GF model achieved competitive, and in several cases superior, classification accuracy while maintaining high precision and exceptionally low training times. In particular, the GF exhibited strong consistency across folds and datasets, underscoring its robustness in handling noisy data and variable feature sets. These findings support the potential of gradient optimized fuzzy systems as interpretable, efficient, and adaptable alternatives to more complex deep learning models in supervised learning tasks.

Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) is introduced as a data transformation framework to improve the performance of traditional classification algorithms by generating synthetic opposite samples. Three OBL variants - Global OBL, Class-Wise OBL, and Localized Class-Wise OBL - are explored and integrated with popular classifiers such as KNN, SVM, LR, and DT.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel data transformation framework based on Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) to boost the performance of traditional classification algorithms. Originally developed to accelerate convergence in optimization tasks, OBL is leveraged here to generate synthetic opposite samples that replace the acutely training data and improve decision boundary formation. We explore three OBL variants; Global OBL, Class-Wise OBL, and Localized Class-Wise OBL; and integrate them with several widely used classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT). Extensive experiments conducted on 26 heterogeneous and high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that OBL-enhanced classifiers consistently outperform their standard counterparts in terms of accuracy and F1-score, frequently achieving near-perfect or perfect classification. Furthermore, OBL contributes to improved computational efficiency, particularly in SVM and LR. These findings underscore the potential of OBL as a lightweight yet powerful data transformation strategy for enhancing classification performance, especially in complex or sparse learning environments.

arXiv:2504.16272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipelines for large language model (LLM) alignment typically assign scalar rewards to sequences, using the final token as a surrogate indicator for the quality of the entire sequence. However, this leads to sparse feedback and suboptimal token-level credit assignment. In this work, we frame reward shaping as an optimization problem focused on token-level credit assignment. We propose a reward-shaping function leveraging explainability methods such as SHAP and LIME to estimate per-token rewards from the reward model. To learn parameters of this shaping function, we employ a bilevel optimization framework that integrates Bayesian Optimization and policy training to handle noise from the token reward estimates. Our experiments show that achieving a better balance of token-level reward attribution leads to performance improvements over baselines on downstream tasks and finds an optimal policy faster during training. Furthermore, we show theoretically that explainability methods that are feature additive attribution functions maintain the optimal policy as the original reward.

<div> Keywords: Transformer, Softmax, attention matrix, doubly stochastic matrix, quantum circuit

Summary: 
A new study introduces a hybrid classical-quantum Transformer called QDSFormer, which replaces the Softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the recent discovery that doubly stochastic matrices (DSMs) can be obtained using parametric quantum circuits, providing a unique quantum inductive bias. The QDSFormer demonstrates superior performance compared to standard Vision Transformers and other doubly stochastic Transformers across small-scale object recognition tasks. The quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer, based on QR decomposition, is also compared. The QDSFormer exhibits improved training stability and reduced performance variation, suggesting it may help alleviate the training instability commonly observed in Vision Transformers on small-scale datasets. <div>
arXiv:2504.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the core of the Transformer, the Softmax normalizes the attention matrix to be right stochastic. Previous research has shown that this often destabilizes training and that enforcing the attention matrix to be doubly stochastic (through Sinkhorn's algorithm) consistently improves performance across different tasks, domains and Transformer flavors. However, Sinkhorn's algorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible w.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been proven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a novel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum doubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the expressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that better preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple small-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently surpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic Transformers. Beyond the established Sinkformer, this comparison includes a novel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR decomposition) that can be of independent interest. The QDSFormer also shows improved training stability and lower performance variation suggesting that it may mitigate the notoriously unstable training of ViTs on small-scale data.

<div> Rare species, bird call classification, automated pipeline, conservation monitoring, endangered birds
<br />
The paper introduces an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline tailored for rare bird species not covered by existing large classifiers. These classifiers are proficient in detecting common birds but lack the capability to identify species with limited recordings, crucial for conservation efforts monitoring endangered birds. By utilizing embedding spaces of large bird classification networks and employing cosine similarity, filtering, and denoising techniques, the pipeline optimizes detection with minimal training data. Evaluation of various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validation on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving perfect recall and high accuracy in detecting the bird's calls. This open-source system serves as a practical tool for conservationists to detect and monitor rare species facing extinction.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline designed for rare species absent from large publicly available classifiers like BirdNET and Perch. While these models excel at detecting common birds with abundant training data, they lack options for species with only 1-3 known recordings-a critical limitation for conservationists monitoring the last remaining individuals of endangered birds. To address this, we leverage the embedding space of large bird classification networks and develop a classifier using cosine similarity, combined with filtering and denoising preprocessing techniques, to optimize detection with minimal training data. We evaluate various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validate our approach in both a simulated scenario with Xeno-Canto recordings and a real-world test on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris), which has no existing classifiers and only three confirmed recordings. The final model achieved 1.0 recall and 0.95 accuracy in detecting tooth-billed pigeon calls, making it practical for use in the field. This open-source system provides a practical tool for conservationists seeking to detect and monitor rare species on the brink of extinction.

Summary:
The article introduces the Dataset Subset Selection for Specialization (DS3) problem, focusing on the need for selecting specialized subsets from training data to optimize model performance on deployment-specific distributions. The DataS^3 benchmark is introduced to evaluate algorithms for DS3 across diverse real-world application domains. Results show that general-distribution methods often fail on deployment-specific tasks, emphasizing the importance of tailored dataset curation. Expert subsets curated for specific deployments outperform training on all available data, showcasing accuracy gains of up to 51.3 percent. The study highlights the critical role of dataset curation in enhancing model performance and training efficiency on deployment-specific distributions. This becomes particularly important as global datasets become more available and machine learning models are deployed in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world machine learning (ML) applications (e.g. detecting broken bones in x-ray images, detecting species in camera traps), in practice models need to perform well on specific deployments (e.g. a specific hospital, a specific national park) rather than the domain broadly. However, deployments often have imbalanced, unique data distributions. Discrepancy between the training distribution and the deployment distribution can lead to suboptimal performance, highlighting the need to select deployment-specialized subsets from the available training data. We formalize dataset subset selection for specialization (DS3): given a training set drawn from a general distribution and a (potentially unlabeled) query set drawn from the desired deployment-specific distribution, the goal is to select a subset of the training data that optimizes deployment performance.
  We introduce DataS^3; the first dataset and benchmark designed specifically for the DS3 problem. DataS^3 encompasses diverse real-world application domains, each with a set of distinct deployments to specialize in. We conduct a comprehensive study evaluating algorithms from various families--including coresets, data filtering, and data curation--on DataS^3, and find that general-distribution methods consistently fail on deployment-specific tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of manually curated (deployment-specific) expert subsets that outperform training on all available data with accuracy gains up to 51.3 percent. Our benchmark highlights the critical role of tailored dataset curation in enhancing performance and training efficiency on deployment-specific distributions, which we posit will only become more important as global, public datasets become available across domains and ML models are deployed in the real world.

<div> Keywords: atypical speech, affect recognition, speech models, robustness, emotion modeling 

Summary: 
The study evaluates the impact of speech atypicalities on affect recognition models, specifically focusing on intelligibility, monopitch, and harshness. The research compares the performance of existing affect recognition models on atypical speech datasets to those of typical speech. Results show that atypical speech significantly affects affect predictions, with a higher proportion of sadness predicted in atypical speech. Fine-tuning models on pseudo-labeled atypical speech data improves performance on atypical speech without affecting typical speech performance. The findings highlight the importance of broader training and evaluation datasets for speech emotion models and the need for robust modeling approaches that can accommodate voice and speech differences. This research underscores the necessity of addressing speech variations in affect recognition models for individuals with atypical speech patterns. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech and voice conditions can alter the acoustic properties of speech, which could impact the performance of paralinguistic models for affect for people with atypical speech. We evaluate publicly available models for recognizing categorical and dimensional affect from speech on a dataset of atypical speech, comparing results to datasets of typical speech. We investigate three dimensions of speech atypicality: intelligibility, which is related to pronounciation; monopitch, which is related to prosody, and harshness, which is related to voice quality. We look at (1) distributional trends of categorical affect predictions within the dataset, (2) distributional comparisons of categorical affect predictions to similar datasets of typical speech, and (3) correlation strengths between text and speech predictions for spontaneous speech for valence and arousal. We find that the output of affect models is significantly impacted by the presence and degree of speech atypicalities. For instance, the percentage of speech predicted as sad is significantly higher for all types and grades of atypical speech when compared to similar typical speech datasets. In a preliminary investigation on improving robustness for atypical speech, we find that fine-tuning models on pseudo-labeled atypical speech data improves performance on atypical speech without impacting performance on typical speech. Our results emphasize the need for broader training and evaluation datasets for speech emotion models, and for modeling approaches that are robust to voice and speech differences.

Abstract: Cosine similarity has become a standard metric for comparing embeddings in modern machine learning. Its scale-invariance and alignment with model training objectives have contributed to its widespread adoption. However, recent studies have revealed important limitations, particularly when embedding norms carry meaningful semantic information. This informal article offers a reflective and selective examination of the evolution, strengths, and limitations of cosine similarity. We highlight why it performs well in many settings, where it tends to break down, and how emerging alternatives are beginning to address its blind spots. We hope to offer a mix of conceptual clarity and practical perspective, especially for quantitative scientists who think about embeddings not just as vectors, but as geometric and philosophical objects.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Network (GOMKCN) as a novel approach for graph representation learning. GOMKCN views graphs as node-centric subgraphs, enabling the recognition of structural patterns within the data. By leveraging the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a convolutional operator, GOMKCN computes similarities between subgraphs and learnable graph filters. This allows for the disentanglement of representations and the adaptive capture of relevant structural patterns. GOMK addresses the trade-off between differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels by incorporating local correspondences in similarity measurement. Experimental results demonstrate that GOMKCN outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability, making significant advances in graph pattern mining and prediction. The framework lays the groundwork for further developments in disentangled graph representation learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graphs effectively characterize relational data, driving graph representation learning methods that uncover underlying predictive information. As state-of-the-art approaches, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable end-to-end learning for diverse tasks. Recent disentangled graph representation learning enhances interpretability by decoupling independent factors in graph data. However, existing methods often implicitly and coarsely characterize graph structures, limiting structural pattern analysis within the graph. This paper proposes the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel Convolutional Network (GOMKCN) to address this limitation. We view graphs as node-centric subgraphs, where each subgraph acts as a structural factor encoding position-specific information. This transforms graph prediction into structural pattern recognition. Inspired by CNNs, GOMKCN introduces the Graph Optimal Matching Kernel (GOMK) as a convolutional operator, computing similarities between subgraphs and learnable graph filters. Mathematically, GOMK maps subgraphs and filters into a Hilbert space, representing graphs as point sets. Disentangled representations emerge from projecting subgraphs onto task-optimized filters, which adaptively capture relevant structural patterns via gradient descent. Crucially, GOMK incorporates local correspondences in similarity measurement, resolving the trade-off between differentiability and accuracy in graph kernels. Experiments validate that GOMKCN achieves superior accuracy and interpretability in graph pattern mining and prediction. The framework advances the theoretical foundation for disentangled graph representation learning.

Summary:<br /><br />
The study focuses on non-stationary reinforcement learning in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting, where the variation budget of the Markov Decision Process is taken into account. Traditional algorithms for non-stationary RL concentrate on model-based and model-free value-based methods, while policy-based approaches are less explored. The proposed Non-Stationary Natural Actor-Critic (NS-NAC) algorithm is a model-free policy-based method that utilizes restart-based exploration for adaptability. Additionally, the BORL-NS-NAC algorithm is introduced as a parameter-free alternative without prior knowledge of the variation budget. Both algorithms exhibit a dynamic regret analysis with a complexity that scales with the sizes of the state and action spaces, the variation budget, and the time horizon. The study provides insights into the adaptation of policy and value function estimates in dynamic environments, offering a comprehensive understanding of non-stationary RL algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2504.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL) in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting. We model it by a Markov Decision Process with time-varying rewards and transition probabilities, with a variation budget of $\Delta_T$. Existing non-stationary RL algorithms focus on model-based and model-free value-based methods. Policy-based methods despite their flexibility in practice are not theoretically well understood in non-stationary RL. We propose and analyze the first model-free policy-based algorithm, Non-Stationary Natural Actor-Critic (NS-NAC), a policy gradient method with a restart based exploration for change and a novel interpretation of learning rates as adapting factors. Further, we present a bandit-over-RL based parameter-free algorithm BORL-NS-NAC that does not require prior knowledge of the variation budget $\Delta_T$. We present a dynamic regret of $\tilde{\mathscr O}(|S|^{1/2}|A|^{1/2}\Delta_T^{1/6}T^{5/6})$ for both algorithms, where $T$ is the time horizon, and $|S|$, $|A|$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces. The regret analysis leverages a novel adaptation of the Lyapunov function analysis of NAC to dynamic environments and characterizes the effects of simultaneous updates in policy, value function estimate and changes in the environment.

While existing methods are effective in convex settings, they struggle in large-scale non-convex settings, showing weak correlation with ground truth. MAGIC combines classical techniques with recent advancements in metadifferentiation to provide optimal estimates in non-convex scenarios. By leveraging metadifferentiation, MAGIC can effectively estimate how modifications in the training data influence model predictions, offering a significant improvement over current methods. The proposed method enhances the understanding of the impact of data manipulation on predictive models, contributing to more accurate predictions and model interpretation in complex, real-world scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The goal of predictive data attribution is to estimate how adding or removing a given set of training datapoints will affect model predictions. In convex settings, this goal is straightforward (i.e., via the infinitesimal jackknife). In large-scale (non-convex) settings, however, existing methods are far less successful -- current methods' estimates often only weakly correlate with ground truth. In this work, we present a new data attribution method (MAGIC) that combines classical methods and recent advances in metadifferentiation to (nearly) optimally estimate the effect of adding or removing training data on model predictions.

<div> Keywords: discrete diffusion, Target Concrete Score Matching, pre-training, fine-tuning, language modeling

Summary:
Discrete diffusion is a powerful framework for modeling and generating discrete data, and the Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM) objective enhances its training and fine-tuning capabilities. TCSM offers a versatile approach by estimating the concrete score of the target distribution in the clean data space. This enables seamless integration with reward functions and pre-trained models, enhancing sample efficiency and flexibility. TCSM supports pre-training directly from data samples and various post-training scenarios like fine-tuning with reward functions or distillation of knowledge from pre-trained autoregressive models. Experimental results on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM outperforms existing methods while offering greater adaptability and efficiency in both pre-training and post-training phases. The TCSM framework extends the capabilities of discrete diffusion models, making them more effective for a wide range of applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Discrete diffusion is a promising framework for modeling and generating discrete data. In this work, we present Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM), a novel and versatile objective for training and fine-tuning discrete diffusion models. TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports pre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many existing discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our more general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to post-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward functions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained autoregressive models. These new capabilities stem from the core idea of TCSM, estimating the concrete score of the target distribution, which resides in the original (clean) data space. This allows seamless integration with reward functions and pre-trained models, which inherently only operate in the clean data space rather than the noisy intermediate spaces of diffusion processes. Our experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM matches or surpasses current methods. Additionally, TCSM is versatile, applicable to both pre-training and post-training scenarios, offering greater flexibility and sample efficiency.

Abstract: As time evolves, data within specific domains exhibit predictability that motivates time series forecasting to predict future trends from historical data. However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising performance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and practical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies, prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting performance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.

<div> DP-FL, Federated Learning, DP synthetic data, LLMs, POPri<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new method called Preference Optimization for Private Client Data (POPri) that leverages private client feedback as preference rankings to generate high-quality DP synthetic data for Federated Learning (FL) applications. The algorithm utilizes preference optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune Language Model (LLMs) on federated client data. The authors release a new federated text benchmark called LargeFedBench for uncontaminated LLM evaluations, comparing POPri against existing benchmarks. Results show that POPri significantly enhances the utility of DP synthetic data, closing the accuracy gap between fully-private and non-private settings by up to 68%. This outperforms prior synthetic data methods by 16% and state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods by 58%. The code and data for POPri are publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical settings, differentially private Federated learning (DP-FL) is the dominant method for training models from private, on-device client data. Recent work has suggested that DP-FL may be enhanced or outperformed by methods that use DP synthetic data (Wu et al., 2024; Hou et al., 2024). The primary algorithms for generating DP synthetic data for FL applications require careful prompt engineering based on public information and/or iterative private client feedback. Our key insight is that the private client feedback collected by prior DP synthetic data methods (Hou et al., 2024; Xie et al., 2024) can be viewed as a preference ranking. Our algorithm, Preference Optimization for Private Client Data (POPri) harnesses client feedback using preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune LLMs to generate high-quality DP synthetic data. To evaluate POPri, we release LargeFedBench, a new federated text benchmark for uncontaminated LLM evaluations on federated client data. POPri substantially improves the utility of DP synthetic data relative to prior work on LargeFedBench datasets and an existing benchmark from Xie et al. (2024). POPri closes the gap between next-token prediction accuracy in the fully-private and non-private settings by up to 68%, compared to 52% for prior synthetic data methods, and 10% for state-of-the-art DP federated learning methods. The code and data are available at https://github.com/meiyuw/POPri.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a novel numerical method for analyzing severe accidents in nuclear power plants using physics-informed neural networks (PINN). The traditional thermal-hydraulic (TH) system codes like MELCOR and MAAP have limitations due to their finite difference schemes. The proposed node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) addresses these limitations by assigning a network to each nodalization, ensuring spatial information is excluded from input and output domains. The accuracy of PINN methods was evaluated for a hydrodynamic module, with NA-PINN showing superior accuracy compared to regular PINN. This study marks the first successful implementation of a system code using PINN. Future work aims to extend NA-PINN to a multi-physics solver and develop it in a surrogate manner.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Severe accidents (SAs) in nuclear power plants have been analyzed using thermal-hydraulic (TH) system codes such as MELCOR and MAAP. These codes efficiently simulate the progression of SAs, while they still have inherent limitations due to their inconsistent finite difference schemes. The use of empirical schemes incorporating both implicit and explicit formulations inherently induces unidirectional coupling in multi-physics analyses. The objective of this study is to develop a novel numerical method for TH system codes using physics-informed neural network (PINN). They have shown strength in solving multi-physics due to the innate feature of neural networks-automatic differentiation. We propose a node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) that is suitable for the control volume approach-based system codes. NA-PINN addresses the issue of spatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each nodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from both the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a purely temporal solution. In this phase, we evaluated the accuracy of the PINN methods for the hydrodynamic module. In the 6 water tank simulation, PINN and NA-PINN showed maximum absolute errors of 1.678 and 0.007, respectively. It should be noted that only NA-PINN demonstrated acceptable accuracy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to successfully implement a system code using PINN. Our future work involves extending NA-PINN to a multi-physics solver and developing it in a surrogate manner.

<div> contraction factor, perturbation factor, generalization gap, deep network, gradient descent<br />
Summary:<br />
The article presents a differential equation that describes the evolution of the generalization gap in deep networks trained using gradient descent. The equation is influenced by a contraction factor that brings together trajectories from slightly different datasets and a perturbation factor accounting for training on distinct datasets. Through analysis, an "effective Gram matrix" is computed to predict the generalization gap post-training by considering alignment with an initial residual. Empirical assessments on image classification datasets show accurate test loss prediction. During training, the residual primarily resides in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix's smallest eigenvalues, indicating a benign training process with minimal generalization gap deterioration. The alignment between the effective Gram matrix and the residual varies based on dataset and architecture, determining good or poor generalization performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a differential equation that governs the evolution of the generalization gap when a deep network is trained by gradient descent. This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap after training in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, at any point during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the training process is benign, i.e., it does not lead to significant deterioration of the generalization gap (which is zero at initialization). The alignment between the effective Gram matrix and the residual is different for different datasets and architectures. The match/mismatch of the data and the architecture is primarily responsible for good/bad generalization.

<div> evaluation scenario, continual learning, user representation learning, adaptive, item distribution

Summary:<br />
Traditional user modeling approaches are limited in their ability to generalize and adapt to various tasks. Recent studies have focused on continual learning for universal user representation learning, aiming to create models capable of handling multiple tasks. However, existing methods are evaluated in unrealistic scenarios that do not consider the passage of time and changes in item distribution as tasks progress. This paper introduces a practical evaluation scenario that takes into account these factors. A novel framework called DITTO is proposed to address catastrophic forgetting and adapt to the shifting item distribution over time. Extensive experiments show that DITTO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in this practical evaluation scenario. The source code for DITTO is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Traditional user modeling (UM) approaches have primarily focused on designing models for a single specific task, but they face limitations in generalization and adaptability across various tasks. Recognizing these challenges, recent studies have shifted towards continual learning (CL)-based universal user representation learning aiming to develop a single model capable of handling multiple tasks. Despite advancements, existing methods are in fact evaluated under an unrealistic scenario that does not consider the passage of time as tasks progress, which overlooks newly emerged items that may change the item distribution of previous tasks. In this paper, we introduce a practical evaluation scenario on which CL-based universal user representation learning approaches should be evaluated, which takes into account the passage of time as tasks progress. Then, we propose a novel framework Dynamic Time-aware continual user representation learner, named DITTO, designed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting despite continuous shifts in item distribution, while also allowing the knowledge acquired from previous tasks to adapt to the current shifted item distribution. Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of DITTO over state-of-the-art methods under a practical evaluation scenario.

Synthetic data generation offers a solution by using generative models to create realistic and privacy-preserving samples. Various methods such as energy-based models, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, large language models, and diffusion models have been explored. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of these methods, covering traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models.

Abstract: Tabular data remains one of the most prevalent and critical data formats across diverse real-world applications. However, its effective use in machine learning (ML) is often constrained by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and class imbalance. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging generative models to learn the distribution of real datasets and produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving samples. Various generative paradigms have been explored, including energy-based models (EBMs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models. While several surveys have investigated synthetic tabular data generation, most focus on narrow subdomains or specific generative methods, such as GANs, diffusion models, or privacy-preserving techniques. This limited scope often results in fragmented insights, lacking a comprehensive synthesis that bridges diverse approaches. In particular, recent advances driven by LLMs and diffusion-based models remain underexplored. This gap hinders a holistic understanding of the field`s evolution, methodological interplay, and open challenges. To address this, our survey provides a unified and systematic review of synthetic tabular data generation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes existing methods into traditional approaches, diffusion-based methods, and LLM-based models, and provide an in-depth comparative analysis; (2) we detail the complete pipeline for synthetic tabular data generation, including data synthesis, post-processing, and evaluation; (3) we identify major challenges, explore real-world applications, and outline open research questions and future directions to guide future work in this rapidly evolving area.

Summary:
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations, including the Helmholtz equation for scattered acoustic wavefield simulation. However, traditional training using gradient descent (GD) faces issues like slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. To address this, a hybrid optimization framework has been developed that integrates a least-squares (LS) solver into the GD loss function, resulting in faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability. The new method is effective for both scenarios with or without perfectly matched layers (PML) and operates on small matrices, making it scalable for large-scale simulations. This approach outperformed standard GD-based training, showing rapid convergence even in challenging cases where traditional methods fail.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), including the frequency-domain Helmholtz equation. However, standard training of PINNs using gradient descent (GD) suffers from slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. For scattered acoustic wavefield simulation based on Helmholtz equation, we derive a hybrid optimization framework that accelerates training convergence by embedding a least-squares (LS) solver directly into the GD loss function. This formulation enables optimal updates for the linear output layer. Our method is applicable with or without perfectly matched layers (PML), and we provide practical tensor-based implementations for both scenarios. Numerical experiments on benchmark velocity models demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability compared to conventional PINN training. In particular, our results show that the LS-enhanced method converges rapidly even in cases where standard GD-based training fails. The LS solver operates on a small normal matrix, ensuring minimal computational overhead and making the method scalable for large-scale wavefield simulations.

The paper introduces a novel generative framework that combines Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with Transformer-based hypernetworks in latent variable models. This approach overcomes the limitations of previous methods using MLP-based hypernetworks by employing a Transformer-based decoder for generating INR parameters from latent variables. The framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation, replacing standard decoders with Transformer-based hypernetworks for improved representation capacity and computational efficiency. The model can be trained from scratch or through hyper-transforming, fine-tuning the decoder while keeping the pre-trained latent space frozen. This allows for efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without the need for complete retraining.<br />

This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining.

Summary:
- Penalized logistic regression (PLR) with regularization terms addresses overfitting but relies on efficient variable selection strategies.
- Label noise from manual labeling aids variable selection by providing more accurate estimation of selected coefficients.
- In large-scale settings, distributed computing is necessary for PLR with manual labeling.
- A partition-insensitive parallel algorithm based on ADMM is proposed for PLR, ensuring solutions remain consistent with distributed data storage.
- The algorithm has global convergence and sublinear convergence rate, outperforming traditional variable selection techniques in large-scale datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large-scale supervised learning, penalized logistic regression (PLR) effectively addresses the overfitting problem by introducing regularization terms yet its performance still depends on efficient variable selection strategies. This paper theoretically demonstrates that label noise stemming from manual labeling, which is solely related to classification difficulty, represents a type of beneficial noise for variable selection in PLR. This benefit is reflected in a more accurate estimation of the selected non-zero coefficients when compared with the case where only truth labels are used. Under large-scale settings, the sample size for PLR can become very large, making it infeasible to store on a single machine. In such cases, distributed computing methods are required to handle PLR model with manual labeling. This paper presents a partition-insensitive parallel algorithm founded on the ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers) algorithm to address PLR by incorporating manual labeling. The partition insensitivity of the proposed algorithm refers to the fact that the solutions obtained by the algorithm will not change with the distributed storage of data. In addition, the algorithm has global convergence and a sublinear convergence rate. Experimental results indicate that, as compared with traditional variable selection classification techniques, the PLR with manually-labeled noisy data achieves higher estimation and classification accuracy across multiple large-scale datasets.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new technique for compositional learning of synchronizing parallel systems with unknown decompositions using active automata learning. This approach refines the global alphabet into component alphabets while simultaneously learning the component models. The authors develop a theoretical framework for distributions of alphabets, characterizing counter-examples that reveal inconsistencies in global observations. By systematically updating the distribution, consistency can be restored. A compositional learning algorithm, CoalA, is presented, utilizing the LearnLib active learning library. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in membership queries, with up to five orders of magnitude enhancements, and increased scalability in systems with significant concurrency. This advancement enhances the efficacy and efficiency of automata learning in complex concurrent systems.

Abstract: Active automata learning infers automaton models of systems from behavioral observations, a technique successfully applied to a wide range of domains. Compositional approaches for concurrent systems have recently emerged. We take a significant step beyond available results, including those by the authors, and develop a general technique for compositional learning of a synchronizing parallel system with an unknown decomposition. Our approach automatically refines the global alphabet into component alphabets while learning the component models. We develop a theoretical treatment of distributions of alphabets, i.e., sets of possibly overlapping component alphabets. We characterize counter-examples that reveal inconsistencies with global observations, and show how to systematically update the distribution to restore consistency. We present a compositional learning algorithm implementing these ideas, where learning counterexamples precisely correspond to distribution counterexamples under well-defined conditions. We provide an implementation, called CoalA, using the state-of-the-art active learning library LearnLib. Our experiments show that in more than 630 subject systems, CoalA delivers orders of magnitude improvements (up to five orders) in membership queries and in systems with significant concurrency, it also achieves better scalability in the number of equivalence queries.

Experimental results have shown that ParetoHqD outperforms five baselines on two multiobjective alignment tasks.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with multiple human expectations and values is crucial for ensuring that they adequately serve a variety of user needs. To this end, offline multiobjective alignment algorithms such as the Rewards-in-Context algorithm have shown strong performance and efficiency. However, inappropriate preference representations and training with imbalanced reward scores limit the performance of such algorithms. In this work, we introduce ParetoHqD that addresses the above issues by representing human preferences as preference directions in the objective space and regarding data near the Pareto front as ''high-quality'' data. For each preference, ParetoHqD follows a two-stage supervised fine-tuning process, where each stage uses an individual Pareto high-quality training set that best matches its preference direction. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of ParetoHqD over five baselines on two multiobjective alignment tasks.

Abstract: Traditional Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) models frequently underperform when handling data characterized by uneven categories. To address the issue, this paper proposes a Data Augmentation Partial Least Squares Regression (DAPLSR) model via manifold optimization. The DAPLSR model introduces the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to increase the number of samples and utilizes the Value Difference Metric (VDM) to select the nearest neighbor samples that closely resemble the original samples for generating synthetic samples. In solving the model, in order to obtain a more accurate numerical solution for PLSR, this paper proposes a manifold optimization method that uses the geometric properties of the constraint space to improve model degradation and optimization. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed DAPLSR model achieves superior classification performance and outstanding evaluation metrics on various datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new self-supervised representation learning method called Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss that combines the strengths of contrastive and non-contrastive methods. By converting a contrastive method into a non-contrastive form, MINC reduces variance while maintaining mutual information formulation to prevent collapse to a constant vector. Tested on ImageNet data, MINC outperforms the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline in learning image representations. This innovative approach enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of self-supervised learning, providing a promising solution for leveraging unlabeled data in various downstream tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Labeling data is often very time consuming and expensive, leaving us with a majority of unlabeled data. Self-supervised representation learning methods such as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very successful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image data, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for downstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1) Contrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as BYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information between related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every other data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch sizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance as they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to implement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In this paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the strength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called the Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we convert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise comparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information formulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse. We call our new objective the Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss. We test MINC by learning image representations on ImageNet (similar to SimCLR and BYOL) and show that it consistently improves upon the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline.

<div> Keywords: Federated learning, Shapley value, data valuation, approximation algorithm, efficiency

Summary: 
The article introduces a federated learning paradigm for utilizing datasets from multiple providers. It discusses the challenges of data valuation in federated learning and advocates for the use of Shapley value as a metric. However, the computational overhead of Shapley value has limited its practical application. The article proposes a unified stratified-sampling framework for approximation, analyzes and selects a promising scheme for computation, and identifies key combinations of datasets that have a high impact on data value. Based on these insights, an approximation algorithm called IPSS is introduced, which strategically selects high-impact dataset combinations to reduce time cost while maintaining accuracy. Extensive evaluations on FL benchmark datasets show that IPSS outperforms existing baselines in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: Federated learning paradigm to utilize datasets across multiple data providers. In FL, cross-silo data providers often hesitate to share their high-quality dataset unless their data value can be fairly assessed. Shapley value (SV) has been advocated as the standard metric for data valuation in FL due to its desirable properties. However, the computational overhead of SV is prohibitive in practice, as it inherently requires training and evaluating an FL model across an exponential number of dataset combinations. Furthermore, existing solutions fail to achieve high accuracy and efficiency, making practical use of SV still out of reach, because they ignore choosing suitable computation scheme for approximation framework and overlook the property of utility function in FL. We first propose a unified stratified-sampling framework for two widely-used schemes. Then, we analyze and choose the more promising scheme under the FL linear regression assumption. After that, we identify a phenomenon termed key combinations, where only limited dataset combinations have a high-impact on final data value. Building on these insights, we propose a practical approximation algorithm, IPSS, which strategically selects high-impact dataset combinations rather than evaluating all possible combinations, thus substantially reducing time cost with minor approximation error. Furthermore, we conduct extensive evaluations on the FL benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms a series of representative baselines in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

<br />
In this paper, a wavelet-based theoretical framework is developed to analyze the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks with various activation functions. The framework utilizes wavelet frame theory on spaces of homogeneous type to derive sufficient conditions for activation functions that ensure neural networks can approximate any functions within the specified space, with an error estimate provided. These conditions accommodate smooth activation functions, including those with oscillatory behavior. By considering the $L^2$-distance between smooth and non-smooth activation functions, a generalized approximation result is established for non-smooth activations, with the error explicitly controlled by this distance. This allows for more flexibility in designing network architectures.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new framework for Bayesian estimation of differential privacy that considers evidence from multiple membership inference attacks (MIA). The proposed method, MCMC-DP-Est, utilizes a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the full posterior distribution of the privacy parameter. Unlike traditional approaches, this method does not assume the use of the most powerful attack on the worst-case dataset, providing a more realistic privacy analysis. By jointly estimating the strengths of MIAs and the privacy of the training algorithm, a more cautious evaluation of privacy is achieved. Additionally, the article presents a cost-effective method for measuring the performance of an MIA to be used in the estimation process. Numerical examples with artificial and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in estimating privacy parameters. <div>

Abstract: We propose a new framework for Bayesian estimation of differential privacy, incorporating evidence from multiple membership inference attacks (MIA). Bayesian estimation is carried out via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, named MCMC-DP-Est, which provides an estimate of the full posterior distribution of the privacy parameter (e.g., instead of just credible intervals). Critically, the proposed method does not assume that privacy auditing is performed with the most powerful attack on the worst-case (dataset, challenge point) pair, which is typically unrealistic. Instead, MCMC-DP-Est jointly estimates the strengths of MIAs used and the privacy of the training algorithm, yielding a more cautious privacy analysis. We also present an economical way to generate measurements for the performance of an MIA that is to be used by the MCMC method to estimate privacy. We present the use of the methods with numerical examples with both artificial and real data.

Summary:
PIN-WM is a novel approach for learning non-prehensile manipulation skills in robotics. By learning a world model of 3D rigid body dynamics, PIN-WM enables robust policy learning and generalization for model-based reinforcement learning. This approach utilizes differentiable physics simulation to identify the dynamical system from visual observations with only a few-shot physical interaction trajectories. PIN-WM is trained with an observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without requiring state estimation. To address the Sim2Real gap, the learned PIN-WM is transformed into a set of Digital Cousins through physics-aware randomizations that generate diverse variations. Extensive evaluations in simulation and real-world environments show that PIN-WM, coupled with physics-aware digital cousins, enhances the learning of non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in Real2Sim2Real scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: PIN-WM is a pioneering method that uses a world model of 3D rigid body dynamics to improve learning of non-prehensile manipulation skills in robotics through reinforcement learning. By leveraging differentiable physics simulation, observational loss, and physics-aware digital cousins, PIN-WM achieves robust policy learning and generalization with superior Sim2Real transfer capabilities. <div>

Abstract: While non-prehensile manipulation (e.g., controlled pushing/poking) constitutes a foundational robotic skill, its learning remains challenging due to the high sensitivity to complex physical interactions involving friction and restitution. To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.

<div> Keywords: multi-document summarization, transformer-based models, query selection, document ranking, elementary discourse units

Summary: 
Our proposed framework addresses the input length limitation in multi-document summarization by integrating query selection, document ranking, and shortening into a unified process. Instead of relying on manually crafted queries, our approach identifies salient elementary discourse units (EDUs) from input documents and uses them as latent queries to guide document ranking. By filtering out irrelevant EDUs rather than truncating, we ensure that only critical information is preserved for summarization. Through evaluations on multiple datasets, our framework consistently improves ROUGE metrics and demonstrates scalability and flexibility across different model architectures. Analysis shows our framework's ability to dynamically select appropriate queries and accurately rank documents based on relevance scores. This results in an effective solution for addressing context-length constraints in multi-document summarization, establishing our framework as a robust and reliable tool.

arXiv:2504.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of multi-document summarization (MDS), transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable success, yet they suffer an input length limitation. Current methods apply truncation after the retrieval process to fit the context length; however, they heavily depend on manually well-crafted queries, which are impractical to create for each document set for MDS. Additionally, these methods retrieve information at a coarse granularity, leading to the inclusion of irrelevant content. To address these issues, we propose a novel retrieval-based framework that integrates query selection and document ranking and shortening into a unified process. Our approach identifies the most salient elementary discourse units (EDUs) from input documents and utilizes them as latent queries. These queries guide the document ranking by calculating relevance scores. Instead of traditional truncation, our approach filters out irrelevant EDUs to fit the context length, ensuring that only critical information is preserved for summarization. We evaluate our framework on multiple MDS datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in ROUGE metrics while confirming its scalability and flexibility across diverse model architectures. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness through an in-depth analysis, emphasizing its ability to dynamically select appropriate queries and accurately rank documents based on their relevance scores. These results demonstrate that our framework effectively addresses context-length constraints, establishing it as a robust and reliable solution for MDS.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has recently made progress as an unsupervised graph representation learning paradigm. GCL approaches can be categorized into augmentation-based and augmentation-free methods. The former relies on complex data augmentations, while the latter depends on encoders that can generate distinct views of the same input. Both approaches may require negative samples for training. In this paper, we introduce a novel augmentation-free GCL framework based on graph neural diffusion models. Specifically, we utilize learnable encoders governed by Fractional Differential Equations (FDE). Each FDE is characterized by an order parameter of the differential operator. We demonstrate that varying these parameters allows us to produce learnable encoders that generate diverse views, capturing either local or global information, for contrastive learning. Our model does not require negative samples for training and is applicable to both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a powerful method for solving combinatorial optimization problems on quantum devices. However, as the number of layers in the QAOA circuit increases, the optimization burden grows due to the linear increase in parameters. To address this issue, QAOA-PCA introduces a novel reparameterization technique utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce parameter space dimensionality. Through extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller instances, QAOA-PCA enables more efficient optimization on larger problems. Empirical evaluations on the MaxCut problem show that QAOA-PCA requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving notable efficiency gains with only a slight reduction in approximation ratio. Overall, QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead while maintaining solution quality.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising variational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term devices. However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit increases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of parameters to optimize grows linearly. This results in more iterations required by the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden as more circuit executions are needed. To mitigate this issue, we introduce QAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space. By extracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem instances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on larger instances. Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem demonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard QAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains. While this comes at the cost of a slight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number of layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by parameter count. QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and performance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising solution quality.

Summary: 
Memory-based continual learning methods are crucial for adapting to novel data distributions after deployment. This work explores the impact of label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning, where new classes are added over time without access to past class data. The study focuses on the sensitivity of continual learning algorithms that utilize replay memory constructed with Coresets. A new bound for robustness to uncorrelated instance noise is derived, leading to the development of noise-tolerant replay buffer algorithms. Empirical evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that existing memory-based continual learners are not robust, while the proposed algorithms significantly improve classification accuracy and minimize forgetting in noisy class-incremental learning scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2504.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications of computer vision require the ability to adapt to novel data distributions after deployment. Adaptation requires algorithms capable of continual learning (CL). Continual learners must be plastic to adapt to novel tasks while minimizing forgetting of previous tasks.However, CL opens up avenues for noise to enter the training pipeline and disrupt the CL. This work focuses on label noise and instance noise in the context of class-incremental learning (CIL), where new classes are added to a classifier over time, and there is no access to external data from past classes. We aim to understand the sensitivity of CL methods that work by replaying items from a memory constructed using the idea of Coresets. We derive a new bound for the robustness of such a method to uncorrelated instance noise under a general additive noise threat model, revealing several insights. Putting the theory into practice, we create two continual learning algorithms to construct noise-tolerant replay buffers. We empirically compare the effectiveness of prior memory-based continual learners and the proposed algorithms under label and uncorrelated instance noise on five diverse datasets. We show that existing memory-based CL are not robust whereas the proposed methods exhibit significant improvements in maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing forgetting in the noisy CIL setting.

Summary: 
This study introduces an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear spatio-temporal signals using dimensionality reduction and a generalized autoregressive model. The framework integrates proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection, a reservoir computer for forecasting reduced dynamics, and ensemble sequential data assimilation for online adaptation. The method is demonstrated on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, considering assimilation of full flow fields and sparse sensors. The study explores three scenarios: na\"ive physical state estimation, two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states, and three-fold estimation adjusting model parameters. The two-fold strategy enhances ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction error compared to the na\"ive approach. The three-fold approach allows robust online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming limitations of a priori training. This work combines data-driven reduced order modeling with Bayesian data assimilation, offering new opportunities for scalable online model learning in nonlinear time series forecasting.

Summary:
This paper introduces ThinkPRM, a data-efficient process reward model for step-by-step verification. ThinkPRM generates a verification chain-of-thought (CoT) to verify each step of a solution, requiring minimal supervision for training. The model outperforms discriminative verifiers and LLM-as-a-Judge, using only 1% of the process labels needed by traditional PRMs. Performance evaluations on ProcessBench, MATH-500, AIME '24, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench show that ThinkPRM surpasses discriminative verifiers by significant margins. In an out-of-domain evaluation, ThinkPRM excels by 8% and 4.5% on subsets of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, respectively. Additionally, ThinkPRM scales verification compute more effectively than LLM-as-a-Judge, achieving a 7.2% improvement on a subset of ProcessBench under the same token budget. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of generative, long CoT PRMs for test-time verification, showcasing their ability to scale verification compute while requiring minimal training supervision.

Abstract: Step-by-step verifiers -- also known as process reward models (PRMs) -- are a key ingredient for test-time scaling. PRMs require step-level supervision, making them expensive to train. This work aims to build data-efficient PRMs as verbalized step-wise reward models that verify every step in the solution by generating a verification chain-of-thought (CoT). We propose ThinkPRM, a long CoT verifier fine-tuned on orders of magnitude fewer process labels than those required by discriminative PRMs. Our approach capitalizes on the inherent reasoning abilities of long CoT models, and outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and discriminative verifiers -- using only 1% of the process labels in PRM800K -- across several challenging benchmarks. Specifically, ThinkPRM beats the baselines on ProcessBench, MATH-500, and AIME '24 under best-of-N selection and reward-guided search. In an out-of-domain evaluation on a subset of GPQA-Diamond and LiveCodeBench, our PRM surpasses discriminative verifiers trained on the full PRM800K by 8% and 4.5%, respectively. Lastly, under the same token budget, ThinkPRM scales up verification compute more effectively compared to LLM-as-a-Judge, outperforming it by 7.2% on a subset of ProcessBench. Our work highlights the value of generative, long CoT PRMs that can scale test-time compute for verification while requiring minimal supervision for training.

Summary:  
- The study explores the use of neural networks to create parametric and invertible multidimensional data projections simultaneously.  
- Parametric projections allow for embedding new data without the need to recompute the entire projection.  
- Invertible projections enable the generation of new data points.  
- Three autoencoder architectures were evaluated for their ability to create parametric and invertible projections.  
- Results suggest that autoencoders with a customized loss function can produce smoother projections compared to feed-forward neural networks, offering users control over the smoothing effect. <div>
arXiv:2504.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, neural networks have gained attention for creating parametric and invertible multidimensional data projections. Parametric projections allow for embedding previously unseen data without recomputing the projection as a whole, while invertible projections enable the generation of new data points. However, these properties have never been explored simultaneously for arbitrary projection methods. We evaluate three autoencoder (AE) architectures for creating parametric and invertible projections. Based on a given projection, we train AEs to learn a mapping into 2D space and an inverse mapping into the original space. We perform a quantitative and qualitative comparison on four datasets of varying dimensionality and pattern complexity using t-SNE. Our results indicate that AEs with a customized loss function can create smoother parametric and inverse projections than feed-forward neural networks while giving users control over the strength of the smoothing effect.

Summary: 
Accurate wave height prediction is essential for maritime safety and coastal resilience. Conventional models and machine learning methods struggle with computational efficiency and nonlinear dynamics. The study introduces Chronos, a new temporal architecture powered by a large language model, optimizing wave forecasting. This framework reduces training time by 14.3% and improves inference speed by 2.5x, achieving a mean absolute scaled error (MASE) of 0.575 units.

Abstract: Accurate wave height prediction is critical for maritime safety and coastal resilience, yet conventional physics-based models and traditional machine learning methods face challenges in computational efficiency and nonlinear dynamics modeling. This study introduces Chronos, the first implementation of a large language model (LLM)-powered temporal architecture (Chronos) optimized for wave forecasting. Through advanced temporal pattern recognition applied to historical wave data from three strategically chosen marine zones in the Northwest Pacific basin, our framework achieves multimodal improvements: (1) 14.3% reduction in training time with 2.5x faster inference speed compared to PatchTST baselines, achieving 0.575 mean absolute scaled error (MASE) units; (2) superior short-term forecasting (1-24h) across comprehensive metrics; (3) sustained predictive leadership in extended-range forecasts (1-120h); and (4) demonstrated zero-shot capability maintaining median performance (rank 4/12) against specialized operational models. This LLM-enhanced temporal modeling paradigm establishes a new standard in wave prediction, offering both computationally efficient solutions and a transferable framework for complex geophysical systems modeling.

Summary: 
This study investigates the combination of transfer learning (TL) and federated learning (FL) for adapting thermal machine learning models for power converters. The framework utilizes three domain adaptation techniques: Fine-tuning, Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), and Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA) to incrementally adapt a base model. FL using the Flower framework and Federated Averaging for aggregation is employed. Fine-tuning demonstrates high accuracy and practicality for real-world applications.

Abstract: This study explores alternative framework configurations for adapting thermal machine learning (ML) models for power converters by combining transfer learning (TL) and federated learning (FL) in a piecewise manner. This approach inherently addresses challenges such as varying operating conditions, data sharing limitations, and security implications. The framework starts with a base model that is incrementally adapted by multiple clients via adapting three state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques: Fine-tuning, Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), and Deep Domain Adaptation (DDA). The Flower framework is employed for FL, using Federated Averaging for aggregation. Validation with field data demonstrates that fine-tuning offers a straightforward TL approach with high accuracy, making it suitable for practical applications. Benchmarking results reveal a comprehensive comparison of these methods, showcasing their respective strengths and weaknesses when applied in different scenarios. Locally hosted FL enhances performance when data aggregation is not feasible, while cloud-based FL becomes more practical with a significant increase in the number of clients, addressing scalability and connectivity challenges.

<div> domain-specific nuances, Large Language Models, hidden states, domain recognition, model selection

Summary: 
The study investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently capture domain-specific nuances in natural language. Through experiments, it is found that LLMs can distinguish queries from different domains based on hidden states generated during the prefill phase. The internal recognition of query domains is represented by latent domain-related trajectories within the models. The research also explores the robustness of these domain representations to variations in prompt styles and sources. The study utilizes these representations for model selection, choosing the LLM that best matches the domain trace of the input query. Surprisingly, the fine-tuned model is not always the most accurate choice. The findings indicate that LLMs can differentiate queries for related domains effectively, encompassing both closed and open-ended generative tasks. <div>

Abstract: We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently capture domain-specific nuances in natural language. Our experiments probe the domain sensitivity of LLMs by examining their ability to distinguish queries from different domains using hidden states generated during the prefill phase.

We also study the robustness of these domain representations to variations in prompt styles and sources. Our approach leverages these representations for model selection, mapping the LLM that best matches the domain trace of the input query (i.e., the model with the highest performance on similar traces). Our findings show that LLMs can differentiate queries for related domains, and that the fine-tuned model is not always the most accurate. Unlike previous work, our interpretations apply to both closed and open-ended generative tasks

<div> Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control, hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control, adaptability, safe control<br />
Summary:<br />
The study introduces a hybrid approach combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control (ML-MPC) for optimizing hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control. RL offers adaptability to changing conditions, while ML-MPC ensures safe and optimal controls within predefined safety limits. The hybrid system dynamically adjusts the ML-MPC load tracking reference using an RL agent to respond to environment changes, maintaining safe control inputs. Experimental results show that RL successfully adapts to dynamic conditions, improving load tracking by reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) to 0.44 bar. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in addressing the challenges posed by high variance in control inputs and system drifts in engine applications. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control (ML-MPC) are promising approaches for optimizing hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control, as they can effectively control multiple-input multiple-output systems and nonlinear processes. ML-MPC is advantageous for providing safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within predefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability to changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the practical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires high variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose risks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to mechanical damage. Conversely, ML-MPC relies on an accurate system model to generate optimal control inputs and has limited adaptability to system drifts, such as injector aging, which naturally occur in engine applications. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid RL and ML-MPC approach that uses an ML-MPC framework while incorporating an RL agent to dynamically adjust the ML-MPC load tracking reference in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, the ML-MPC ensures that actions stay safe throughout the RL agent's exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, fuel pressure is deliberately varied to introduce a model-plant mismatch between the ML-MPC and the engine test bench. The result of this mismatch is a root mean square error (RMSE) in indicated mean effective pressure of 0.57 bar when running the ML-MPC. The experimental results demonstrate that RL successfully adapts to changing boundary conditions by altering the tracking reference while ML-MPC ensures safe control inputs. The quantitative improvement in load tracking by implementing RL is an RSME of 0.44 bar.

Abstract: As the field of representation learning grows, there has been a proliferation of different loss functions to solve different classes of problems. We introduce a single information-theoretic equation that generalizes a large collection of modern loss functions in machine learning. In particular, we introduce a framework that shows that several broad classes of machine learning methods are precisely minimizing an integrated KL divergence between two conditional distributions: the supervisory and learned representations. This viewpoint exposes a hidden information geometry underlying clustering, spectral methods, dimensionality reduction, contrastive learning, and supervised learning. This framework enables the development of new loss functions by combining successful techniques from across the literature. We not only present a wide array of proofs, connecting over 23 different approaches, but we also leverage these theoretical results to create state-of-the-art unsupervised image classifiers that achieve a +8% improvement over the prior state-of-the-art on unsupervised classification on ImageNet-1K. We also demonstrate that I-Con can be used to derive principled debiasing methods which improve contrastive representation learners.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the critical need for efficient diagnostic tools such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly transformers, have revolutionized ECG analysis by capturing detailed waveform features as well as global rhythm patterns. However, traditional transformers struggle to effectively capture local morphological features that are critical for accurate ECG interpretation. We propose a novel Local-Global Attention ECG model (LGA-ECG) to address this limitation, integrating convolutional inductive biases with global self-attention mechanisms. Our approach extracts queries by averaging embeddings obtained from overlapping convolutional windows, enabling fine-grained morphological analysis, while simultaneously modeling global context through attention to keys and values derived from the entire sequence. Experiments conducted on the CODE-15 dataset demonstrate that LGA-ECG outperforms state-of-the-art models and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the local-global attention strategy. By capturing the hierarchical temporal dependencies and morphological patterns in ECG signals, this new design showcases its potential for clinical deployment with robust automated ECG classification.

Abstract: We present SeizureFormer, a Transformer-based model for long-term seizure risk forecasting using interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) surrogate biomarkers and long episode (LE) biomarkers from responsive neurostimulation (RNS) systems. Unlike raw scalp EEG-based models, SeizureFormer leverages structured, clinically relevant features and integrates CNN-based patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks to model both short-term dynamics and long-term seizure cycles. Tested across five patients and multiple prediction windows (1 to 14 days), SeizureFormer achieved state-of-the-art performance with mean ROC AUC of 79.44 percent and mean PR AUC of 76.29 percent. Compared to statistical, machine learning, and deep learning baselines, it demonstrates enhanced generalizability and seizure risk forecasting performance under class imbalance. This work supports future clinical integration of interpretable and robust seizure forecasting tools for personalized epilepsy management.

<title>Towards Accurate Forecasting of Renewable Energy : Building Datasets and Benchmarking Machine Learning Models for Solar and Wind Power in France</title>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources is essential for grid stability and price prediction. Regional power supply forecasts are usually indirect through a bottom-up approach of plant-level forecasts, incorporate lagged power values, and do not use the potential of spatially resolved data. This study presents a comprehensive methodology for predicting solar and wind power production at country scale in France using machine learning models trained with spatially explicit weather data combined with spatial information about production sites capacity. A dataset is built spanning from 2012 to 2023, using daily power production data from RTE (the national grid operator) as the target variable, with daily weather data from ERA5, production sites capacity and location, and electricity prices as input features. Three modeling approaches are explored to handle spatially resolved weather data: spatial averaging over the country, dimension reduction through principal component analysis, and a computer vision architecture to exploit complex spatial relationships. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art machine learning models as well as hyperparameter tuning approaches based on cross-validation methods on daily power production data. Results indicate that cross-validation tailored to time series is best suited to reach low error. We found that neural networks tend to outperform traditional tree-based models, which face challenges in extrapolation due to the increasing renewable capacity over time. Model performance ranges from 4% to 10% in nRMSE for midterm horizon, achieving similar error metrics to local models established at a single-plant level, highlighting the potential of these methods for regional power supply forecasting.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the critical need for efficient and accurate diagnostic tools. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are indispensable in diagnosing various heart conditions; however, their manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose xLSTM-ECG, a novel approach that leverages an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network for multi-label classification of ECG signals, using the PTB-XL dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first design and application of xLSTM modules specifically adapted for multi-label ECG classification. Our method employs a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to convert time-series ECG waveforms into the frequency domain, thereby enhancing feature extraction. The xLSTM architecture is specifically tailored to address the complexities of 12-lead ECG recordings by capturing both local and global signal features. Comprehensive experiments on the PTB-XL dataset reveal that our model achieves strong multi-label classification performance, while additional tests on the Georgia 12-Lead dataset underscore its robustness and efficiency. This approach significantly improves ECG classification accuracy, thereby advancing clinical diagnostics and patient care. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Fields offer a versatile approach for describing complex systems composed of interacting and dynamic components. In particular, some of these dynamical and stochastic systems may exhibit goal-directed behaviors aimed at achieving specific objectives, which we refer to as $\textit{intelligent fields}$. However, due to their inherent complexity, it remains challenging to develop a formal theoretical description of such systems and to effectively translate these descriptions into practical applications. In this paper, we propose three fundamental principles -- complete configuration, locality, and purposefulness -- to establish a theoretical framework for understanding intelligent fields. Moreover, we explore methodologies for designing such fields from the perspective of artificial intelligence applications. This initial investigation aims to lay the groundwork for future theoretical developments and practical advances in understanding and harnessing the potential of such objective-driven dynamical stochastic fields.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computational linguistic techniques are increasingly being applied across various domains, yet their use in legal and regulatory tasks remains limited. To address this gap, we develop an efficient bilingual question-answering framework for regulatory documents, specifically the Bangladesh Police Gazettes, which contain both English and Bangla text. Our approach employs modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to enhance information retrieval and response generation. In addition to conventional RAG pipelines, we propose an advanced RAG-based approach that improves retrieval performance, leading to more precise answers. This system enables efficient searching for specific government legal notices, making legal information more accessible. We evaluate both our proposed and conventional RAG systems on a diverse test set on Bangladesh Police Gazettes, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Integrating deep learning applications into agricultural IoT systems faces a serious challenge of balancing the high accuracy of Vision Transformers (ViTs) with the efficiency demands of resource-constrained edge devices. Large transformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease classification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their computational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them impractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as MobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the required spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically transfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a MobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive attention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution, channels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and spatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled MobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95% reduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices. (23ms on PC CPU and 86ms/image on smartphone CPUs). Key innovations include IoT-centric validation metrics (13 MB memory, 0.22 GFLOPs) and dynamic resolution-matching attention maps. Comparative experiments show significant improvements over standalone CNNs and prior distillation methods, with a 3.5% accuracy gain over MobileNetV3 baselines. Significantly, this work advances real-time, energy-efficient crop monitoring in precision agriculture and demonstrates how we can attain ViT-level diagnostic precision on edge devices. Code and models will be made available for replication after acceptance.

Abstract: LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks requiring multifaceted reasoning and collaboration, from generating high-quality presentation slides to conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal algorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: https://github.com/jwliao-ai/MARFT.

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy serves as a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing the chemical information of substances. The integration of Raman spectroscopy with deep learning methods enables rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of materials. Most existing approaches adopt supervised learning methods. Although supervised learning has achieved satisfactory accuracy in spectral analysis, it is still constrained by costly and limited well-annotated spectral datasets for training. When spectral annotation is challenging or the amount of annotated data is insufficient, the performance of supervised learning in spectral material identification declines. In order to address the challenge of feature extraction from unannotated spectra, we propose a self-supervised learning paradigm for Raman Spectroscopy based on a Masked AutoEncoder, termed SMAE. SMAE does not require any spectral annotations during pre-training. By randomly masking and then reconstructing the spectral information, the model learns essential spectral features. The reconstructed spectra exhibit certain denoising properties, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than twofold. Utilizing the network weights obtained from masked pre-training, SMAE achieves clustering accuracy of over 80% for 30 classes of isolated bacteria in a pathogenic bacterial dataset, demonstrating significant improvements compared to classical unsupervised methods and other state-of-the-art deep clustering methods. After fine-tuning the network with a limited amount of annotated data, SMAE achieves an identification accuracy of 83.90% on the test set, presenting competitive performance against the supervised ResNet (83.40%).

Abstract: We present the Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), a large language model (LLM) benchmark that measures the capability to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences.

Abstract: In recent years, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technology has attracted much attention in the related research field by virtue of its unique advantage of utilizing single meter data to achieve accurate decomposition of device-level energy consumption. Cutting-edge methods based on machine learning and deep learning have achieved remarkable results in load decomposition accuracy by fusing time-frequency domain features. However, these methods generally suffer from high computational costs and huge memory requirements, which become the main obstacles for their deployment on resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs). To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm in the time-frequency domain and systematically compares and analyzes the performance of six machine learning techniques in home electricity scenarios. Through complete experimental validation on edge MCUs, this scheme successfully achieves a recognition accuracy of 95%. Meanwhile, this study deeply optimizes the frequency domain feature extraction process, which effectively reduces the running time by 55.55% and the storage overhead by about 34.6%. The algorithm performance will be further optimized in future research work. Considering that the elimination of voltage transformer design can significantly reduce the cost, the subsequent research will focus on this direction, and is committed to providing more cost-effective solutions for the practical application of NILM, and providing a solid theoretical foundation and feasible technical paths for the design of efficient NILM systems in edge computing environments.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) data is crucial for diagnosing mental health conditions but is costly and time-consuming to collect at scale. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to augment datasets for machine learning applications. However, generating high-quality synthetic EEG that preserves emotional and mental health signals remains challenging. This study proposes a method combining correlation analysis and random sampling to generate realistic synthetic EEG data.
  We first analyze interdependencies between EEG frequency bands using correlation analysis. Guided by this structure, we generate synthetic samples via random sampling. Samples with high correlation to real data are retained and evaluated through distribution analysis and classification tasks. A Random Forest model trained to distinguish synthetic from real EEG performs at chance level, indicating high fidelity.
  The generated synthetic data closely match the statistical and structural properties of the original EEG, with similar correlation coefficients and no significant differences in PERMANOVA tests. This method provides a scalable, privacy-preserving approach for augmenting EEG datasets, enabling more efficient model training in mental health research.

Computational drug-target interaction prediction, a significant part of this process, can reduce these requirements by narrowing the search space for wet lab experiments. In this survey, we provide comprehensive details of graph machine learning-based methods in predicting drug-target interaction, as they have shown promising results in this field. These details include the overall framework, main contribution, datasets, and their source codes. The selected papers were mainly published from 2020 to 2024. Prior to discussing papers, we briefly introduce the datasets commonly used with these methods and measurements to assess their performance. Finally, future challenges and some crucial areas that need to be explored are discussed.

Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant computational challenges across fields ranging from quantum chemistry to economics and finance. Although scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques offer approximate solutions, they often suffer from bias and neglect crucial physical insights. Inspired by inference-time scaling strategies in language models, we propose Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a physics-informed framework that dynamically refines and debiases the SCiML predictions during inference by enforcing the physical laws. SCaSML leverages derived new physical laws that quantifies systematic errors and employs Monte Carlo solvers based on the Feynman-Kac and Elworthy-Bismut-Li formulas to dynamically correct the prediction. Both numerical and theoretical analysis confirms enhanced convergence rates via compute-optimal inference methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that SCaSML reduces errors by 20-50% compared to the base surrogate model, establishing it as the first algorithm to refine approximated solutions to high-dimensional PDE during inference. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.

Abstract: Area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC) is commonly reported alongside binary prediction models. However, there are concerns that AUC might be a misleading measure of prediction performance in the rare event setting. This setting is common since many events of clinical importance are rare events. We conducted a simulation study to determine when or whether AUC is unstable in the rare event setting. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether the bias and variance of AUC are driven by the number of events or the event rate. We also investigated the behavior of other commonly used measures of prediction performance, including positive predictive value, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results indicate that poor AUC behavior -- as measured by empirical bias, variability of cross-validated AUC estimates, and empirical coverage of confidence intervals -- is driven by the minimum class size, not event rate. Performance of sensitivity is driven by the number of events, while that of specificity is driven by the number of non-events. Other measures, including positive predictive value and accuracy, depend on the event rate even in large samples. AUC is reliable in the rare event setting provided that the total number of events is moderately large.

Abstract: We introduce FinNLI, a benchmark dataset for Financial Natural Language Inference (FinNLI) across diverse financial texts like SEC Filings, Annual Reports, and Earnings Call transcripts. Our dataset framework ensures diverse premise-hypothesis pairs while minimizing spurious correlations. FinNLI comprises 21,304 pairs, including a high-quality test set of 3,304 instances annotated by finance experts. Evaluations show that domain shift significantly degrades general-domain NLI performance. The highest Macro F1 scores for pre-trained (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) baselines are 74.57% and 78.62%, respectively, highlighting the dataset's difficulty. Surprisingly, instruction-tuned financial LLMs perform poorly, suggesting limited generalizability. FinNLI exposes weaknesses in current LLMs for financial reasoning, indicating room for improvement.

Abstract: The continuous improvement in weather forecast skill over the past several decades is largely due to the increasing quantity of available satellite observations and their assimilation into operational forecast systems. Assimilating these observations requires observation operators in the form of radiative transfer models. Significant efforts have been dedicated to enhancing the computational efficiency of these models. Computational cost remains a bottleneck, and a large fraction of available data goes unused for assimilation. To address this, we used machine learning to build an efficient neural network based probabilistic emulator of the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), applied to the GOES Advanced Baseline Imager. The trained NN emulator predicts brightness temperatures output by CRTM and the corresponding error with respect to CRTM. RMSE of the predicted brightness temperature is 0.3 K averaged across all channels. For clear sky conditions, the RMSE is less than 0.1 K for 9 out of 10 infrared channels. The error predictions are generally reliable across a wide range of conditions. Explainable AI methods demonstrate that the trained emulator reproduces the relevant physics, increasing confidence that the model will perform well when presented with new data.

Abstract: Edge computing-based Next-Generation Wireless Networks (NGWN)-IoT offer enhanced bandwidth capacity for large-scale service provisioning but remain vulnerable to evolving cyber threats. Existing intrusion detection and prevention methods provide limited security as adversaries continually adapt their attack strategies. We propose a dynamic attack detection and prevention approach to address this challenge. First, blockchain-based authentication uses the Deoxys Authentication Algorithm (DAA) to verify IoT device legitimacy before data transmission. Next, a bi-stage intrusion detection system is introduced: the first stage uses signature-based detection via an Improved Random Forest (IRF) algorithm. In contrast, the second stage applies feature-based anomaly detection using a Diffusion Convolution Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN). To ensure Quality of Service (QoS) and maintain Service Level Agreements (SLA), trust-aware service migration is performed using Heap-Based Optimization (HBO). Additionally, on-demand virtual High-Interaction honeypots deceive attackers and extract attack patterns, which are securely stored using the Bimodal Lattice Signature Scheme (BLISS) to enhance signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The proposed framework is implemented in the NS3 simulation environment and evaluated against existing methods across multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, attack detection rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, ROC curve, memory usage, CPU usage, and execution time. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, reinforcing the security of NGWN-enabled IoT ecosystems

Abstract: Federated learning has become a promising distributed learning concept with extra insurance on data privacy. Extensive studies on various models of Federated learning have been done since the coinage of its term. One of the important derivatives of federated learning is hierarchical semi-decentralized federated learning, which distributes the load of the aggregation task over multiple nodes and parallelizes the aggregation workload at the breadth of each level of the hierarchy. Various methods have also been proposed to perform inter-cluster and intra-cluster aggregation optimally. Most of the solutions, nonetheless, require monitoring the nodes' performance and resource consumption at each round, which necessitates frequently exchanging systematic data. To optimally perform distributed aggregation in SDFL with minimal reliance on systematic data, we propose Flag-Swap, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method that optimizes the aggregation placement according only to the processing delay. Our simulation results show that PSO-based placement can find the optimal placement relatively fast, even in scenarios with many clients as candidates for aggregation. Our real-world docker-based implementation of Flag-Swap over the recently emerged FL framework shows superior performance compared to black-box-based deterministic placement strategies, with about 43% minutes faster than random placement, and 32% minutes faster than uniform placement, in terms of total processing time.

Abstract: This study performs a comprehensive evaluation of quantitative measurements as extracted from automated deep-learning-based segmentation methods, beyond traditional Dice Similarity Coefficient assessments, focusing on six quantitative metrics, namely SUVmax, SUVmean, total lesion activity (TLA), tumor volume (TMTV), lesion count, and lesion spread. We analyzed 380 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT scans of patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, training deep neural networks, U-Net, Attention U-Net and SegResNet with four loss functions: Dice Loss, Dice Cross Entropy, Dice Focal Loss, and our proposed L1 weighted Dice Focal Loss (L1DFL). Evaluations indicated that Attention U-Net paired with L1DFL achieved the strongest correlation with the ground truth (concordance correlation = 0.90-0.99 for SUVmax and TLA), whereas models employing the Dice Loss and the other two compound losses, particularly with SegResNet, underperformed. Equivalence testing (TOST, alpha = 0.05, Delta = 20%) confirmed high performance for SUV metrics, lesion count and TLA, with L1DFL yielding the best performance. By contrast, tumor volume and lesion spread exhibited greater variability. Bland-Altman, Coverage Probability, and Total Deviation Index analyses further highlighted that our proposed L1DFL minimizes variability in quantification of the ground truth clinical measures. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ObedDzik/pca\_segment.git.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge platforms is challenged by their high computational and memory demands. Although recent low-bit quantization methods (e.g., BitNet, DeepSeek) compress weights to as little as 1.58 bits with minimal accuracy loss, edge deployment is still constrained by limited on-chip resources, power budgets, and the often-neglected latency of the prefill phase. We present TeLLMe, the first ternary LLM accelerator for low-power FPGAs (e.g., AMD KV260) that fully supports both prefill and autoregressive decoding using 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. Our contributions include: (1) a table-lookup matrix engine for ternary matmul that merges grouped activations with online precomputation to minimize resource use; (2) a fused, bandwidth-efficient attention module featuring a reversed reordering scheme to accelerate prefill; and (3) a tightly integrated normalization and quantization--dequantization unit optimized for ultra-low-bit inference. Under a 7W power budget, TeLLMe delivers up to 9 tokens/s throughput over 1,024-token contexts and prefill latencies of 0.55--1.15 s for 64--128 token prompts, marking a significant energy-efficiency advance and establishing a new edge FPGA benchmark for generative AI.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated superior performance in various fields, including natural language processing and computer vision. However, their enormous model size and high demands in computation, memory, and communication limit their deployment to edge platforms for local, secure inference. Binary transformers offer a compact, low-complexity solution for edge deployment with reduced bandwidth needs and acceptable accuracy. However, existing binary transformers perform inefficiently on current hardware due to the lack of binary specific optimizations. To address this, we introduce COBRA, an algorithm-architecture co-optimized binary Transformer accelerator for edge computing. COBRA features a real 1-bit binary multiplication unit, enabling matrix operations with -1, 0, and +1 values, surpassing ternary methods. With further hardware-friendly optimizations in the attention block, COBRA achieves up to 3,894.7 GOPS throughput and 448.7 GOPS/Watt energy efficiency on edge FPGAs, delivering a 311x energy efficiency improvement over GPUs and a 3.5x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art binary accelerator, with only negligible inference accuracy degradation.

Abstract: An important capacity in visual object recognition is invariance to image-altering variables which leave the identity of objects unchanged, such as lighting, rotation, and scale. How do neural networks achieve this? Prior mechanistic interpretability research has illuminated some invariance-building circuitry in InceptionV1, but the results are limited and networks with different architectures have remained largely unexplored. This work investigates ResNet18 with a particular focus on its residual stream, an architectural component which InceptionV1 lacks. We observe that many convolutional channels in intermediate blocks exhibit scale invariant properties, computed by the element-wise residual summation of scale equivariant representations: the block input's smaller-scale copy with the block pre-sum output's larger-scale copy. Through subsequent ablation experiments, we attempt to causally link these neural properties with scale-robust object recognition behavior. Our tentative findings suggest how the residual stream computes scale invariance and its possible role in behavior. Code is available at: https://github.com/cest-andre/residual-stream-interp

Abstract: Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) are critical for analyzing program execution and characterizing malware behavior. With the growing adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), CFG-based representations have proven highly effective for malware detection. This study proposes a novel framework that dynamically constructs CFGs and embeds node features using a hybrid approach combining rule-based encoding and autoencoder-based embedding. A GNN-based classifier is then constructed to detect malicious behavior from the resulting graph representations. To improve model interpretability, we apply state-of-the-art explainability techniques, including GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, and CaptumExplainer, the latter is utilized three attribution methods: Integrated Gradients, Guided Backpropagation, and Saliency. In addition, we introduce a novel aggregation method, called RankFusion, that integrates the outputs of the top-performing explainers to enhance the explanation quality. We also evaluate explanations using two subgraph extraction strategies, including the proposed Greedy Edge-wise Composition (GEC) method for improved structural coherence. A comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, fidelity, and consistency metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of accurate identification of malware samples and generating reliable and interpretable explanations.

Abstract: The 6-Degree of Freedom (DoF) grasp method based on point clouds has shown significant potential in enabling robots to grasp target objects. However, most existing methods are based on the point clouds (2.5D points) generated from single-view depth images. These point clouds only have one surface side of the object providing incomplete geometry information, which mislead the grasping algorithm to judge the shape of the target object, resulting in low grasping accuracy. Humans can accurately grasp objects from a single view by leveraging their geometry experience to estimate object shapes. Inspired by humans, we propose a novel 6-DoF grasping framework that converts the point completion results as object shape features to train the 6-DoF grasp network. Here, point completion can generate approximate complete points from the 2.5D points similar to the human geometry experience, and converting it as shape features is the way to utilize it to improve grasp efficiency. Furthermore, due to the gap between the network generation and actual execution, we integrate a score filter into our framework to select more executable grasp proposals for the real robot. This enables our method to maintain a high grasp quality in any camera viewpoint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that utilizing complete point features enables the generation of significantly more accurate grasp proposals and the inclusion of a score filter greatly enhances the credibility of real-world robot grasping. Our method achieves a 17.8\% success rate higher than the state-of-the-art method in real-world experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, a significant gap remains between their current performance and that of expert software engineers. A key differentiator is that human engineers actively seek clarification when faced with ambiguous requirements, while LLMs typically generate code regardless of uncertainties in the problem description. We present ClarifyCoder, a novel framework with synthetic data generation and instruction-tuning that enables LLMs to identify ambiguities and request clarification before proceeding with code generation. While recent work has focused on LLM-based agents for iterative code generation, we argue that the fundamental ability to recognize and query ambiguous requirements should be intrinsic to the models themselves. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) a data synthesis technique that augments existing programming datasets with scenarios requiring clarification to generate clarification-aware training data, and (2) a fine-tuning strategy that teaches models to prioritize seeking clarification over immediate code generation when faced with incomplete or ambiguous requirements. We further provide an empirical analysis of integrating ClarifyCoder with standard fine-tuning for a joint optimization of both clarify-awareness and coding ability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClarifyCoder significantly improves the communication capabilities of Code LLMs through meaningful clarification dialogues while maintaining code generation capabilities.

Abstract: The emergence of classical behavior from quantum mechanics as Planck's constant $\hbar$ approaches zero remains a fundamental challenge in physics [1-3]. This paper introduces a novel approach employing deep neural networks to directly learn the dynamical mapping from initial quantum state parameters (for Gaussian wave packets of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator) and $\hbar$ to the parameters of the time-evolved Wigner function in phase space [4-6]. A comprehensive dataset of analytically derived time-evolved Wigner functions was generated, and a deep feedforward neural network with an enhanced architecture was successfully trained for this prediction task, achieving a final training loss of ~ 0.0390. The network demonstrates a significant and previously unrealized ability to accurately capture the underlying mapping of the Wigner function dynamics. This allows for a direct emulation of the quantum-classical transition by predicting the evolution of phase-space distributions as $\hbar$ is systematically varied. The implications of these findings for providing a new computational lens on the emergence of classicality are discussed, highlighting the potential of this direct phase-space learning approach for studying fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics. This work presents a significant advancement beyond previous efforts that focused on learning observable mappings [7], offering a direct route via the phase-space representation.

<title>Property-Preserving Hashing for $\ell_1$-Distance Predicates: Applications to Countering Adversarial Input Attacks</title>

Abstract: Perceptual hashing is used to detect whether an input image is similar to a reference image with a variety of security applications. Recently, they have been shown to succumb to adversarial input attacks which make small imperceptible changes to the input image yet the hashing algorithm does not detect its similarity to the original image. Property-preserving hashing (PPH) is a recent construct in cryptography, which preserves some property (predicate) of its inputs in the hash domain. Researchers have so far shown constructions of PPH for Hamming distance predicates, which, for instance, outputs 1 if two inputs are within Hamming distance $t$. A key feature of PPH is its strong correctness guarantee, i.e., the probability that the predicate will not be correctly evaluated in the hash domain is negligible. Motivated by the use case of detecting similar images under adversarial setting, we propose the first PPH construction for an $\ell_1$-distance predicate. Roughly, this predicate checks if the two one-sided $\ell_1$-distances between two images are within a threshold $t$. Since many adversarial attacks use $\ell_2$-distance (related to $\ell_1$-distance) as the objective function to perturb the input image, by appropriately choosing the threshold $t$, we can force the attacker to add considerable noise to evade detection, and hence significantly deteriorate the image quality. Our proposed scheme is highly efficient, and runs in time $O(t^2)$. For grayscale images of size $28 \times 28$, we can evaluate the predicate in $0.0784$ seconds when pixel values are perturbed by up to $1 \%$. For larger RGB images of size $224 \times 224$, by dividing the image into 1,000 blocks, we achieve times of $0.0128$ seconds per block for $1 \%$ change, and up to $0.2641$ seconds per block for $14\%$ change.

Abstract: Graphical models are widely used in diverse application domains to model the conditional dependencies amongst a collection of random variables. In this paper, we consider settings where the graph structure is covariate-dependent, and investigate a deep neural network-based approach to estimate it. The method allows for flexible functional dependency on the covariate, and fits the data reasonably well in the absence of a Gaussianity assumption. Theoretical results with PAC guarantees are established for the method, under assumptions commonly used in an Empirical Risk Minimization framework. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several synthetic data settings and benchmarked against existing approaches. The method is further illustrated on real datasets involving data from neuroscience and finance, respectively, and produces interpretable results.

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to address heterogeneous client data distributions while preserving data privacy. However, when local client data is limited, deep learning models often suffer from insufficient training, leading to suboptimal performance. Foundation models, such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), exhibit strong feature extraction capabilities and can alleviate this issue by fine-tuning on limited local data. Despite their potential, foundation models are rarely utilized in federated learning scenarios, and challenges related to integrating new clients remain largely unresolved. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual Prompt Personalized Federated Learning (DP2FL) framework, which introduces dual prompts and an adaptive aggregation strategy. DP2FL combines global task awareness with local data-driven insights, enabling local models to achieve effective generalization while remaining adaptable to specific data distributions. Moreover, DP2FL introduces a global model that enables prediction on new data sources and seamlessly integrates newly added clients without requiring retraining. Experimental results in highly heterogeneous environments validate the effectiveness of DP2FL's prompt design and aggregation strategy, underscoring the advantages of prediction on novel data sources and demonstrating the seamless integration of new clients into the federated learning framework.

Abstract: We consider a collection of linear stochastic bandit problems, each modeling the random response of different agents to proposed interventions, coupled together by a global safety constraint. We assume a central coordinator must choose actions to play on each bandit with the objective of regret minimization, while also ensuring that the expected response of all agents satisfies the global safety constraints at each round, in spite of uncertainty about the bandits' parameters. The agents consider their observed responses to be private and in order to protect their sensitive information, the data sharing with the central coordinator is performed under local differential privacy (LDP). However, providing higher level of privacy to different agents would have consequences in terms of safety and regret. We formalize these tradeoffs by building on the notion of the sharpness of the safety set - a measure of how the geometric properties of the safe set affects the growth of regret - and propose a unilaterally unimprovable vector of privacy levels for different agents given a maximum regret budget.

<title>Circinus: Efficient Query Planner for Compound ML Serving</title>

Abstract: The rise of compound AI serving -- integrating multiple operators in a pipeline that may span edge and cloud tiers -- enables end-user applications such as autonomous driving, generative AI-powered meeting companions, and immersive gaming. Achieving high service goodput -- i.e., meeting service level objectives (SLOs) for pipeline latency, accuracy, and costs -- requires effective planning of operator placement, configuration, and resource allocation across infrastructure tiers. However, the diverse SLO requirements, varying edge capabilities, and high query volumes create an enormous planning search space, rendering current solutions fundamentally limited for real-time serving and cost-efficient deployments.
  This paper presents Circinus, an SLO-aware query planner for large-scale compound AI workloads. Circinus novelly decomposes multi-query planning and multi-dimensional SLO objectives while preserving global decision quality. By exploiting plan similarities within and across queries, it significantly reduces search steps. It further improves per-step efficiency with a precision-aware plan profiler that incrementally profiles and strategically applies early stopping based on imprecise estimates of plan performance. At scale, Circinus selects query-plan combinations to maximize global SLO goodput. Evaluations in real-world settings show that Circinus improves service goodput by 3.2-5.0$\times$, accelerates query planning by 4.2-5.8$\times$, achieving query response in seconds, while reducing deployment costs by 3.2-4.0$\times$ over state of the arts even in their intended single-tier deployments.

Abstract: Cattle lameness is often caused by hoof injuries or interdigital dermatitis, leads to pain and significantly impacts essential physiological activities such as walking, feeding, and drinking. This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.

Abstract: Malicious URLs persistently threaten the cybersecurity ecosystem, by either deceiving users into divulging private data or distributing harmful payloads to infiltrate host systems. Gaining timely insights into the current state of this ongoing battle holds significant importance. However, existing reviews exhibit 4 critical gaps: 1) Their reliance on algorithm-centric taxonomies obscures understanding of how detection approaches exploit specific modal information channels; 2) They fail to incorporate pivotal LLM/Transformer-based defenses; 3) No open-source implementations are collected to facilitate benchmarking; 4) Insufficient dataset coverage.This paper presents a comprehensive review of malicious URL detection technologies, systematically analyzing methods from traditional blacklisting to advanced deep learning approaches (e.g. Transformer, GNNs, and LLMs). Unlike prior surveys, we propose a novel modality-based taxonomy that categorizes existing works according to their primary data modalities (URL, HTML, Visual, etc.). This hierarchical classification enables both rigorous technical analysis and clear understanding of multimodal information utilization. Furthermore, to establish a profile of accessible datasets and address the lack of standardized benchmarking (where current studies often lack proper baseline comparisons), we curate and analyze: 1) publicly available datasets (2016-2024), and 2) open-source implementations from published works(2013-2025). Then, we outline essential design principles and architectural frameworks for product-level implementations. The review concludes by examining emerging challenges and proposing actionable directions for future research. We maintain a GitHub repository for ongoing curating datasets and open-source implementations: https://github.com/sevenolu7/Malicious-URL-Detection-Open-Source/tree/master.

<title>Seeking Flat Minima over Diverse Surrogates for Improved Adversarial Transferability: A Theoretical Framework and Algorithmic Instantiation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16474</link>

Abstract: The transfer-based black-box adversarial attack setting poses the challenge of crafting an adversarial example (AE) on known surrogate models that remain effective against unseen target models. Due to the practical importance of this task, numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge. However, most previous methods are heuristically designed and intuitively justified, lacking a theoretical foundation. To bridge this gap, we derive a novel transferability bound that offers provable guarantees for adversarial transferability. Our theoretical analysis has the advantages of \textit{(i)} deepening our understanding of previous methods by building a general attack framework and \textit{(ii)} providing guidance for designing an effective attack algorithm. Our theoretical results demonstrate that optimizing AEs toward flat minima over the surrogate model set, while controlling the surrogate-target model shift measured by the adversarial model discrepancy, yields a comprehensive guarantee for AE transferability. The results further lead to a general transfer-based attack framework, within which we observe that previous methods consider only partial factors contributing to the transferability. Algorithmically, inspired by our theoretical results, we first elaborately construct the surrogate model set in which models exhibit diverse adversarial vulnerabilities with respect to AEs to narrow an instantiated adversarial model discrepancy. Then, a \textit{model-Diversity-compatible Reverse Adversarial Perturbation} (DRAP) is generated to effectively promote the flatness of AEs over diverse surrogate models to improve transferability. Extensive experiments on NIPS2017 and CIFAR-10 datasets against various target models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack.

Abstract: The conversion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ into useful products such as methanol is a key strategy for abating climate change and our dependence on fossil fuels. Developing new catalysts for this process is costly and time-consuming and can thus benefit from computational exploration of possible active sites. However, this is complicated by the complexity of the materials and reaction networks. Here, we present a workflow for exploring transition states of elementary reaction steps at inverse catalysts, which is based on the training of a neural network-based machine learning interatomic potential. We focus on the crucial formate intermediate and its formation over nanoclusters of indium oxide supported on Cu(111). The speedup compared to an approach purely based on density functional theory allows us to probe a wide variety of active sites found at nanoclusters of different sizes and stoichiometries. Analysis of the obtained set of transition state geometries reveals different structure--activity trends at the edge or interior of the nanoclusters. Furthermore, the identified geometries allow for the breaking of linear scaling relations, which could be a key underlying reason for the excellent catalytic performance of inverse catalysts observed in experiments.

<title>Neuro-Evolutionary Approach to Physics-Aware Symbolic Regression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16503</link>

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a technique that can automatically derive analytic models from data. Traditionally, symbolic regression has been implemented primarily through genetic programming that evolves populations of candidate solutions sampled by genetic operators, crossover and mutation. More recently, neural networks have been employed to learn the entire analytical model, i.e., its structure and coefficients, using regularized gradient-based optimization. Although this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to premature convergence to suboptimal model structures. Here, we propose a neuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method that combines the strengths of evolutionary-based search for optimal neural network (NN) topologies with gradient-based tuning of the network's parameters. Due to the inherent high computational demand of evolutionary algorithms, it is not feasible to learn the parameters of every candidate NN topology to full convergence. Thus, our method employs a memory-based strategy and population perturbations to enhance exploitation and reduce the risk of being trapped in suboptimal NNs. In this way, each NN topology can be trained using only a short sequence of backpropagation iterations. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on three real-world test problems and has been shown to outperform other NN-based approaches regarding the quality of the models obtained.

Abstract: Streetscapes are an essential component of urban space. Their assessment is presently either limited to morphometric properties of their mass skeleton or requires labor-intensive qualitative evaluations of visually perceived qualities. This paper introduces SAGAI: Streetscape Analysis with Generative Artificial Intelligence, a modular workflow for scoring street-level urban scenes using open-access data and vision-language models. SAGAI integrates OpenStreetMap geometries, Google Street View imagery, and a lightweight version of the LLaVA model to generate structured spatial indicators from images via customizable natural language prompts. The pipeline includes an automated mapping module that aggregates visual scores at both the point and street levels, enabling direct cartographic interpretation. It operates without task-specific training or proprietary software dependencies, supporting scalable and interpretable analysis of urban environments. Two exploratory case studies in Nice and Vienna illustrate SAGAI's capacity to produce geospatial outputs from vision-language inference. The initial results show strong performance for binary urban-rural scene classification, moderate precision in commercial feature detection, and lower estimates, but still informative, of sidewalk width. Fully deployable by any user, SAGAI can be easily adapted to a wide range of urban research themes, such as walkability, safety, or urban design, through prompt modification alone.

<title>Confidence Sequences for Generalized Linear Models via Regret Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.16555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a methodology for constructing confidence sets for parameters of statistical models via a reduction to sequential prediction. Our key observation is that for any generalized linear model (GLM), one can construct an associated game of sequential probability assignment such that achieving low regret in the game implies a high-probability upper bound on the excess likelihood of the true parameter of the GLM. This allows us to develop a scheme that we call online-to-confidence-set conversions, which effectively reduces the problem of proving the desired statistical claim to an algorithmic question. We study two varieties of this conversion scheme: 1) analytical conversions that only require proving the existence of algorithms with low regret and provide confidence sets centered at the maximum-likelihood estimator 2) algorithmic conversions that actively leverage the output of the online algorithm to construct confidence sets (and may be centered at other, adaptively constructed point estimators). The resulting methodology recovers all state-of-the-art confidence set constructions within a single framework, and also provides several new types of confidence sets that were previously unknown in the literature.

<title>Data-Assimilated Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observed Chaotic Flows</title>

Abstract: The goal of many applications in energy and transport sectors is to control turbulent flows. However, because of chaotic dynamics and high dimensionality, the control of turbulent flows is exceedingly difficult. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods can discover optimal control policies by interacting with the environment, but they require full state information, which is often unavailable in experimental settings. We propose a data-assimilated model-based RL (DA-MBRL) framework for systems with partial observability and noisy measurements. Our framework employs a control-aware Echo State Network for data-driven prediction of the dynamics, and integrates data assimilation with an Ensemble Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation. An off-policy actor-critic algorithm is employed to learn optimal control strategies from state estimates. The framework is tested on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing a spatiotemporally chaotic flow from noisy and partial measurements.

Abstract: Packing objects efficiently is a fundamental problem in logistics, warehouse automation, and robotics. While traditional packing solutions focus on geometric optimization, packing irregular, 3D objects presents significant challenges due to variations in shape and stability. Reinforcement Learning~(RL) has gained popularity in robotic packing tasks, but training purely from simulation can be inefficient and computationally expensive. In this work, we propose HERB, a human-augmented RL framework for packing irregular objects. We first leverage human demonstrations to learn the best sequence of objects to pack, incorporating latent factors such as space optimization, stability, and object relationships that are difficult to model explicitly. Next, we train a placement algorithm that uses visual information to determine the optimal object positioning inside a packing container. Our approach is validated through extensive performance evaluations, analyzing both packing efficiency and latency. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world feasibility of our method on a robotic system. Experimental results show that our method outperforms geometric and purely RL-based approaches by leveraging human intuition, improving both packing robustness and adaptability. This work highlights the potential of combining human expertise-driven RL to tackle complex real-world packing challenges in robotic systems.

Abstract: Purpose: In this study, we investigate the training of foundation models using federated learning to address data-sharing limitations and enable collaborative model training without data transfer for minimally invasive surgery. Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to their integration across various fields, including password guessing, aiming to generate passwords that resemble human-created ones in complexity, structure, and patterns. Despite generative model's promise, inconsistencies in prior research and a lack of rigorous evaluation have hindered a comprehensive understanding of their true potential. In this paper, we introduce MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play password benchmarking framework. MAYA provides a standardized approach for evaluating generative password-guessing models through a rigorous set of advanced testing scenarios and a collection of eight real-life password datasets. Using MAYA, we comprehensively evaluate six state-of-the-art approaches, which have been re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization, for a total of over 15,000 hours of computation. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, models learn and generate different password distributions, enabling a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark password-generation techniques. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/williamcorrias/MAYA-Password-Benchmarking

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in robotic control but remains challenging due to high sample complexity, safety concerns, and the sim-to-real gap. While offline RL eliminates the need for risky real-world exploration by learning from pre-collected data, it suffers from distributional shift, limiting policy generalization. Model-Based RL (MBRL) addresses this by leveraging predictive models for synthetic rollouts, yet existing approaches often lack robust uncertainty estimation, leading to compounding errors in offline settings. We introduce Offline Robotic World Model (RWM-O), a model-based approach that explicitly estimates epistemic uncertainty to improve policy learning without reliance on a physics simulator. By integrating these uncertainty estimates into policy optimization, our approach penalizes unreliable transitions, reducing overfitting to model errors and enhancing stability. Experimental results show that RWM-O improves generalization and safety, enabling policy learning purely from real-world data and advancing scalable, data-efficient RL for robotics.

Abstract: While sugar beets are stored prior to processing, they lose sugar due to factors such as microorganisms present in adherent soil and excess vegetation. Their automated visual inspection promises to aide in quality assurance and thereby increase efficiency throughout the processing chain of sugar production. In this work, we present a novel high-quality annotated dataset and two-stage method for the detection, semantic segmentation and mass estimation of post-harvest and post-storage sugar beets in monocular RGB images. We conduct extensive ablation experiments for the detection of sugar beets and their fine-grained semantic segmentation regarding damages, rot, soil adhesion and excess vegetation. For these tasks, we evaluate multiple image sizes, model architectures and encoders, as well as the influence of environmental conditions. Our experiments show an mAP50-95 of 98.8 for sugar-beet detection and an mIoU of 64.0 for the best-performing segmentation model.

Abstract: Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.

Abstract: The complexities of healthcare data, including privacy concerns, imbalanced datasets, and interoperability issues, necessitate innovative machine learning solutions. Swarm Learning (SL), a decentralized alternative to Federated Learning, offers privacy-preserving distributed training, but its reliance on blockchain technology hinders accessibility and scalability. This paper introduces a \textit{Simplified Peer-to-Peer Swarm Learning (P2P-SL) Framework} tailored for resource-constrained environments. By eliminating blockchain dependencies and adopting lightweight peer-to-peer communication, the proposed framework ensures robust model synchronization while maintaining data privacy. Applied to cancer histopathology, the framework integrates optimized pre-trained models, such as TorchXRayVision, enhanced with DenseNet decoders, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's efficacy in handling imbalanced and biased datasets, achieving comparable performance to centralized models while preserving privacy. This study paves the way for democratizing advanced machine learning in healthcare, offering a scalable, accessible, and efficient solution for privacy-sensitive diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have significantly improved their ability to process long-context input, but practical applications are challenged by increased inference time and resource consumption, particularly in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose MOOSComp, a token-classification-based long-context compression method that enhances the performance of a BERT-based compressor by mitigating the over-smoothing problem and incorporating outlier scores. In the training phase, we add an inter-class cosine similarity loss term to penalize excessively similar token representations, thereby improving the token classification accuracy. During the compression phase, we introduce outlier scores to preserve rare but critical tokens that are prone to be discarded in task-agnostic compression. These scores are integrated with the classifier's output, making the compressor more generalizable to various tasks. Superior performance is achieved at various compression ratios on long-context understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, our method obtains a speedup of 3.3x at a 4x compression ratio on a resource-constrained mobile device.

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimaging provides complementary structural and functional insights into both human brain organization and disease-related dynamics. Recent studies demonstrate enhanced diagnostic sensitivity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) through synergistic integration of neuroimaging data (e.g., sMRI, fMRI) with behavioral cognitive scores tabular data biomarkers. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity across modalities (e.g., 4D spatiotemporal fMRI dynamics vs. 3D anatomical sMRI structure) presents critical challenges for discriminative feature fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose M2M-AlignNet: a geometry-aware multimodal co-attention network with latent alignment for early AD diagnosis using sMRI and fMRI. At the core of our approach is a multi-patch-to-multi-patch (M2M) contrastive loss function that quantifies and reduces representational discrepancies via geometry-weighted patch correspondence, explicitly aligning fMRI components across brain regions with their sMRI structural substrates without one-to-one constraints. Additionally, we propose a latent-as-query co-attention module to autonomously discover fusion patterns, circumventing modality prioritization biases while minimizing feature redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm the effectiveness of our method and highlight the correspondance between fMRI and sMRI as AD biomarkers.

Abstract: In science and social science, we often wish to explain why an outcome is different in two populations. For instance, if a jobs program benefits members of one city more than another, is that due to differences in program participants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given covariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool in econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two populations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship between covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be meaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear functional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates in one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these functional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not attribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given covariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions -- functional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to outcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We provide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a general property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid misattribution. We show that if the decomposition is independent of its input distribution, it does not misattribute. We further conjecture that misattribution arises in any reasonable additive decomposition that depends on the distribution of the covariates.

Abstract: To provide safety guarantees for learning-based control systems, recent work has developed formal verification methods to apply after training ends. However, if the trained policy does not meet the specifications, or there is conservatism in the verification algorithm, establishing these guarantees may not be possible. Instead, this work proposes to perform verification throughout training to ultimately aim for policies whose properties can be evaluated throughout runtime with lightweight, relaxed verification algorithms. The approach is to use differentiable reachability analysis and incorporate new components into the loss function. Numerical experiments on a quadrotor model and unicycle model highlight the ability of this approach to lead to learned control policies that satisfy desired reach-avoid and invariance specifications.

Abstract: The ability to make zero-shot predictions about the fitness consequences of protein sequence changes with pre-trained machine learning models enables many practical applications. Such models can be applied for downstream tasks like genetic variant interpretation and protein engineering without additional labeled data. The advent of capable protein structure prediction tools has led to the availability of orders of magnitude more precomputed predicted structures, giving rise to powerful structure-based fitness prediction models. Through our experiments, we assess several modeling choices for structure-based models and their effects on downstream fitness prediction. Zero-shot fitness prediction models can struggle to assess the fitness landscape within disordered regions of proteins, those that lack a fixed 3D structure. We confirm the importance of matching protein structures to fitness assays and find that predicted structures for disordered regions can be misleading and affect predictive performance. Lastly, we evaluate an additional structure-based model on the ProteinGym substitution benchmark and show that simple multi-modal ensembles are strong baselines.

Abstract: This paper presents our winning submission to the AI Mathematical Olympiad - Progress Prize 2 (AIMO-2) competition. Our recipe for building state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning models relies on three key pillars. First, we create a large-scale dataset comprising 540K unique high-quality math problems, including olympiad-level problems, and their 3.2M long-reasoning solutions. Second, we develop a novel method to integrate code execution with long reasoning models through iterative training, generation, and quality filtering, resulting in 1.7M high-quality Tool-Integrated Reasoning solutions. Third, we create a pipeline to train models to select the most promising solution from many candidates. We show that such generative solution selection (GenSelect) can significantly improve upon majority voting baseline. Combining these ideas, we train a series of models that achieve state-of-the-art results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research, we release our code, models, and the complete OpenMathReasoning dataset under a commercially permissive license.

Abstract: Decoding behavior, such as movement, from multiscale brain networks remains a central objective in neuroscience. Over the past decades, artificial intelligence and machine learning have played an increasingly significant role in elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying motor function. The advancement of brain-monitoring technologies, capable of capturing complex neuronal signals with high spatial and temporal resolution, necessitates the development and application of more sophisticated machine learning models for behavioral decoding. In this study, we employ a hybrid deep learning framework, an attention-based CNN-BiLSTM model, to decode skilled and complex forelimb movements using signals obtained from in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Our findings demonstrate that the intricate movements of both ipsilateral and contralateral forelimbs can be accurately decoded from unilateral M1 neuronal ensembles. These results highlight the efficacy of advanced hybrid deep learning models in capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies of neuronal networks activity linked to complex movement execution.

<title>Generalized Neighborhood Attention: Multi-dimensional Sparse Attention at the Speed of Light</title>

Abstract: Many sparse attention mechanisms such as Neighborhood Attention have typically failed to consistently deliver speedup over the self attention baseline. This is largely due to the level of complexity in attention infrastructure, and the rapid evolution of AI hardware architecture. At the same time, many state-of-the-art foundational models, particularly in computer vision, are heavily bound by attention, and need reliable sparsity to escape the O(n^2) complexity. In this paper, we study a class of promising sparse attention mechanisms that focus on locality, and aim to develop a better analytical model of their performance improvements. We first introduce Generalized Neighborhood Attention (GNA), which can describe sliding window, strided sliding window, and blocked attention. We then consider possible design choices in implementing these approaches, and create a simulator that can provide much more realistic speedup upper bounds for any given setting. Finally, we implement GNA on top of a state-of-the-art fused multi-headed attention (FMHA) kernel designed for the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture in CUTLASS. Our implementation can fully realize the maximum speedup theoretically possible in many perfectly block-sparse cases, and achieves an effective utilization of 1.3 petaFLOPs/second in FP16. In addition, we plug various GNA configurations into off-the-shelf generative models, such as Cosmos-7B, HunyuanVideo, and FLUX, and show that it can deliver 28% to 46% end-to-end speedup on B200 without any fine-tuning. We will open source our simulator and Blackwell kernels directly through the NATTEN project.

<title>Meta-Learning Online Dynamics Model Adaptation in Off-Road Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: High-speed off-road autonomous driving presents unique challenges due to complex, evolving terrain characteristics and the difficulty of accurately modeling terrain-vehicle interactions. While dynamics models used in model-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to generalize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose a novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme with meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning optimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the adaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard dynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale autonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline approaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the effectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the development of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and unseen environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that the prevailing approach to training and evaluating machine learning models often fails to consider their real-world application within organizational or societal contexts, where they are intended to create beneficial value for people. We propose a shift in perspective, redefining model assessment and selection to emphasize integration into workflows that combine machine predictions with human expertise, particularly in scenarios requiring human intervention for low-confidence predictions. Traditional metrics like accuracy and f-score fail to capture the beneficial value of models in such hybrid settings. To address this, we introduce a simple yet theoretically sound "value" metric that incorporates task-specific costs for correct predictions, errors, and rejections, offering a practical framework for real-world evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing metrics fail to capture real-world needs, often leading to suboptimal choices in terms of value when used to rank classifiers. Furthermore, we emphasize the critical role of calibration in determining model value, showing that simple, well-calibrated models can often outperform more complex models that are challenging to calibrate.

Abstract: Variational inference (VI) can be cast as an optimization problem in which the variational parameters are tuned to closely align a variational distribution with the true posterior. The optimization task can be approached through vanilla gradient descent in black-box VI or natural-gradient descent in natural-gradient VI. In this work, we reframe VI as the optimization of an objective that concerns probability distributions defined over a \textit{variational parameter space}. Subsequently, we propose Wasserstein gradient descent for tackling this optimization problem. Notably, the optimization techniques, namely black-box VI and natural-gradient VI, can be reinterpreted as specific instances of the proposed Wasserstein gradient descent. To enhance the efficiency of optimization, we develop practical methods for numerically solving the discrete gradient flows. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods through empirical experiments on a synthetic dataset, supplemented by theoretical analyses.

<title>Learning-augmented Online Minimization of Age of Information and Transmission Costs</title>

Abstract: We consider a discrete-time system where a resource-constrained source (e.g., a small sensor) transmits its time-sensitive data to a destination over a time-varying wireless channel. Each transmission incurs a fixed transmission cost (e.g., energy cost), and no transmission results in a staleness cost represented by the Age-of-Information. The source must balance the tradeoff between transmission and staleness costs. To address this challenge, we develop a robust online algorithm to minimize the sum of transmission and staleness costs, ensuring a worst-case performance guarantee. While online algorithms are robust, they are usually overly conservative and may have a poor average performance in typical scenarios. In contrast, by leveraging historical data and prediction models, machine learning (ML) algorithms perform well in average cases. However, they typically lack worst-case performance guarantees. To achieve the best of both worlds, we design a learning-augmented online algorithm that exhibits two desired properties: (i) consistency: closely approximating the optimal offline algorithm when the ML prediction is accurate and trusted; (ii) robustness: ensuring worst-case performance guarantee even ML predictions are inaccurate. Finally, we perform extensive simulations to show that our online algorithm performs well empirically and that our learning-augmented algorithm achieves both consistency and robustness.

<title>Sharp Bounds for Sequential Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data</title>

Abstract: There are two paradigms in Federated Learning (FL): parallel FL (PFL), where models are trained in a parallel manner across clients, and sequential FL (SFL), where models are trained in a sequential manner across clients. Specifically, in PFL, clients perform local updates independently and send the updated model parameters to a global server for aggregation; in SFL, one client starts its local updates only after receiving the model parameters from the previous client in the sequence. In contrast to that of PFL, the convergence theory of SFL on heterogeneous data is still lacking. To resolve the theoretical dilemma of SFL, we establish sharp convergence guarantees for SFL on heterogeneous data with both upper and lower bounds. Specifically, we derive the upper bounds for the strongly convex, general convex and non-convex objective functions, and construct the matching lower bounds for the strongly convex and general convex objective functions. Then, we compare the upper bounds of SFL with those of PFL, showing that SFL outperforms PFL on heterogeneous data (at least, when the level of heterogeneity is relatively high). Experimental results validate the counterintuitive theoretical finding.

Abstract: Various approaches have emerged for multi-armed bandits in distributed systems. The multiplayer dueling bandit problem, common in scenarios with only preference-based information like human feedback, introduces challenges related to controlling collaborative exploration of non-informative arm pairs, but has received little attention. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that the direct use of a Follow Your Leader black-box approach matches the lower bound for this setting when utilizing known dueling bandit algorithms as a foundation. Additionally, we analyze a message-passing fully distributed approach with a novel Condorcet-winner recommendation protocol, resulting in expedited exploration in many cases. Our experimental comparisons reveal that our multiplayer algorithms surpass single-player benchmark algorithms, underscoring their efficacy in addressing the nuanced challenges of the multiplayer dueling bandit setting.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with multivariant and probabilistically triggering arms (CMAB-MT), where the outcome of each arm is a $d$-dimensional multivariant random variable and the feedback follows a general arm triggering process. Compared with existing CMAB works, CMAB-MT not only enhances the modeling power but also allows improved results by leveraging distinct statistical properties for multivariant random variables. For CMAB-MT, we propose a general 1-norm multivariant and triggering probability-modulated smoothness condition, and an optimistic CUCB-MT algorithm built upon this condition. Our framework can include many important problems as applications, such as episodic reinforcement learning (RL) and probabilistic maximum coverage for goods distribution, all of which meet the above smoothness condition and achieve matching or improved regret bounds compared to existing works. Through our new framework, we build the first connection between the episodic RL and CMAB literature, by offering a new angle to solve the episodic RL through the lens of CMAB, which may encourage more interactions between these two important directions.

Abstract: The interaction of a protein with its environment can be understood and controlled via its 3D structure. Experimental methods for protein structure determination, such as X-ray crystallography or cryogenic electron microscopy, shed light on biological processes but introduce challenging inverse problems. Learning-based approaches have emerged as accurate and efficient methods to solve these inverse problems for 3D structure determination, but are specialized for a predefined type of measurement. Here, we introduce a versatile framework to turn biophysical measurements, such as cryo-EM density maps, into 3D atomic models. Our method combines a physics-based forward model of the measurement process with a pretrained generative model providing a task-agnostic, data-driven prior. Our method outperforms posterior sampling baselines on linear and non-linear inverse problems. In particular, it is the first diffusion-based method for refining atomic models from cryo-EM maps and building atomic models from sparse distance matrices.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) aims to learn effective representations across modalities for accurate predictions. Existing methods typically focus on modality consistency and specificity to learn effective representations. However, from a causal perspective, they may lead to representations that contain insufficient and unnecessary information. To address this, we propose that effective MML representations should be causally sufficient and necessary. Considering practical issues like spurious correlations and modality conflicts, we relax the exogeneity and monotonicity assumptions prevalent in prior works and explore the concepts specific to MML, i.e., Causal Complete Cause (\(C^3\)). We begin by defining \(C^3\), which quantifies the probability of representations being causally sufficient and necessary. We then discuss the identifiability of \(C^3\) and introduce an instrumental variable to support identifying \(C^3\) with non-exogeneity and non-monotonicity. Building on this, we conduct the $C^3$ measurement, i.e., \(C^3\) risk. We propose a twin network to estimate it through (i) the real-world branch: utilizing the instrumental variable for sufficiency, and (ii) the hypothetical-world branch: applying gradient-based counterfactual modeling for necessity. Theoretical analyses confirm its reliability. Based on these results, we propose $C^3$ Regularization, a plug-and-play method that enforces the causal completeness of the learned representations by minimizing \(C^3\) risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC), particularly neurosymbolic-based approaches, have demonstrated improved consistency and accuracy by enforcing constraints on a neural model during training. However, such work assumes the existence of such constraints a-priori. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and present an approach based on Error Detection Rules (EDR) that allow for learning explainable rules about the failure modes of machine learning models. We show that these rules are not only effective in detecting when a machine learning classifier has made an error but also can be leveraged as constraints for HMC, thereby allowing the recovery of explainable constraints even if they are not provided. We show that our approach is effective in detecting machine learning errors and recovering constraints, is noise tolerant, and can function as a source of knowledge for neurosymbolic models on multiple datasets, including a newly introduced military vehicle recognition dataset.

Abstract: As Deep Neural Networks have achieved thrilling breakthroughs in the past decade, data augmentations have garnered increasing attention as regularization techniques when massive labeled data are unavailable. Among existing augmentations, Mixup and relevant data-mixing methods that convexly combine selected samples and the corresponding labels are widely adopted because they yield high performances by generating data-dependent virtual data while easily migrating to various domains. This survey presents a comprehensive review of foundational mixup methods and their applications. We first elaborate on the training pipeline with mixup augmentations as a unified framework containing modules. A reformulated framework could contain various mixup methods and give intuitive operational procedures. Then, we systematically investigate the applications of mixup augmentations on vision downstream tasks, various data modalities, and some analysis \& theorems of mixup. Meanwhile, we conclude the current status and limitations of mixup research and point out further work for effective and efficient mixup augmentations. This survey can provide researchers with the current state of the art in mixup methods and provide some insights and guidance roles in the mixup arena. An online project with this survey is available at https://github.com/Westlake-AI/Awesome-Mixup.

Abstract: Forecasting the change in the distribution of viral variants is crucial for therapeutic design and disease surveillance. This task poses significant modeling challenges due to the sharp differences in virus distributions across sub-populations (e.g., countries) and their dynamic interactions. Existing machine learning approaches that model the variant distribution as a whole are incapable of making location-specific predictions and ignore transmissions that shape the viral landscape. In this paper, we propose a sub-population specific protein evolution model, which predicts the time-resolved distributions of viral proteins in different locations. The algorithm explicitly models the transmission rates between sub-populations and learns their interdependence from data. The change in protein distributions across all sub-populations is defined through a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) parametrized by transmission rates. Solving this ODE yields the likelihood of a given protein occurring in particular sub-populations. Multi-year evaluation on both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/H3N2 demonstrates that our model outperforms baselines in accurately predicting distributions of viral proteins across continents and countries. We also find that the transmission rates learned from data are consistent with the transmission pathways discovered by retrospective phylogenetic analysis.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks have shown great success in reinforcement learning, improving sample efficiency and generalization when there is symmetry in the task. However, in many problems, only approximate symmetry is present, which makes imposing exact symmetry inappropriate. Recently, approximately equivariant networks have been proposed for supervised classification and modeling physical systems. In this work, we develop approximately equivariant algorithms in reinforcement learning (RL). We define approximately equivariant MDPs and theoretically characterize the effect of approximate equivariance on the optimal $Q$ function. We propose novel RL architectures using relaxed group and steerable convolutions and experiment on several continuous control domains and stock trading with real financial data. Our results demonstrate that the approximately equivariant network performs on par with exactly equivariant networks when exact symmetries are present, and outperforms them when the domains exhibit approximate symmetry. As an added byproduct of these techniques, we observe increased robustness to noise at test time. Our code is available at https://github.com/jypark0/approx_equiv_rl.

Abstract: Polymeric nano- and micro-scale particles have critical roles in tackling critical healthcare and energy challenges with their miniature characteristics. However, tailoring their synthesis process to meet specific design targets has traditionally depended on domain expertise and costly trial-and-errors. Recently, modeling strategies, particularly Bayesian optimization (BO), have been proposed to aid materials discovery for maximized/minimized properties. Coming from practical demands, this study for the first time integrates constrained and composite Bayesian optimization (CCBO) to perform efficient target value optimization under black-box feasibility constraints and limited data for laboratory experimentation. Using a synthetic problem that simulates electrospraying, a model nanomanufacturing process, CCBO strategically avoided infeasible conditions and efficiently optimized particle production towards predefined size targets, surpassing standard BO pipelines and providing decisions comparable to human experts. Further laboratory experiments validated CCBO capability to guide the rational synthesis of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles with diameters of 300 nm and 3.0 $\mu$m via electrospraying. With minimal initial data and unknown experiment constraints, CCBO reached the design targets within 4 iterations. Overall, the CCBO approach presents a versatile and holistic optimization paradigm for next-generation target-driven particle synthesis empowered by artificial intelligence (AI).

While sentiment analysis has been extensively studied for languages like English, research in Bengali, remains limited, particularly for fine-grained sentiment categorization. This work aims to connect this gap by developing a novel approach that integrates rule-based algorithms with pre-trained language models. We developed a dataset from scratch, comprising over 15,000 manually labeled reviews. Next, we constructed a Lexicon Data Dictionary, assigning polarity scores to the reviews. We developed a novel rule based algorithm Bangla Sentiment Polarity Score (BSPS), an approach capable of generating sentiment scores and classifying reviews into nine distinct sentiment categories. To assess the performance of this method, we evaluated the classified sentiments using BanglaBERT, a pre-trained transformer-based language model. We also performed sentiment classification directly with BanglaBERT on the original data and evaluated this model's results. Our analysis revealed that the BSPS + BanglaBERT hybrid approach outperformed the standalone BanglaBERT model, achieving higher accuracy, precision, and nuanced classification across the nine sentiment categories. The results of our study emphasize the value and effectiveness of combining rule-based and pre-trained language model approaches for enhanced sentiment analysis in Bengali and suggest pathways for future research and application in languages with similar linguistic complexities.

<title>A Mapper Algorithm with implicit intervals and its optimization</title>

Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is an essential tool for visualizing complex, high dimensional data in topology data analysis (TDA) and has been widely used in biomedical research. It outputs a combinatorial graph whose structure implies the shape of the data. However,the need for manual parameter tuning and fixed intervals, along with fixed overlapping ratios may impede the performance of the standard Mapper algorithm. Variants of the standard Mapper algorithms have been developed to address these limitations, yet most of them still require manual tuning of parameters. Additionally, many of these variants, including the standard version found in the literature, were built within a deterministic framework and overlooked the uncertainty inherent in the data. To relax these limitations, in this work, we introduce a novel framework that implicitly represents intervals through a hidden assignment matrix, enabling automatic parameter optimization via stochastic gradient descent. In this work, we develop a soft Mapper framework based on a Gaussian mixture model(GMM) for flexible and implicit interval construction. We further illustrate the robustness of the soft Mapper algorithm by introducing the Mapper graph mode as a point estimation for the output graph. Moreover, a stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a specific topological loss function is proposed for optimizing parameters in the model. Both simulation and application studies demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the underlying topological structures. In addition, the application to an RNA expression dataset obtained from the Mount Sinai/JJ Peters VA Medical Center Brain Bank (MSBB) successfully identifies a distinct subgroup of Alzheimer's Disease.

Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from the other is available. However, these two aspects are often intertwined and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across various physical systems. We apply the model to several examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentrism, Newton's law of gravity, Schr\"odinger's wave mechanics, and Pauli's spin-magnetic formulation. The results demonstrate that the correct physical theories can emerge in the neural network.

Abstract: Tabular data poses unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature, combining both continuous and categorical variables. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively capture the underlying structure and relationships within such data. We propose GFTab (Geodesic Flow Kernels for Semi- Supervised Learning on Mixed-Variable Tabular Dataset), a semi-supervised framework specifically designed for tabular datasets. GFTab incorporates three key innovations: 1) Variable-specific corruption methods tailored to the distinct properties of continuous and categorical variables, 2) A Geodesic flow kernel based similarity measure to capture geometric changes between corrupted inputs, and 3) Tree-based embedding to leverage hierarchical relationships from available labeled data. To rigorously evaluate GFTab, we curate a comprehensive set of 21 tabular datasets spanning various domains, sizes, and variable compositions. Our experimental results show that GFTab outperforms existing ML/DL models across many of these datasets, particularly in settings with limited labeled data.

Abstract: The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes. However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.

Abstract: Given inputs of diverse soil characteristics and climate data gathered from various regions, we aimed to build a model to predict accurate land emissions. The problem is important since accurate quantification of the carbon cycle in agroecosystems is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.

Abstract: Traditional foundation models are pre-trained on broad datasets to reduce the training resources (e.g., time, energy, labeled samples) needed for fine-tuning a wide range of downstream tasks. However, traditional foundation models struggle with out-of-distribution prediction and can produce outputs that are unrealistic and physically infeasible. We propose the notation of physics-guided foundation models (PGFM), that is, foundation models integrated with broad or general domain (e.g., scientific) physical knowledge applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in data-driven approaches in physics, such as extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD). The EDMD algorithm focuses on nonlinear time-evolution systems, and the constructed Koopman matrix yields the next-time prediction with only linear matrix-product operations. Note that data-driven approaches generally require a large dataset. However, assume that one has some prior knowledge, even if it may be ambiguous. Then, one could achieve sufficient learning from only a small dataset by taking advantage of the prior knowledge. This paper yields methods for incorporating ambiguous prior knowledge into the EDMD algorithm. The ambiguous prior knowledge in this paper corresponds to the underlying time-evolution equations with unknown parameters. First, we apply the proposed method to forward problems, i.e., prediction tasks. Second, we propose a scheme to apply the proposed method to inverse problems, i.e., parameter estimation tasks. We demonstrate the learning with only a small dataset using guiding examples, i.e., the Duffing and the van der Pol systems.

<title>CF-CAM: Cluster Filter Class Activation Mapping for Reliable Gradient-Based Interpretability</title>

Abstract: As deep learning continues to advance, the transparency of neural network decision-making remains a critical challenge, limiting trust and applicability in high-stakes domains. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) techniques have emerged as a key approach toward visualizing model decisions, yet existing methods face inherent trade-offs. Gradient-based CAM variants suffer from sensitivity to gradient perturbations due to gradient noise, leading to unstable and unreliable explanations. Conversely, gradient-free approaches mitigate gradient instability but incur significant computational overhead and inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a Cluster Filter Class Activation Map (CF-CAM) technique, a novel framework that reintroduces gradient-based weighting while enhancing robustness against gradient noise. CF-CAM utilizes hierarchical importance weighting strategy to balance discriminative feature preservation and noise elimination. A density-aware channel clustering method via Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) groups semantically relevant feature channels and discard noise-prone activations. Additionally, cluster-conditioned gradient filtering leverages Gaussian filters to refine gradient signals, preserving edge-aware localization while suppressing noise impact. Experiment results demonstrate that CF-CAM achieves superior interpretability performance while enhancing computational efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art CAM methods in faithfulness and robustness. By effectively mitigating gradient instability without excessive computational cost, CF-CAM provides a competitive solution for enhancing the interpretability of deep neural networks in critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.

<title>Right Question is Already Half the Answer: Fully Unsupervised LLM Reasoning Incentivization</title>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in challenging tasks such as mathematical reasoning, existing methods to enhance reasoning ability predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL) on reasoning-specific data after pre-training. However, these approaches critically depend on external supervision--such as human-labelled reasoning traces, verified golden answers, or pre-trained reward models--which limits scalability and practical applicability. In this work, we propose Entropy Minimized Policy Optimization (EMPO), which makes an early attempt at fully unsupervised LLM reasoning incentivization. EMPO does not require any supervised information for incentivizing reasoning capabilities (i.e., neither verifiable reasoning traces, problems with golden answers, nor additional pre-trained reward models). By continuously minimizing the predictive entropy of LLMs on unlabeled user queries in a latent semantic space, EMPO enables purely self-supervised evolution of reasoning capabilities with strong flexibility and practicality. Our experiments demonstrate competitive performance of EMPO on both mathematical reasoning and free-form natural reasoning tasks. Specifically, without any supervised signals, \ours boosts the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Math-7B Base from 30.7\% to 48.1\% on mathematical benchmarks and improves the accuracy of Qwen2.5-7B Base from 32.1\% to 50.1\% on MMLU-Pro.

Abstract: We present a design called Proof of Gradient Optimization (PoGO) for blockchain consensus, where miners produce verifiable evidence of training large-scale machine-learning models. Building on previous work, we incorporate quantized gradients (4-bit precision) to reduce storage and computation requirements, while still preserving the ability of verifiers to check that real progress has been made on lowering the model's loss. Additionally, we employ Merkle proofs over the full 32-bit model to handle large parameter sets and to enable random leaf checks with minimal on-chain data. We illustrate these ideas using GPT-3 (175B parameters) as a reference example and also refer to smaller but high-performance models (e.g., Gemma~3 with 27B parameters). We provide an empirical cost analysis showing that verification is significantly cheaper than training, thanks in part to quantization and sampling. We also discuss the necessity of longer block times (potentially hours) when incorporating meaningful training steps, the trade-offs when using specialized GPU hardware, and how binary diffs may incrementally optimize updates. Finally, we note that fine-tuning can be handled in a similar manner, merely changing the dataset and the manner of sampling but preserving the overall verification flow. Our protocol allows verifiers to issue either positive or negative attestations; these are aggregated at finalization to either confirm the update or slash the miner.

Abstract: We show that, by using multiplicative weights in a game-theoretic thought experiment (and an important convexity result on the composition of multiplicative weights with the relative entropy function), a symmetric bimatrix game (that is, a bimatrix matrix wherein the payoff matrix of each player is the transpose of the payoff matrix of the other) either has an interior symmetric equilibrium or there is a pure strategy that is weakly dominated by some mixed strategy. Weakly dominated pure strategies can be detected and eliminated in polynomial time by solving a linear program. Furthermore, interior symmetric equilibria are a special case of a more general notion, namely, that of an "equalizer," which can also be computed efficiently in polynomial time by solving a linear program. An elegant "symmetrization method" of bimatrix games [Jurg et al., 1992] and the well-known PPAD-completeness results on equilibrium computation in bimatrix games [Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009] imply then the compelling P = PPAD.

Abstract: We revisit the use of spectral techniques to replaces the attention mechanism in Transformers through Fourier Transform based token mixing, and present a comprehensive and novel reformulation of this technique in next generation transformer models. We provide expanded literature context, detailed mathematical formulations of Fourier mixing and causal masking, and introduce a novel MultiDomain Fourier Wavelet Attention(MDFWA) that integrates frequency and time localized transforms to capture both global and local dependencies efficiently. We derive the complexity bounds, gradient formulas, and show that MDFWA achieves sub quadratic time and memory cost while improving expressive power. We validate our design on an abstractive summarization task using PubMed dataset, by enhancing the proposed approach with learned frequency bases, adaptive scale selection, and multi-modal extensions.

Abstract: We study complex-valued scaling as a type of symmetry natural and unique to complex-valued measurements and representations. Deep Complex Networks (DCN) extends real-valued algebra to the complex domain without addressing complex-valued scaling. SurReal takes a restrictive manifold view of complex numbers, adopting a distance metric to achieve complex-scaling invariance while losing rich complex-valued information. We analyze complex-valued scaling as a co-domain transformation and design novel equivariant and invariant neural network layer functions for this special transformation. We also propose novel complex-valued representations of RGB images, where complex-valued scaling indicates hue shift or correlated changes across color channels. Benchmarked on MSTAR, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN, our co-domain symmetric (CDS) classifiers deliver higher accuracy, better generalization, robustness to co-domain transformations, and lower model bias and variance than DCN and SurReal with far fewer parameters.

Abstract: Purpose: To present and evaluate Dafne (deep anatomical federated network), a freely available decentralized, collaborative deep learning system for the semantic segmentation of radiological images through federated incremental learning. Materials and Methods: Dafne is free software with a client-server architecture. The client side is an advanced user interface that applies the deep learning models stored on the server to the user's data and allows the user to check and refine the prediction. Incremental learning is then performed at the client's side and sent back to the server, where it is integrated into the root model. Dafne was evaluated locally, by assessing the performance gain across model generations on 38 MRI datasets of the lower legs, and through the analysis of real-world usage statistics (n = 639 use-cases). Results: Dafne demonstrated a statistically improvement in the accuracy of semantic segmentation over time (average increase of the Dice Similarity Coefficient by 0.007 points/generation on the local validation set, p < 0.001). Qualitatively, the models showed enhanced performance on various radiologic image types, including those not present in the initial training sets, indicating good model generalizability. Conclusion: Dafne showed improvement in segmentation quality over time, demonstrating potential for learning and generalization.

Abstract: Background: Identification of the interactions and regulatory relations between biomolecules play pivotal roles in understanding complex biological systems and the mechanisms underlying diverse biological functions. However, the collection of such molecular interactions has heavily relied on expert curation in the past, making it labor-intensive and time-consuming. To mitigate these challenges, we propose leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automate genome-scale extraction of this crucial knowledge.
  Results: In this study, we investigate the efficacy of various LLMs in addressing biological tasks, such as the recognition of protein interactions, identification of genes linked to pathways affected by low-dose radiation, and the delineation of gene regulatory relationships. Overall, the larger models exhibited superior performance, indicating their potential for specific tasks that involve the extraction of complex interactions among genes and proteins. Although these models possessed detailed information for distinct gene and protein groups, they faced challenges in identifying groups with diverse functions and in recognizing highly correlated gene regulatory relationships.
  Conclusions: By conducting a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art models using well-established molecular interaction and pathway databases, our study reveals that LLMs can identify genes/proteins associated with pathways of interest and predict their interactions to a certain extent. Furthermore, these models can provide important insights, marking a noteworthy stride toward advancing our understanding of biological systems through AI-assisted knowledge discovery.

Abstract: Community detection is one of the most critical problems in modern network science. Its applications can be found in various fields, from protein modeling to social network analysis. Recently, many papers appeared studying the problem of overlapping community detection, where each node of a network may belong to several communities. In this work, we consider Mixed-Membership Stochastic Block Model (MMSB) first proposed by Airoldi et al. MMSB provides quite a general setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The central question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities given an observed network. We compare different approaches and establish the minimax lower bound on the estimation error. Then, we propose a new estimator that matches this lower bound. Theoretical results are proved under fairly general conditions on the considered model. Finally, we illustrate the theory in a series of experiments.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.

Abstract: The advent of tiny artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators enables AI to run at the extreme edge, offering reduced latency, lower power cost, and improved privacy. When integrated into wearable devices, these accelerators open exciting opportunities, allowing various AI apps to run directly on the body. We present Synergy that provides AI apps with best-effort performance via system-driven holistic collaboration over AI accelerator-equipped wearables. To achieve this, Synergy provides device-agnostic programming interfaces to AI apps, giving the system visibility and controllability over the app's resource use. Then, Synergy maximizes the inference throughput of concurrent AI models by creating various execution plans for each app considering AI accelerator availability and intelligently selecting the best set of execution plans. Synergy further improves throughput by leveraging parallelization opportunities over multiple computation units. Our evaluations with 7 baselines and 8 models demonstrate that, on average, Synergy achieves a 23.0 times improvement in throughput, while reducing latency by 73.9% and power consumption by 15.8%, compared to the baselines.

Abstract: Brief hospital course (BHC) summaries are clinical documents that summarize a patient's hospital stay. While large language models (LLMs) depict remarkable capabilities in automating real-world tasks, their capabilities for healthcare applications such as synthesizing BHCs from clinical notes have not been shown. We introduce a novel pre-processed dataset, the MIMIC-IV-BHC, encapsulating clinical note and brief hospital course (BHC) pairs to adapt LLMs for BHC synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark of the summarization performance of two general-purpose LLMs and three healthcare-adapted LLMs. Using clinical notes as input, we apply prompting-based (using in-context learning) and fine-tuning-based adaptation strategies to three open-source LLMs (Clinical-T5-Large, Llama2-13B, FLAN-UL2) and two proprietary LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4). We evaluate these LLMs across multiple context-length inputs using natural language similarity metrics. We further conduct a clinical study with five clinicians, comparing clinician-written and LLM-generated BHCs across 30 samples, focusing on their potential to enhance clinical decision-making through improved summary quality. We observe that the Llama2-13B fine-tuned LLM outperforms other domain-adapted models given quantitative evaluation metrics of BLEU and BERT-Score. GPT-4 with in-context learning shows more robustness to increasing context lengths of clinical note inputs than fine-tuned Llama2-13B. Despite comparable quantitative metrics, the reader study depicts a significant preference for summaries generated by GPT-4 with in-context learning compared to both Llama2-13B fine-tuned summaries and the original summaries, highlighting the need for qualitative clinical evaluation.

Abstract: Debugging is a critical but challenging task for programmers. This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.

Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of applying deep learning to enhance software processing of radio frequency (RF) signals. In parallel, hardware developments with quantum RF sensors based on Rydberg atoms are breaking longstanding barriers in frequency range, resolution, and sensitivity. In this paper, we describe our implementations of quantum-ready machine learning approaches for RF signal classification. Our primary objective is latency: while deep learning offers a more powerful computational paradigm, it also traditionally incurs latency overheads that hinder wider scale deployment. Our work spans three axes. (1) A novel continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables flexible online classification of RF signals on-the-fly with reduced sampling time. (2) Low-latency inference techniques for both GPU and CPU that span over 100x reductions in inference time, enabling real-time operation with sub-millisecond inference. (3) Quantum-readiness validated through application of our models to physics-based simulation of Rydberg atom QRF sensors. Altogether, our work bridges towards next-generation RF sensors that use quantum technology to surpass previous physical limits, paired with latency-optimized AI/ML software that is suitable for real-time deployment.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the convergence of the Policy Iteration Algorithm (PIA) for a class of general continuous-time entropy-regularized stochastic control problems. In particular, instead of employing sophisticated PDE estimates for the iterative PDEs involved in the algorithm (see, e.g., Huang-Wang-Zhou(2025)), we shall provide a simple proof from scratch for the convergence of the PIA. Our approach builds on probabilistic representation formulae for solutions of PDEs and their derivatives. Moreover, in the finite horizon model and in the infinite horizon model with large discount factor, the similar arguments lead to a super-exponential rate of convergence without tear. Finally, with some extra efforts we show that our approach can be extended to the diffusion control case in the one dimensional setting, also with a super-exponential rate of convergence.

Abstract: In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) to generate music content, particularly lyrics, has gained in popularity. These advances provide valuable tools for artists and enhance their creative processes, but they also raise concerns about copyright violations, consumer satisfaction, and content spamming. Previous research has explored content detection in various domains. However, no work has focused on the text modality, lyrics, in music. To address this gap, we curated a diverse dataset of real and synthetic lyrics from multiple languages, music genres, and artists. The generation pipeline was validated using both humans and automated methods. We performed a thorough evaluation of existing synthetic text detection approaches on lyrics, a previously unexplored data type. We also investigated methods to adapt the best-performing features to lyrics through unsupervised domain adaptation. Following both music and industrial constraints, we examined how well these approaches generalize across languages, scale with data availability, handle multilingual language content, and perform on novel genres in few-shot settings. Our findings show promising results that could inform policy decisions around AI-generated music and enhance transparency for users.

<title>Lawma: The Power of Specialization for Legal Annotation</title>

Abstract: Annotation and classification of legal text are central components of empirical legal research. Traditionally, these tasks are often delegated to trained research assistants. Motivated by the advances in language modeling, empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to prompting commercial models, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation. Despite growing use, our understanding of how to best utilize large language models for legal annotation remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce CaselawQA, a benchmark comprising 260 legal annotation tasks, nearly all new to the machine learning community. We demonstrate that commercial models, such as GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, achieve non-trivial yet highly variable accuracy, generally falling short of the performance required for legal work. We then demonstrate that small, lightly fine-tuned models outperform commercial models. A few hundred to a thousand labeled examples are usually enough to achieve higher accuracy. Our work points to a viable alternative to the predominant practice of prompting commercial models. For concrete legal annotation tasks with some available labeled data, researchers are likely better off using a fine-tuned open-source model.

<title>Top Score on the Wrong Exam: On Benchmarking in Machine Learning for Vulnerability Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12986</link>

arXiv:2408.12986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to our survey of machine learning for vulnerability detection (ML4VD), 9 in every 10 papers published in the past five years define ML4VD as a function-level binary classification problem:
  Given a function, does it contain a security flaw?
  From our experience as security researchers, faced with deciding whether a given function makes the program vulnerable to attacks, we would often first want to understand the context in which this function is called.
  In this paper, we study how often this decision can really be made without further context and study both vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions in the most popular ML4VD datasets. We call a function "vulnerable" if it was involved in a patch of an actual security flaw and confirmed to cause the program's vulnerability. It is "non-vulnerable" otherwise. We find that in almost all cases this decision cannot be made without further context. Vulnerable functions are often vulnerable only because a corresponding vulnerability-inducing calling context exists while non-vulnerable functions would often be vulnerable if a corresponding context existed.
  But why do ML4VD techniques achieve high scores even though there is demonstrably not enough information in these samples? Spurious correlations: We find that high scores can be achieved even when only word counts are available. This shows that these datasets can be exploited to achieve high scores without actually detecting any security vulnerabilities.
  We conclude that the prevailing problem statement of ML4VD is ill-defined and call into question the internal validity of this growing body of work. Constructively, we call for more effective benchmarking methodologies to evaluate the true capabilities of ML4VD, propose alternative problem statements, and examine broader implications for the evaluation of machine learning and programming analysis research.

Abstract: Hallucination is a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), prevent ing their further application in some fields. The skeptical thinking of humankind
  could be useful for LLMs to self-cognition, self-reflection and alleviate their hal lucinations. Inspired by this consideration, we propose a novel approach called
  LaMsS, which combines the semantic understanding capability of LLMs with
  self-skepticism. By introducing a series of skepticism tokens and augmenting
  them into the vocabulary, we conduct both pertaining and finetuning, which allow
  the LLM to decode each normal token followed by a skeptical token, represent ing different skepticism levels. By calculating the response skepticism given a
  query, one can define a new self-aware LLM which is only willing to answer
  with relative lower skepticism level than the threshold. By examining the accu racy, AUC and AP of willingly answering questions, we demonstrate that LaMsS
  achieves better performance than baselines on both multi-choice questions and
  open-domain question-answering benchmarks, and can generalize to multi-task
  and out-of-domain settings. Our study sheds some lights on the self-skepticism
  modeling on further artificial intelligence. Project code and model checkpoints
  can be found in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SM-1E76.

<title>Building Real-time Awareness of Out-of-distribution in Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17277</link>

arXiv:2409.17277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in real-world environments. Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

<title>Attention Tracker: Detecting Prompt Injection Attacks in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs manipulate the model into ignoring original instructions and executing designated action. In this paper, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of these attacks by analyzing the attention patterns within LLMs. We introduce the concept of the distraction effect, where specific attention heads, termed important heads, shift focus from the original instruction to the injected instruction. Building on this discovery, we propose Attention Tracker, a training-free detection method that tracks attention patterns on instruction to detect prompt injection attacks without the need for additional LLM inference. Our method generalizes effectively across diverse models, datasets, and attack types, showing an AUROC improvement of up to 10.0% over existing methods, and performs well even on small LLMs. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach through extensive evaluations and provide insights into safeguarding LLM-integrated systems from prompt injection vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Building energy modeling plays a vital role in optimizing the operation of building energy systems by providing accurate predictions of the building's real-world conditions. In this context, various techniques have been explored, ranging from traditional physics-based models to data-driven models. Recently, researchers are combining physics-based and data-driven models into hybrid approaches. This includes using the physics-based model output as additional data-driven input, learning the residual between physics-based model and real data, learning a surrogate of the physics-based model, or fine-tuning a surrogate model with real data. However, a comprehensive comparison of the inherent advantages of these hybrid approaches is still missing. The primary objective of this work is to evaluate four predominant hybrid approaches in building energy modeling through a real-world case study, with focus on indoor thermodynamics. To achieve this, we devise three scenarios reflecting common levels of building documentation and sensor availability, assess their performance, and analyze their explainability using hierarchical Shapley values. The real-world study reveals three notable findings. First, greater building documentation and sensor availability lead to higher prediction accuracy for hybrid approaches. Second, the performance of hybrid approaches depends on the type of building room, but the residual approach using a Feedforward Neural Network as data-driven sub-model performs best on average across all rooms. This hybrid approach also demonstrates a superior ability to leverage the simulation from the physics-based sub-model. Third, hierarchical Shapley values prove to be an effective tool for explaining and improving hybrid models while accounting for input correlations.

Abstract: Question answering is a natural language understanding task that involves reasoning over both explicit context, and unstated relevant domain knowledge. Despite the high cost of training, large language models (LLMs) -- the backbone of most modern question-answering systems -- still struggle to reliably capture the nuanced relationships between concepts that are crucial for reasoning in specialized fields like medicine. In this work, we present MEG, a parameter-efficient approach for medical knowledge-augmented LLMs. MEG uses a lightweight mapping network to incorporate knowledge graph embeddings into the LLM, enabling it to leverage external knowledge in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on four popular medical multiple-choice datasets and show that LLMs i) can effectively interpret knowledge graph embeddings and ii) gain significant advantages from the factual grounding these embeddings provide. MEG attains an average of +6.7% and +9.9% accuracy over specialized models like BioMistral-7B and MediTron-7B, respectively. Finally, we show that MEG's performance remains robust to the choice of graph encoder.

<title>A Novel Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss for Enhancing Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness around the world and demands precise AI-based diagnostic tools. Traditional loss functions in multi-class classification, such as Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE), are very common but break down with class imbalance, especially in cases with inherently challenging or overlapping classes, which leads to biased and less sensitive models. Since a heavy imbalance exists in the number of examples for higher severity stage 4 diabetic retinopathy, etc., classes compared to those very early stages like class 0, achieving class balance is key. For this purpose, we propose the Adaptive Hybrid Focal-Entropy Loss which combines the ideas of focal loss and entropy loss with adaptive weighting in order to focus on minority classes and highlight the challenging samples. The state-of-the art models applied for diabetic retinopathy detection with AHFE revealed good performance improvements, indicating the top performances of ResNet50 at 99.79%, DenseNet121 at 98.86%, Xception at 98.92%, MobileNetV2 at 97.84%, and InceptionV3 at 93.62% accuracy. This sheds light into how AHFE promotes enhancement in AI-driven diagnostics for complex and imbalanced medical datasets.

Abstract: Economists often estimate treatment effects in experiments using remotely sensed variables (RSVs), e.g. satellite images or mobile phone activity, in place of directly measured economic outcomes. A common practice is to use an observational sample to train a predictor of the economic outcome from the RSV, and then to use its predictions as the outcomes in the experiment. We show that this method is biased whenever the RSV is post-outcome, i.e. if variation in the economic outcome causes variation in the RSV. In program evaluation, changes in poverty or environmental quality cause changes in satellite images, but not vice versa. As our main result, we nonparametrically identify the treatment effect by formalizing the intuition that underlies common practice: the conditional distribution of the RSV given the outcome and treatment is stable across the samples.Based on our identifying formula, we find that the efficient representation of RSVs for causal inference requires three predictions rather than one. Valid inference does not require any rate conditions on RSV predictions, justifying the use of complex deep learning algorithms with unknown statistical properties. We re-analyze the effect of an anti-poverty program in India using satellite images.

Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. This agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's action laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training and obtaining the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient and effective reinforcement learning algorithm following DeepSeek R1, to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to evolving data streams. A major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge will overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods usually retain the past data for replay or add additional branches in the model to learn new knowledge, which has high memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP), which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information, aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task. Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection. Extensive experiments on three CL datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves favorable performance across multiple metrics, showing its potential for advancing CL.

Abstract: Recommender systems have become a cornerstone of personalized user experiences, yet their development typically involves significant manual intervention, including dataset-specific feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and configuration. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm: Dataset-Agnostic Recommender Systems (DAReS) that aims to enable a single codebase to autonomously adapt to various datasets without the need for fine-tuning, for a given recommender system task. Central to this approach is the Dataset Description Language (DsDL), a structured format that provides metadata about the dataset's features and labels, and allow the system to understand dataset's characteristics, allowing it to autonomously manage processes like feature selection, missing values imputation, noise removal, and hyperparameter optimization. By reducing the need for domain-specific expertise and manual adjustments, DAReS offers a more efficient and scalable solution for building recommender systems across diverse application domains. It addresses critical challenges in the field, such as reusability, reproducibility, and accessibility for non-expert users or entry-level researchers.

Abstract: Learning robust and generalizable world models is crucial for enabling efficient and scalable robotic control in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.

<title>Rethinking Timing Residuals: Advancing PET Detectors with Explicit TOF Corrections</title>

Abstract: PET is a functional imaging method that visualizes metabolic processes. TOF information can be derived from coincident detector signals and incorporated into image reconstruction to enhance the SNR. PET detectors are typically assessed by their CTR, but timing performance is degraded by various factors. Research on timing calibration seeks to mitigate these degradations and restore accurate timing information. While many calibration methods use analytical approaches, machine learning techniques have recently gained attention due to their flexibility. We developed a residual physics-based calibration approach that combines prior domain knowledge with the power of machine learning models. This approach begins with an initial analytical calibration addressing first-order skews. The remaining deviations, regarded as residual effects, are used to train machine learning models to eliminate higher-order skews. The key advantage is that the experimenter guides the learning process through the definition of timing residuals. In earlier studies, we developed models that directly predicted the expected time difference, which offered corrections only implicitly (implicit correction models). In this study, we introduce a new definition for timing residuals, enabling us to train models that directly predict correction values (explicit correction models). The explicit correction approach significantly simplifies data acquisition, improves linearity, and enhances timing performance from $371 \pm 6$ ps to $281 \pm 5$ ps for coincidences from 430 keV to 590 keV. Additionally, the new definition reduces model size, making it suitable for high-throughput applications like PET scanners. Experiments were conducted using two detector stacks composed of $4 \times 4$ LYSO:Ce,Ca crystals ($3.8\times 3.8\times 20$ mm$^{3}$) coupled to $4 \times 4$ Broadcom NUV-MT SiPMs and digitized with the TOFPET2 ASIC.

Abstract: Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness. Results, methods, and limitations are detailed alongside discussion of promising extensions, emphasizing the potential of feature-rich mathematical/computational frameworks for natural and biomedical images.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become increasingly effective at approximating quantum mechanical calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, lower errors on held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during molecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and their performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to models failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The resulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks, including materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.

<title>Clinical QA 2.0: Multi-Task Learning for Answer Extraction and Categorization</title>

Abstract: Clinical Question Answering (CQA) plays a crucial role in medical decision-making, enabling physicians to extract relevant information from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). While transformer-based models such as BERT, BioBERT, and ClinicalBERT have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in CQA, existing models lack the ability to categorize extracted answers, which is critical for structured retrieval, content filtering, and medical decision support.
  To address this limitation, we introduce a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that jointly trains CQA models for both answer extraction and medical categorization. In addition to predicting answer spans, our model classifies responses into five standardized medical categories: Diagnosis, Medication, Symptoms, Procedure, and Lab Reports. This categorization enables more structured and interpretable outputs, making clinical QA models more useful in real-world healthcare settings.
  We evaluate our approach on emrQA, a large-scale dataset for medical question answering. Results show that MTL improves F1-score by 2.2% compared to standard fine-tuning, while achieving 90.7% accuracy in answer categorization. These findings suggest that MTL not only enhances CQA performance but also introduces an effective mechanism for categorization and structured medical information retrieval.

Abstract: Humans can accomplish complex contact-rich tasks using vision and touch, with highly reactive capabilities such as fast response to external changes and adaptive control of contact forces; however, this remains challenging for robots. Existing visual imitation learning (IL) approaches rely on action chunking to model complex behaviors, which lacks the ability to respond instantly to real-time tactile feedback during the chunk execution. Furthermore, most teleoperation systems struggle to provide fine-grained tactile / force feedback, which limits the range of tasks that can be performed. To address these challenges, we introduce TactAR, a low-cost teleoperation system that provides real-time tactile feedback through Augmented Reality (AR), along with Reactive Diffusion Policy (RDP), a novel slow-fast visual-tactile imitation learning algorithm for learning contact-rich manipulation skills. RDP employs a two-level hierarchy: (1) a slow latent diffusion policy for predicting high-level action chunks in latent space at low frequency, (2) a fast asymmetric tokenizer for closed-loop tactile feedback control at high frequency. This design enables both complex trajectory modeling and quick reactive behavior within a unified framework. Through extensive evaluation across three challenging contact-rich tasks, RDP significantly improves performance compared to state-of-the-art visual IL baselines. Furthermore, experiments show that RDP is applicable across different tactile / force sensors. Code and videos are available on https://reactive-diffusion-policy.github.io.

Abstract: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture. The code and datasets will be available at https://zeyuet.github.io/AudioX/

Abstract: In chip design planning, obtaining reliable performance and power forecasts for various design options is of critical importance. Traditionally, this involves using system-level models, which often lack accuracy, or trial synthesis, which is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. We introduce a new methodology, called Lorecast, which accepts English prompts as input to rapidly generate layout-aware performance and power estimates. This approach bypasses the need for HDL code development and synthesis, making it both fast and user-friendly. Experimental results demonstrate that Lorecast achieves accuracy within a few percent of error compared to post-layout analysis, while significantly reducing turnaround time.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a formulation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), based on learning the form of the Fourier decomposition, and a training methodology based on a spread of randomly chosen boundary conditions. By training in this way we produce a PINN that generalises; after training it can be used to correctly predict the solution for an arbitrary set of boundary conditions and interpolate this solution between the samples that spanned the training domain. We demonstrate for a toy system of two coupled oscillators that this gives the PINN formulation genuine predictive capability owing to an effective reduction of the training to evaluation times ratio due to this decoupling of the solution from specific boundary conditions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various code intelligence tasks. However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.

<title>MegaScale-Infer: Serving Mixture-of-Experts at Scale with Disaggregated Expert Parallelism</title>

arXiv:2504.02263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) showcases tremendous potential to scale large language models (LLMs) with enhanced performance and reduced computational complexity. However, its sparsely activated architecture shifts feed-forward networks (FFNs) from being compute-intensive to memory-intensive during inference, leading to substantially lower GPU utilization and increased operational costs. We present MegaScale-Infer, an efficient and cost-effective system for serving large-scale MoE models. MegaScale-Infer disaggregates attention and FFN modules within each model layer, enabling independent scaling, tailored parallelism strategies, and heterogeneous deployment for both modules. To fully exploit disaggregation in the presence of MoE's sparsity, MegaScale-Infer introduces ping-pong pipeline parallelism, which partitions a request batch into micro-batches and shuttles them between attention and FFNs for inference. Combined with distinct model parallelism for each module, MegaScale-Infer effectively hides communication overhead and maximizes GPU utilization. To adapt to disaggregated attention and FFN modules and minimize data transmission overhead (e.g., token dispatch), MegaScale-Infer provides a high-performance M2N communication library that eliminates unnecessary GPU-to-CPU data copies, group initialization overhead, and GPU synchronization. Experimental results indicate that MegaScale-Infer achieves up to 1.90x higher per-GPU throughput than state-of-the-art solutions.

Abstract: To track rapid changes within our water sector, Global Water Models (GWMs) need to realistically represent hydrologic systems' response patterns - such as baseflow fraction - but are hindered by their limited ability to learn from data. Here we introduce a high-resolution physics-embedded big-data-trained model as a breakthrough in reliably capturing characteristic hydrologic response patterns ('signatures') and their shifts. By realistically representing the long-term water balance, the model revealed widespread shifts - up to ~20% over 20 years - in fundamental green-blue-water partitioning and baseflow ratios worldwide. Shifts in these response patterns, previously considered static, contributed to increasing flood risks in northern mid-latitudes, heightening water supply stresses in southern subtropical regions, and declining freshwater inputs to many European estuaries, all with ecological implications. With more accurate simulations at monthly and daily scales than current operational systems, this next-generation model resolves large, nonlinear seasonal runoff responses to rainfall ('elasticity') and streamflow flashiness in semi-arid and arid regions. These metrics highlight regions with management challenges due to large water supply variability and high climate sensitivity, but also provide tools to forecast seasonal water availability. This capability newly enables global-scale models to deliver reliable and locally relevant insights for water management.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces a transformer model for early prediction of birth weight (BW), crucial for neonatal health. The model incorporates diverse maternal data like physiological, lifestyle, nutritional, and genetic factors, enhancing accuracy compared to existing models. Achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 122 grams and an R-squared value of 0.94, the model demonstrates high predictive accuracy and generalizability. It effectively classifies predicted BW into low and normal categories, facilitating early risk stratification with a high sensitivity and specificity. Interpretability is reinforced through feature importance and SHAP analyses, emphasizing the significant influences of maternal age, tobacco exposure, and vitamin B12 status on BW prediction, with genetic factors playing a secondary role. The findings highlight the potential of advanced deep-learning models for improving early BW prediction, offering clinicians a robust, interpretable, and personalized tool for identifying pregnancies at risk and optimizing neonatal outcomes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Birth weight (BW) is a key indicator of neonatal health, with low birth weight (LBW) linked to increased mortality and morbidity. Early prediction of BW enables timely interventions; however, current methods like ultrasonography have limitations, including reduced accuracy before 20 weeks and operator dependent variability. Existing models often neglect nutritional and genetic influences, focusing mainly on physiological and lifestyle factors. This study presents an attention-based transformer model with a multi-encoder architecture for early (less than 12 weeks of gestation) BW prediction. Our model effectively integrates diverse maternal data such as physiological, lifestyle, nutritional, and genetic, addressing limitations seen in prior attention-based models such as TabNet. The model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 122 grams and an R-squared value of 0.94, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and interoperability with our in-house private dataset. Independent validation confirms generalizability (MAE: 105 grams, R-squared: 0.95) with the IEEE children dataset. To enhance clinical utility, predicted BW is classified into low and normal categories, achieving a sensitivity of 97.55% and a specificity of 94.48%, facilitating early risk stratification. Model interpretability is reinforced through feature importance and SHAP analyses, highlighting significant influences of maternal age, tobacco exposure, and vitamin B12 status, with genetic factors playing a secondary role. Our results emphasize the potential of advanced deep-learning models to improve early BW prediction, offering clinicians a robust, interpretable, and personalized tool for identifying pregnancies at risk and optimizing neonatal outcomes.

Abstract: Despite the crucial role of inertial measurements in motion tracking and navigation systems, the time-consuming and resource-intensive nature of collecting extensive inertial data has hindered the development of robust machine learning models in this field. In recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a revolutionary class of generative models, reshaping the landscape of artificial data generation. These models surpass generative adversarial networks and other state-of-the-art approaches to complex tasks. In this work, we propose diffusion-driven specific force-generated data for smartphone location recognition. We provide a comprehensive evaluation methodology by comparing synthetic and real recorded specific force data across multiple metrics. Our results demonstrate that our diffusion-based generative model successfully captures the distinctive characteristics of specific force signals across different smartphone placement conditions. Thus, by creating diverse, realistic synthetic data, we can reduce the burden of extensive data collection while providing high-quality training data for machine learning models.

Abstract: This study introduces ReSA-ConvLSTM, an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for systematic bias correction in numerical weather prediction (NWP). We propose three innovations by integrating dynamic climatological normalization, ConvLSTM with temporal causality constraints, and residual self-attention mechanisms. The model establishes a physics-aware nonlinear mapping between ECMWF forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis data. Using 41 years (1981-2021) of global atmospheric data, the framework reduces systematic biases in 2-m air temperature (T2m), 10-m winds (U10/V10), and sea-level pressure (SLP), achieving up to 20% RMSE reduction over 1-7 day forecasts compared to operational ECMWF outputs. The lightweight architecture (10.6M parameters) enables efficient generalization to multiple variables and downstream applications, reducing retraining time by 85% for cross-variable correction while improving ocean model skill through bias-corrected boundary conditions. The ablation experiments demonstrate that our innovations significantly improve the model's correction performance, suggesting that incorporating variable characteristics into the model helps enhance forecasting skills.

<div> ODE, test-time fine-tuning, few-shot learning, cross-domain classification, Meta-Dataset benchmark <br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach for efficient test-time fine-tuning in few-shot learning scenarios by emulating gradient descent without actual gradient computations. By formulating gradient descent as an Euler discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), an auxiliary network is trained to predict task-specific drift using the few-shot support set. This enables test-time adaptation through simple numerical integration with only a few forward passes of the auxiliary network, eliminating the need for gradients or forward passes of the target model. Experimental results on Meta-Dataset and CDFSL benchmarks show significant improvement in out-of-domain performance compared to non-fine-tuned baseline, with substantially reduced memory cost (6%) and computation time (0.02%) in comparison to standard fine-tuning methods. This approach establishes a practical middle ground between direct transfer and fully fine-tuned approaches, offering an efficient solution for real-time or low-resource scenarios in few-shot learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While test-time fine-tuning is beneficial in few-shot learning, the need for multiple backpropagation steps can be prohibitively expensive in real-time or low-resource scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose an approach that emulates gradient descent without computing gradients, enabling efficient test-time adaptation. Specifically, we formulate gradient descent as an Euler discretization of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and train an auxiliary network to predict the task-conditional drift using only the few-shot support set. The adaptation then reduces to a simple numerical integration (e.g., via the Euler method), which requires only a few forward passes of the auxiliary network -- no gradients or forward passes of the target model are needed. In experiments on cross-domain few-shot classification using the Meta-Dataset and CDFSL benchmarks, our method significantly improves out-of-domain performance over the non-fine-tuned baseline while incurring only 6\% of the memory cost and 0.02\% of the computation time of standard fine-tuning, thus establishing a practical middle ground between direct transfer and fully fine-tuned approaches.

This work delves into the evaluation of agreement measures between classifiers, such as Cohen's kappa and intraclass correlation. These measures are essential in various fields, including medicine and artificial intelligence, to assess the efficacy of treatments and the performance of classifiers. The study introduces a method to determine the significance of agreement values between classifiers, proposing two indices for finite datasets and classification probability distributions. The manuscript also addresses the computational challenges involved in assessing these indices, highlighting the development of efficient algorithms for evaluation. It emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to evaluate the significance of agreement values rather than relying solely on numerical values, providing a more nuanced perspective on the quality of classifiers. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly naive, and their boundaries are arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript considers the computational issues of evaluating such indices and identifies some efficient algorithms to evaluate them.

<div> Keywords: Bayesian Federated Learning, uncertainty quantification, robust adaptation, continual learning, Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics<br />
Summary:<br />
This article introduces a new Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) framework that addresses the challenge of continual learning in dynamic environments where data distributions shift over time. The proposed approach utilizes Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to sequentially update the model, incorporating past posteriors to inform the prior for new tasks. The study evaluates the accuracy, expected calibration error (ECE), and convergence speed of the continual BFL framework compared to various baselines. Results demonstrate the efficacy of continual Bayesian updates in preserving knowledge and adapting to evolving data, particularly in the context of human sensing with radar data collected over several days. The framework offers insights into model reliability by estimating the posterior distribution of a global model, enabling uncertainty quantification and robust adaptation in distributed learning settings. <div>

Abstract: Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) enables uncertainty quantification and robust adaptation in distributed learning. In contrast to the frequentist approach, it estimates the posterior distribution of a global model, offering insights into model reliability. However, current BFL methods neglect continual learning challenges in dynamic environments where data distributions shift over time. We propose a continual BFL framework applied to human sensing with radar data collected over several days. Using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD), our approach sequentially updates the model, leveraging past posteriors to construct the prior for the new tasks. We assess the accuracy, the expected calibration error (ECE) and the convergence speed of our approach against several baselines. Results highlight the effectiveness of continual Bayesian updates in preserving knowledge and adapting to evolving data.

<div> Client sampling, update compression, communication bottleneck, FedFetch, federated learning

Summary:
Client sampling and update compression are common techniques used in federated learning to improve communication efficiency. However, when combined, they can lead to a bottleneck in the server-to-client communication due to clients having outdated local model states. To address this issue, FedFetch introduces an efficient prefetch schedule for clients to prefetch model states before a stated training round. Empirical results show that incorporating FedFetch into FL techniques reduces end-to-end training time by 1.26× and download time by 4.49× across compression techniques with heterogeneous client settings. The implementation of FedFetch is available on GitHub at https://github.com/DistributedML/FedFetch.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that facilitates massively distributed model training with end-user data on edge devices directed by a central server. However, the large number of heterogeneous clients in FL deployments leads to a communication bottleneck between the server and the clients. This bottleneck is made worse by straggling clients, any one of which will further slow down training. To tackle these challenges, researchers have proposed techniques like client sampling and update compression. These techniques work well in isolation but combine poorly in the downstream, server-to-client direction. This is because unselected clients have outdated local model states and need to synchronize these states with the server first.
  We introduce FedFetch, a strategy to mitigate the download time overhead caused by combining client sampling and compression techniques. FedFetch achieves this with an efficient prefetch schedule for clients to prefetch model states multiple rounds before a stated training round. We empirically show that adding FedFetch to communication efficient FL techniques reduces end-to-end training time by 1.26$\times$ and download time by 4.49$\times$ across compression techniques with heterogeneous client settings. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/DistributedML/FedFetch

<div> adaptation, video generative models, robotic behavior, natural language, generalization

Summary:
This research focuses on integrating in-domain information with large-scale pretrained video models to enable text-conditioned generalization for robotic tasks. While pretrained video models trained on internet-scale data understand natural language alignment, they may lack sensitivity to the specificities of a robot's environment. On the other hand, training on in-domain examples encodes environment-specific intricacies but may not support generalization through natural language specification. The study explores various adaptation techniques and introduces Inverse Probabilistic Adaptation, a novel strategy that shows strong generalization performance across different robotic environments. The strategy is robust to adaptation data quality and successfully solves novel tasks even with suboptimal in-domain demonstrations. Overall, the research demonstrates that adapting powerful video models with limited example data can facilitate generalization to new behaviors in robotic settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generative models demonstrate great promise in robotics by serving as visual planners or as policy supervisors. When pretrained on internet-scale data, such video models intimately understand alignment with natural language, and can thus facilitate generalization to novel downstream behavior through text-conditioning. However, they may not be sensitive to the specificities of the particular environment the agent inhabits. On the other hand, training video models on in-domain examples of robotic behavior naturally encodes environment-specific intricacies, but the scale of available demonstrations may not be sufficient to support generalization to unseen tasks via natural language specification. In this work, we investigate different adaptation techniques that integrate in-domain information with large-scale pretrained video models, and explore the extent to which they enable novel text-conditioned generalization for robotic tasks, while also considering their independent data and resource considerations. We successfully demonstrate across robotic environments that adapting powerful video models with small scales of example data can successfully facilitate generalization to novel behaviors. In particular, we present a novel adaptation strategy, termed Inverse Probabilistic Adaptation, that not only consistently achieves strong generalization performance across robotic tasks and settings, but also exhibits robustness to the quality of adaptation data, successfully solving novel tasks even when only suboptimal in-domain demonstrations are available.

The article discusses a learning-to-optimize (L2O) algorithm that utilizes parameter space symmetry to improve optimization efficiency. By jointly learning symmetry transformations and local updates, the algorithm shows enhanced meta-optimizer performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to software engineering (SE), where they are increasingly used in development workflows. However, their widespread use raises concerns about the presence and propagation of toxic language--harmful or offensive content that can foster exclusionary environments. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on toxicity detection and mitigation, focusing on both SE-specific and general-purpose datasets. We examine annotation and preprocessing techniques, assess detection methodologies, and evaluate mitigation strategies, particularly those leveraging LLMs. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-based rewriting for reducing toxicity. By synthesizing existing work and identifying open challenges, this review highlights key areas for future research to ensure the responsible deployment of LLMs in SE and beyond.

<div> Direct Preference Optimization, Large Language Models, Ranking, User Feedback, In-context Setting
Summary: 
The article introduces an In-context Ranking Preference Optimization (IRPO) framework for optimizing large language models based on ranking lists constructed during inference. IRPO addresses the challenge of limited and sparse pairwise feedback in the in-context setting, by incorporating both item relevance and position in the ranking list to optimize the model. The framework introduces a differentiable objective based on positional aggregation of pairwise item preferences, enabling effective gradient-based optimization of discrete ranking metrics. Theoretical insights show that IRPO automatically emphasizes items with greater disagreement between the model and the reference ranking, and its gradient is linked to an importance sampling estimator, resulting in reduced variance. Empirical results demonstrate that IRPO outperforms standard Direct Preference Optimization approaches in ranking performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in aligning large language models with direct in-context ranking preferences.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allow large language models (LLMs) to function as implicit ranking models by maximizing the margin between preferred and non-preferred responses. In practice, user feedback on such lists typically involves identifying a few relevant items in context rather than providing detailed pairwise comparisons for every possible item pair. Moreover, many complex information retrieval tasks, such as conversational agents and summarization systems, critically depend on ranking the highest-quality outputs at the top, emphasizing the need to support natural and flexible forms of user feedback. To address the challenge of limited and sparse pairwise feedback in the in-context setting, we propose an In-context Ranking Preference Optimization (IRPO) framework that directly optimizes LLMs based on ranking lists constructed during inference. To further capture flexible forms of feedback, IRPO extends the DPO objective by incorporating both the relevance of items and their positions in the list. Modeling these aspects jointly is non-trivial, as ranking metrics are inherently discrete and non-differentiable, making direct optimization difficult. To overcome this, IRPO introduces a differentiable objective based on positional aggregation of pairwise item preferences, enabling effective gradient-based optimization of discrete ranking metrics. We further provide theoretical insights showing that IRPO (i) automatically emphasizes items with greater disagreement between the model and the reference ranking, and (ii) links its gradient to an importance sampling estimator, yielding an unbiased estimator with reduced variance. Empirical results show IRPO outperforms standard DPO approaches in ranking performance, highlighting its effectiveness in aligning LLMs with direct in-context ranking preferences.

Summary:
Counterfactuals are challenging to create for computer vision models due to the production of adversarial examples by standard gradient-based methods. A new framework, Counterfactual Attacks, is introduced for generating counterfactual images by attacking the image representation along a low-dimensional manifold. This framework adapts to advances in generative modeling and can be accompanied by feature attribution from an auxiliary dataset, quantifying changes between the original and counterfactual images. These importance scores can be aggregated to provide global explanations of the features influencing model predictions. The method demonstrated efficacy with the MNIST and CelebA datasets, showcasing computational efficiency and flexibility in creating counterfactual explanations for machine learning models, particularly in the context of computer vision tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Counterfactuals are a popular framework for interpreting machine learning predictions. These what if explanations are notoriously challenging to create for computer vision models: standard gradient-based methods are prone to produce adversarial examples, in which imperceptible modifications to image pixels provoke large changes in predictions. We introduce a new, easy-to-implement framework for counterfactual images that can flexibly adapt to contemporary advances in generative modeling. Our method, Counterfactual Attacks, resembles an adversarial attack on the representation of the image along a low-dimensional manifold. In addition, given an auxiliary dataset of image descriptors, we show how to accompany counterfactuals with feature attribution that quantify the changes between the original and counterfactual images. These importance scores can be aggregated into global counterfactual explanations that highlight the overall features driving model predictions. While this unification is possible for any counterfactual method, it has particular computational efficiency for ours. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with the MNIST and CelebA datasets.

Summary:
In this study, the use of transfer learning (TL) with a 9-layer convolutional neural network (NN) is explored to predict subgrid forcing in a two-layer ocean quasi-geostrophic system. The study examines metrics for NN performance and generalizability to unseen dynamical regimes. Fourier analysis of NN kernels reveals the learning of low-pass, Gabor, and high-pass filters regardless of isotropic or anisotropic training data. By analyzing activation spectra, it is identified why NNs struggle to generalize without TL and how TL can address this issue. The study shows that re-training only one layer with target system data can correct underestimation of output spectra by learned weights and biases, resulting in accurate predictions. These findings have implications for data-driven parameterization of dynamical systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) is a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of neural networks (NNs) in applications such as weather and climate prediction and turbulence modeling. TL enables models to generalize to out-of-distribution data with minimal training data from the new system. In this study, we employ a 9-layer convolutional NN to predict the subgrid forcing in a two-layer ocean quasi-geostrophic system and examine which metrics best describe its performance and generalizability to unseen dynamical regimes. Fourier analysis of the NN kernels reveals that they learn low-pass, Gabor, and high-pass filters, regardless of whether the training data are isotropic or anisotropic. By analyzing the activation spectra, we identify why NNs fail to generalize without TL and how TL can overcome these limitations: the learned weights and biases from one dataset underestimate the out-of-distribution sample spectra as they pass through the network, leading to an underestimation of output spectra. By re-training only one layer with data from the target system, this underestimation is corrected, enabling the NN to produce predictions that match the target spectra. These findings are broadly applicable to data-driven parameterization of dynamical systems.

Abstract: This study proposes an algorithm for detecting suspicious behaviors in large payment flows based on deep generative models. By combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the algorithm is designed to detect abnormal behaviors in financial transactions. First, the GAN is used to generate simulated data that approximates normal payment flows. The discriminator identifies anomalous patterns in transactions, enabling the detection of potential fraud and money laundering behaviors. Second, a VAE is introduced to model the latent distribution of payment flows, ensuring that the generated data more closely resembles real transaction features, thus improving the model's detection accuracy. The method optimizes the generative capabilities of both GAN and VAE, ensuring that the model can effectively capture suspicious behaviors even in sparse data conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional machine learning algorithms and other deep learning models across various evaluation metrics, especially in detecting rare fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, this study provides a detailed comparison of performance in recognizing different transaction patterns (such as normal, money laundering, and fraud) in large payment flows, validating the advantages of generative models in handling complex financial data.

Summary:
The paper introduces FLFL-SSR, a federated latent factor learning (FLFL) based spatial signal recovery model for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The model addresses missing data issues caused by sensor failures and energy-saving strategies by implementing a sensor-level federated learning framework. This framework ensures data privacy by uploading only gradient updates instead of raw data for global model optimization. Additionally, a local spatial sharing strategy enables sensors in the same region to share latent feature vectors, improving recovery accuracy by capturing spatial correlations. Experimental results on real-world WSN datasets demonstrate superior recovery performance compared to existing federated methods. The FLFL-SSR model offers a promising solution for enhancing data recovery in WSNs while prioritizing data privacy protection.

arXiv:2504.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a cutting-edge domain in the field of intelligent sensing. Due to sensor failures and energy-saving strategies, the collected data often have massive missing data, hindering subsequent analysis and decision-making. Although Latent Factor Learning (LFL) has been proven effective in recovering missing data, it fails to sufficiently consider data privacy protection. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes a federated latent factor learning (FLFL) based spatial signal recovery (SSR) model, named FLFL-SSR. Its main idea is two-fold: 1) it designs a sensor-level federated learning framework, where each sensor uploads only gradient updates instead of raw data to optimize the global model, and 2) it proposes a local spatial sharing strategy, allowing sensors within the same spatial region to share their latent feature vectors, capturing spatial correlations and enhancing recovery accuracy. Experimental results on two real-world WSNs datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing federated methods in terms of recovery performance.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting chemical reactions is essential for driving innovation in synthetic chemistry, with broad applications in medicine, manufacturing, and agriculture. At the same time, reaction prediction is a complex problem which can be both time-consuming and resource-intensive for chemists to solve. Deep learning methods offer an appealing solution by enabling high-throughput reaction prediction. However, many existing models are trained on the US Patent Office dataset and treat reactions as overall transformations: mapping reactants directly to products with limited interpretability or mechanistic insight. To address this, we introduce PMechRP (Polar Mechanistic Reaction Predictor), a system that trains machine learning models on the PMechDB dataset, which represents reactions as polar elementary steps that capture electron flow and mechanistic detail. To further expand model coverage and improve generalization, we augment PMechDB with a diverse set of combinatorially generated reactions. We train and compare a range of machine learning models, including transformer-based, graph-based, and two-step siamese architectures. Our best-performing approach was a hybrid model, which combines a 5-ensemble of Chemformer models with a two-step Siamese framework to leverage the accuracy of transformer architectures, while filtering away "alchemical" products using the two-step network predictions. For evaluation, we use a test split of the PMechDB dataset and additionally curate a human benchmark dataset consisting of complete mechanistic pathways extracted from an organic chemistry textbook. Our hybrid model achieves a top-10 accuracy of 94.9% on the PMechDB test set and a target recovery rate of 84.9% on the pathway dataset.

Abstract: In medical imaging, anomaly detection is a vital element of healthcare diagnostics, especially for neurological conditions which can be life-threatening. Conventional deterministic methods often fall short when it comes to capturing the inherent uncertainty of anomaly detection tasks. This paper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection performance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation through Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and the findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper suggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly detection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing confidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to leverage in making medical decisions.

In this paper, the authors discuss the importance of calibration in machine learning predictors for decision-making. They highlight the differences between calibration errors for machine learning and decision-making, emphasizing that predictors with low calibration error in machine learning may not be trustworthy for decision-makers. The study investigates the effectiveness of post-processing a predictor with a low calibration error for machine learning to achieve a low calibration error for decision-making. The findings show that post-processing an online predictor with a certain distance to calibration can lead to asymptotically optimal Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Calibration Decision Loss (CDL). The post-processing algorithm involves adding noise to ensure differential privacy. However, the optimal bound achieved through post-processing is found to be non-optimal compared to existing online calibration algorithms that directly optimize for ECE and CDL.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Calibration requires predictor outputs to be consistent with their Bayesian posteriors. For machine learning predictors that do not distinguish between small perturbations, calibration errors are continuous in predictions, e.g., smooth calibration error (Foster and Hart, 2018), Distance to Calibration (Blasiok et al., 2023a). On the contrary, decision-makers who use predictions make optimal decisions discontinuously in probabilistic space, experiencing loss from miscalibration discontinuously. Calibration errors for decision-making are thus discontinuous, e.g., Expected Calibration Error (Foster and Vohra, 1997), and Calibration Decision Loss (Hu and Wu, 2024). Thus, predictors with a low calibration error for machine learning may suffer a high calibration error for decision-making, i.e., they may not be trustworthy for decision-makers optimizing assuming their predictions are correct. It is natural to ask if post-processing a predictor with a low calibration error for machine learning is without loss to achieve a low calibration error for decision-making. In our paper, we show that post-processing an online predictor with $\epsilon$ distance to calibration achieves $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ ECE and CDL, which is asymptotically optimal. The post-processing algorithm adds noise to make predictions differentially private. The optimal bound from low distance to calibration predictors from post-processing is non-optimal compared with existing online calibration algorithms that directly optimize for ECE and CDL.

Abstract: Molecular generation plays an important role in drug discovery and materials science, especially in data-scarce scenarios where traditional generative models often struggle to achieve satisfactory conditional generalization. To address this challenge, we propose MetaMolGen, a first-order meta-learning-based molecular generator designed for few-shot and property-conditioned molecular generation. MetaMolGen standardizes the distribution of graph motifs by mapping them to a normalized latent space, and employs a lightweight autoregressive sequence model to generate SMILES sequences that faithfully reflect the underlying molecular structure. In addition, it supports conditional generation of molecules with target properties through a learnable property projector integrated into the generative process.Experimental results demonstrate that MetaMolGen consistently generates valid and diverse SMILES sequences under low-data regimes, outperforming conventional baselines. This highlights its advantage in fast adaptation and efficient conditional generation for practical molecular design.

Summary: 
The study investigates the impact of the temperature parameter T in deep learning-based classification tasks, finding that the optimal temperature T* is determined by the feature dimensionality. Despite this theoretical grounding, practical conditions lead to fluctuations in T*, necessitating adjustments based on model, dataset, and other factors. The study proposes temperature determination coefficients and batch normalization to stabilize the feature space and develop an empirical formula for estimating T* without additional training. The formula is refined based on the number of classes and task complexity, proving effective in enhancing classification performance across various tasks. The derived temperature aligns with the theoretical perspective, offering a practical, training-free solution for determining T*. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In deep learning-based classification tasks, the softmax function's temperature parameter $T$ critically influences the output distribution and overall performance. This study presents a novel theoretical insight that the optimal temperature $T^*$ is uniquely determined by the dimensionality of the feature representations, thereby enabling training-free determination of $T^*$. Despite this theoretical grounding, empirical evidence reveals that $T^*$ fluctuates under practical conditions owing to variations in models, datasets, and other confounding factors. To address these influences, we propose and optimize a set of temperature determination coefficients that specify how $T^*$ should be adjusted based on the theoretical relationship to feature dimensionality. Additionally, we insert a batch normalization layer immediately before the output layer, effectively stabilizing the feature space. Building on these coefficients and a suite of large-scale experiments, we develop an empirical formula to estimate $T^*$ without additional training while also introducing a corrective scheme to refine $T^*$ based on the number of classes and task complexity. Our findings confirm that the derived temperature not only aligns with the proposed theoretical perspective but also generalizes effectively across diverse tasks, consistently enhancing classification performance and offering a practical, training-free solution for determining $T^*$.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel Tensorized Lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (TLGCN) to improve dynamic graph learning. The key concepts include a unique spatio-temporal information propagation method using a tensor M-product framework and a tensorized lightweight graph convolutional network that reduces memory usage by eliminating complex feature transformations and nonlinear activations. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the TLGCN outperforms existing models in weight estimation tasks on dynamic graphs. <div>
arXiv:2504.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic graph (DG) is frequently encountered in numerous real-world scenarios. Consequently, A dynamic graph convolutional network (DGCN) has been successfully applied to perform precise representation learning on a DG. However, conventional DGCNs typically consist of a static GCN coupled with a sequence neural network (SNN) to model spatial and temporal patterns separately. This decoupled modeling mechanism inherently disrupts the intricate spatio-temporal dependencies. To address the issue, this study proposes a novel Tensorized Lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (TLGCN) for accurate dynamic graph learning. It mainly contains the following two key concepts: a) designing a novel spatio-temporal information propagation method for joint propagation of spatio-temporal information based on the tensor M-product framework; b) proposing a tensorized lightweight graph convolutional network based on the above method, which significantly reduces the memory occupation of the model by omitting complex feature transformation and nonlinear activation. Numerical experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed TLGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art models in the weight estimation task on DGs.

<div> Decision Calibration, High-dimensional prediction, Nonlinear losses, Feature space, Sample complexity <br />
Summary: 
Decision-making based on model predictions often requires calibration to ensure optimal responses. Traditional calibration methods are computationally and statistically complex for high-dimensional outcomes. A new approach, decision calibration, reduces complexity but is limited to linear loss functions. Handling nonlinear losses by mapping outcomes to a feature space can lead to exponential dimensions. Verifying decision calibration already demands polynomial sample complexity in feature dimensions. A smooth version of decision calibration allows for dimension-free algorithms, applicable to various function classes. Efficient algorithms can post-process predictors to achieve decision calibration without sacrificing accuracy, utilizing separable Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). <div>
arXiv:2504.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When model predictions inform downstream decision making, a natural question is under what conditions can the decision-makers simply respond to the predictions as if they were the true outcomes. Calibration suffices to guarantee that simple best-response to predictions is optimal. However, calibration for high-dimensional prediction outcome spaces requires exponential computational and statistical complexity. The recent relaxation known as decision calibration ensures the optimality of the simple best-response rule while requiring only polynomial sample complexity in the dimension of outcomes. However, known results on calibration and decision calibration crucially rely on linear loss functions for establishing best-response optimality. A natural approach to handle nonlinear losses is to map outcomes $y$ into a feature space $\phi(y)$ of dimension $m$, then approximate losses with linear functions of $\phi(y)$. Unfortunately, even simple classes of nonlinear functions can demand exponentially large or infinite feature dimensions $m$. A key open problem is whether it is possible to achieve decision calibration with sample complexity independent of~$m$. We begin with a negative result: even verifying decision calibration under standard deterministic best response inherently requires sample complexity polynomial in~$m$. Motivated by this lower bound, we investigate a smooth version of decision calibration in which decision-makers follow a smooth best-response. This smooth relaxation enables dimension-free decision calibration algorithms. We introduce algorithms that, given $\mathrm{poly}(|A|,1/\epsilon)$ samples and any initial predictor~$p$, can efficiently post-process it to satisfy decision calibration without worsening accuracy. Our algorithms apply broadly to function classes that can be well-approximated by bounded-norm functions in (possibly infinite-dimensional) separable RKHS.

Summary: 
The article introduces SocialMOIF, a multi-order intention fusion model designed to improve trajectory forecasting in intelligent systems. It focuses on capturing both direct and indirect intention interactions among neighboring groups, addressing the limitations of existing models due to high uncertainty and complex influences. By incorporating a trajectory distribution approximator and a global trajectory optimizer, SocialMOIF enhances model interpretability and prediction accuracy. A novel loss function considers distance and direction during training, leading to superior performance compared to previous baselines in dynamic and static datasets. This approach represents a significant advancement in understanding and predicting agent trajectories, with implications for a wide range of applications in decision-making processes.

arXiv:2504.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis and prediction of agent trajectories are crucial for decision-making processes in intelligent systems, with precise short-term trajectory forecasting being highly significant across a range of applications. Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.

Summary:
The paper proposes a novel physics-informed generative learning approach called RadioDiff-$\bm{k^2}$ for accurate and efficient construction of radio maps (RMs). With the evolution of wireless communication towards environment-aware paradigms in 6G networks, the accurate construction of RMs is crucial yet challenging. Existing methods have limitations in adaptability and computational overhead. The proposed approach combines data-driven methods with physics-based modeling, guided by the Helmholtz equation governing electromagnetic wave propagation. By identifying the correspondence between EM singularities and negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation, a dual generative diffusion model framework is designed to accurately infer EM singularities and reconstruct RMs. This innovative approach enhances RM accuracy, particularly in complex multipath environments, offering a balance between efficiency and physics-based modeling. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed generative learning approach, termed RadioDiff-$\bm{k^2}$, for accurate and efficient multipath-aware radio map (RM) construction. As wireless communication evolves towards environment-aware paradigms, driven by the increasing demand for intelligent and proactive optimization in sixth-generation (6G) networks, accurate construction of RMs becomes crucial yet highly challenging. Conventional electromagnetic (EM)-based methods, such as full-wave solvers and ray-tracing approaches, exhibit substantial computational overhead and limited adaptability to dynamic scenarios. Although, existing neural network (NN) approaches have efficient inferencing speed, they lack sufficient consideration of the underlying physics of EM wave propagation, limiting their effectiveness in accurately modeling critical EM singularities induced by complex multipath environments. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel physics-inspired RM construction method guided explicitly by the Helmholtz equation, which inherently governs EM wave propagation. Specifically, we theoretically establish a direct correspondence between EM singularities, which correspond to the critical spatial features influencing wireless propagation, and regions defined by negative wave numbers in the Helmholtz equation. Based on this insight, we design an innovative dual generative diffusion model (DM) framework comprising one DM dedicated to accurately inferring EM singularities and another DM responsible for reconstructing the complete RM using these singularities along with environmental contextual information. Our physics-informed approach uniquely combines the efficiency advantages of data-driven methods with rigorous physics-based EM modeling, significantly enhancing RM accuracy, particularly in complex propagation environments dominated by multipath effects.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have recently propelled advances in sequence modeling across domains, but their application to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (H-P) model for protein folding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we adapt a Deep Q-Network (DQN) integrated with attention mechanisms (Transformers) to address the 3D H-P protein folding problem. Our system formulates folding decisions as a self-avoiding walk in a reinforced environment, and employs a specialized reward function based on favorable hydrophobic interactions. To improve performance, the method incorporates validity check including symmetry-breaking constraints, dueling and double Q-learning, and prioritized replay to focus learning on critical transitions. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmark sequences demonstrate that our approach achieves several known best solutions for shorter sequences, and obtains near-optimal results for longer chains. This study underscores the promise of attention-based reinforcement learning for protein folding, and created a prototype of Transformer-based Q-network structure for 3-dimensional lattice models.

Abstract: Machine learning models tend to learn spurious features - features that strongly correlate with target labels but are not causal. Existing approaches to mitigate models' dependence on spurious features work in some cases, but fail in others. In this paper, we systematically analyze how and where neural networks encode spurious correlations. We introduce the neuron spurious score, an XAI-based diagnostic measure to quantify a neuron's dependence on spurious features. We analyze both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) using architecture-specific methods. Our results show that spurious features are partially disentangled, but the degree of disentanglement varies across model architectures. Furthermore, we find that the assumptions behind existing mitigation methods are incomplete. Our results lay the groundwork for the development of novel methods to mitigate spurious correlations and make AI models safer to use in practice.

Abstract: Invariant learning is a promising approach to improve domain generalization compared to Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). However, most invariant learning methods rely on the assumption that training examples are pre-partitioned into different known environments. We instead infer environments without the need for additional annotations, motivated by observations of the properties within the representation space of a trained ERM model. We show the preliminary effectiveness of our approach on the ColoredMNIST benchmark, achieving performance comparable to methods requiring explicit environment labels and on par with an annotation-free method that poses strong restrictions on the ERM reference model.

<br />Summary: Stochastic interpolants have been widely used in Euclidean space but are limited when dealing with distribution learning on Riemannian manifolds. This work introduces the Riemannian Neural Geodesic Interpolant (RNGI) model that interpolates between probability densities on a Riemannian manifold along stochastic geodesics. The model's temporal marginal density solves a transport equation on the manifold. The Embedding Stochastic Differential Equation (E-SDE) algorithm is proposed for stochastic sampling of RNGI, improving sampling quality by reducing error accumulation from intrinsic discretization. The experimental results on S2 and SO(3) demonstrate the effectiveness of RNGI and E-SDE in generating samples from collected and synthetic distributions. Theoretical bounds on generative bias are also provided in terms of KL-divergence. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic interpolants are efficient generative models that bridge two arbitrary probability density functions in finite time, enabling flexible generation from the source to the target distribution or vice versa. These models are primarily developed in Euclidean space, and are therefore limited in their application to many distribution learning problems defined on Riemannian manifolds in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce the Riemannian Neural Geodesic Interpolant (RNGI) model, which interpolates between two probability densities on a Riemannian manifold along the stochastic geodesics, and then samples from one endpoint as the final state using the continuous flow originating from the other endpoint. We prove that the temporal marginal density of RNGI solves a transport equation on the Riemannian manifold. After training the model's the neural velocity and score fields, we propose the Embedding Stochastic Differential Equation (E-SDE) algorithm for stochastic sampling of RNGI. E-SDE significantly improves the sampling quality by reducing the accumulated error caused by the excessive intrinsic discretization of Riemannian Brownian motion in the classical Geodesic Random Walk (GRW) algorithm. We also provide theoretical bounds on the generative bias measured in terms of KL-divergence. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RNGI and E-SDE through experiments conducted on both collected and synthetic distributions on S2 and SO(3).

Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.

This paper introduces Clifford Diffusion Models (CDMs) for $\E(n)$-equivariant diffusion models, leveraging the expressive power of Clifford algebra. By utilizing geometric products between Clifford multivectors, CDMs extend the diffusion process to incorporate higher-grade multivector subspaces, allowing for latent diffusion across complete multivectors. This approach enables capturing joint distributions across different subspaces of the algebra, incorporating richer geometric information through higher-order features. Empirical results on the QM9 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CDMs in unconditional molecular generation, showcasing their potential in generative modeling. <div>

Abstract: This paper explores leveraging the Clifford algebra's expressive power for $\E(n)$-equivariant diffusion models. We utilize the geometric products between Clifford multivectors and the rich geometric information encoded in Clifford subspaces in \emph{Clifford Diffusion Models} (CDMs). We extend the diffusion process beyond just Clifford one-vectors to incorporate all higher-grade multivector subspaces. The data is embedded in grade-$k$ subspaces, allowing us to apply latent diffusion across complete multivectors. This enables CDMs to capture the joint distribution across different subspaces of the algebra, incorporating richer geometric information through higher-order features. We provide empirical results for unconditional molecular generation on the QM9 dataset, showing that CDMs provide a promising avenue for generative modeling.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) due to their superior function-fitting abilities in data-driven modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DAE-KAN, for solving high-index differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by integrating KANs with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). This framework not only preserves the ability of traditional PINNs to model complex systems governed by physical laws but also enhances their performance by leveraging the function-fitting strengths of KANs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that for DAE systems ranging from index-1 to index-3, DAE-KAN reduces the absolute errors of both differential and algebraic variables by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to traditional PINNs. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we analyze the drift-off error and find that both PINNs and DAE-KAN outperform classical numerical methods in controlling this phenomenon. Our results highlight the potential of neural network methods, particularly DAE-KAN, in solving high-index DAEs with substantial computational accuracy and generalization, offering a promising solution for challenging partial differential-algebraic equations.

<br />
Summary: 
This paper examines the fusion of absolute and relative feedback in stochastic bandits, where both types of feedback are collected in each decision round. A regret lower bound is derived, showing that an efficient algorithm may only incur the smaller regret between reward and dueling-based feedback for each arm. Two fusion approaches are proposed: elimination fusion and decomposition fusion. The elimination fusion algorithm explores all arms using both feedback types, while the decomposition fusion algorithm selects the more effective feedback for exploration and exploitation. The elimination fusion has suboptimal regret due to the inherent limitations of dueling elimination, while the decomposition fusion matches the lower bound under a common assumption. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the algorithms and theoretical findings. <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the fusion of absolute (reward) and relative (dueling) feedback in stochastic bandits, where both feedback types are gathered in each decision round. We derive a regret lower bound, demonstrating that an efficient algorithm may incur only the smaller among the reward and dueling-based regret for each individual arm. We propose two fusion approaches: (1) a simple elimination fusion algorithm that leverages both feedback types to explore all arms and unifies collected information by sharing a common candidate arm set, and (2) a decomposition fusion algorithm that selects the more effective feedback to explore the corresponding arms and randomly assigns one feedback type for exploration and the other for exploitation in each round. The elimination fusion experiences a suboptimal multiplicative term of the number of arms in regret due to the intrinsic suboptimality of dueling elimination. In contrast, the decomposition fusion achieves regret matching the lower bound up to a constant under a common assumption. Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of our algorithms and theoretical results.

Summary: 
An adaptive outlier detection algorithm is proposed for analyzing multi-featured time series data in space missions. The algorithm, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reconstruction error, efficiently detects regions of interest in real time, crucial for automatic event detection onboard. By utilizing Incremental PCA, it dynamically adjusts to changing data distributions without a predefined model.

Abstract: Analyzing multi-featured time series data is critical for space missions making efficient event detection, potentially onboard, essential for automatic analysis. However, limited onboard computational resources and data downlink constraints necessitate robust methods for identifying regions of interest in real time. This work presents an adaptive outlier detection algorithm based on the reconstruction error of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, designed explicitly for space mission applications. The algorithm adapts dynamically to evolving data distributions by using Incremental PCA, enabling deployment without a predefined model for all possible conditions. A pre-scaling process normalizes each feature's magnitude while preserving relative variance within feature types. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in detecting space plasma events, such as distinct space environments, dayside and nightside transients phenomena, and transition layers through NASA's MMS mission observations. Additionally, we apply the method to NASA's THEMIS data, successfully identifying a dayside transient using onboard-available measurements.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in determining treatment effects when a treatment has varied effects on different groups within a population. This is particularly troublesome in non-targeted trials where both sick and healthy subjects receive treatment. The proposed nonparametric approach, PCM (pre-cluster and merge), aims to efficiently estimate group effects in such scenarios. The researchers demonstrate the asymptotic consistency of PCM in a general setting and showcase its significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing methods through synthetic data experiments. The approach not only benefits treatment effect estimation but also extends to the consistent estimation of functions with a finite range. <div>

Abstract: A treatment may be appropriate for some group (the ``sick" group) on whom it has a positive effect, but it can also have a detrimental effect on subjects from another group (the ``healthy" group). In a non-targeted trial both sick and healthy subjects may be treated, producing heterogeneous effects within the treated group. Inferring the correct treatment effect on the sick population is then difficult, because the effects on the different groups get tangled. We propose an efficient nonparametric approach to estimating the group effects, called {\bf PCM} (pre-cluster and merge). We prove its asymptotic consistency in a general setting and show, on synthetic data, more than a 10x improvement in accuracy over existing state-of-the-art. Our approach applies more generally to consistent estimation of functions with a finite range.

Summary: <br />
Neural operators are efficient models for solving PDEs, but face challenges with attention mechanisms being computationally inefficient on large meshes and spectral convolutions degrading accuracy on irregular domains. To address this, a new attention mechanism in function spaces is proposed, called Subspace Parameterized Attention (SUPRA), which approximates attention within a finite-dimensional subspace. Laplacian eigenfunctions are used to construct a subspace on irregular domains for SUPRA. Experiments show that SUPRA reduces error rates by up to 33% on various PDE datasets while maintaining computational efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2504.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators are efficient surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their key components face challenges: (1) in order to improve accuracy, attention mechanisms suffer from computational inefficiency on large-scale meshes, and (2) spectral convolutions rely on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on regular grids and assume a flat geometry, which causes accuracy degradation on irregular domains. To tackle these problems, we regard the matrix-vector operations in the standard attention mechanism on vectors in Euclidean space as bilinear forms and linear operators in vector spaces and generalize the attention mechanism to function spaces. This new attention mechanism is fully equivalent to the standard attention but impossible to compute due to the infinite dimensionality of function spaces. To address this, inspired by model reduction techniques, we propose a Subspace Parameterized Attention (SUPRA) neural operator, which approximates the attention mechanism within a finite-dimensional subspace. To construct a subspace on irregular domains for SUPRA, we propose using the Laplacian eigenfunctions, which naturally adapt to domains' geometry and guarantee the optimal approximation for smooth functions. Experiments show that the SUPRA neural operator reduces error rates by up to 33% on various PDE datasets while maintaining state-of-the-art computational efficiency.

The article introduces GraphEdge, an efficient edge computing (EC) architecture designed for graph-structured scenarios like traffic flow prediction and social relationship recommender systems. GraphEdge utilizes a graph neural network (GNN) approach but enhances efficiency by considering user data associations and minimizing server communication costs. It employs a hierarchical traversal graph cut algorithm (HiCut) to optimize the graph layout and a deep reinforcement learning-based graph offloading algorithm (DRLGO) for optimal task offloading strategies. This subgraph-based approach aims to minimize task processing time and energy consumption while offloading user tasks to the same edge server whenever possible. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, dynamic adaptation, and performance of GraphEdge, even in dynamic scenarios.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, edge computing (EC) is gradually playing an important role in providing cost-effective services. However, existing approaches struggle to perform well in graph-structured scenarios where user data is correlated, such as traffic flow prediction and social relationship recommender systems. In particular, graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches lead to expensive server communication cost. To address this problem, we propose GraphEdge, an efficient GNN-based EC architecture. It considers the EC system of GNN tasks, where there are associations between users and it needs to take into account the task data of its neighbors when processing the tasks of a user. Specifically, the architecture first perceives the user topology and represents their data associations as a graph layout at each time step. Then the graph layout is optimized by calling our proposed hierarchical traversal graph cut algorithm (HiCut), which cuts the graph layout into multiple weakly associated subgraphs based on the aggregation characteristics of GNN, and the communication cost between different subgraphs during GNN inference is minimized. Finally, based on the optimized graph layout, our proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based graph offloading algorithm (DRLGO) is executed to obtain the optimal offloading strategy for the tasks of users, the offloading strategy is subgraph-based, it tries to offload user tasks in a subgraph to the same edge server as possible while minimizing the task processing time and energy consumption of the EC system. Experimental results show the good effectiveness and dynamic adaptation of our proposed architecture and it also performs well even in dynamic scenarios.

Summary: 
ScaleGNN is a new framework for large-scale graphs that addresses challenges faced by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It tackles the issues of over-smoothing and scalability by incorporating adaptive feature fusion and redundant feature masking mechanisms. The framework constructs neighbor matrices for different orders and learns their relative importance through trainable weights, emphasizing informative high-order neighbors while minimizing unnecessary computational costs. The High-order redundant feature masking mechanism based on the Local Contribution Score prevents redundant information propagation. Additionally, the framework adaptively integrates low-order and high-order features based on task relevance, enabling effective capture of local and global structural information without excessive complexity. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that ScaleGNN outperforms existing GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across various graph-based tasks by effectively capturing relational information between nodes. These models rely on iterative message passing to propagate node features, enabling nodes to aggregate information from their neighbors. Recent research has significantly improved the message-passing mechanism, enhancing GNN scalability on large-scale graphs. However, GNNs still face two main challenges: over-smoothing, where excessive message passing results in indistinguishable node representations, especially in deep networks incorporating high-order neighbors; and scalability issues, as traditional architectures suffer from high model complexity and increased inference time due to redundant information aggregation. This paper proposes a novel framework for large-scale graphs named ScaleGNN that simultaneously addresses both challenges by adaptively fusing multi-level graph features. We first construct neighbor matrices for each order, learning their relative information through trainable weights through an adaptive high-order feature fusion module. This allows the model to selectively emphasize informative high-order neighbors while reducing unnecessary computational costs. Additionally, we introduce a High-order redundant feature masking mechanism based on a Local Contribution Score (LCS), which enables the model to retain only the most relevant neighbors at each order, preventing redundant information propagation. Furthermore, low-order enhanced feature aggregation adaptively integrates low-order and high-order features based on task relevance, ensuring effective capture of both local and global structural information without excessive complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

<div> fairness metrics, federated learning, distributive justice, client-level, UDJ-FL 
Summary: 
Client-level fairness metrics in federated learning aim to ensure fairness across all clients in a federation by either achieving similar final performance for all clients or performance relative to their contribution. Existing works propose fairness metrics based on social theories, but lack alignment with practitioners' fairness ethics. The UDJ-FL framework presented in this work offers flexibility in achieving multiple distributive justice-based fairness metrics by combining fair resource allocation techniques and aleatoric uncertainty-based client weighing. Empirical results demonstrate that UDJ-FL can achieve egalitarian, utilitarian, Rawls' difference principle, and desert-based fairness, surpassing other popular fair federated learning approaches. The importance of aleatoric uncertainty weighing in UDJ-FL construction is emphasized, along with theoretical guarantees for generalization bounds. The publicly available UDJ-FL code allows for implementation and further exploration of its capabilities. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Client-level fairness metrics for federated learning are used to ensure that all clients in a federation either: a) have similar final performance on their local data distributions (i.e., client parity), or b) obtain final performance on their local data distributions relative to their contribution to the federated learning process (i.e., contribution fairness). While a handful of works that propose either client-parity or contribution-based fairness metrics ground their definitions and decisions in social theories of equality -- such as distributive justice -- most works arbitrarily choose what notion of fairness to align with which makes it difficult for practitioners to choose which fairness metric aligns best with their fairness ethics. In this work, we propose UDJ-FL (Uncertainty-based Distributive Justice for Federated Learning), a flexible federated learning framework that can achieve multiple distributive justice-based client-level fairness metrics. Namely, by utilizing techniques inspired by fair resource allocation, in conjunction with performing aleatoric uncertainty-based client weighing, our UDJ-FL framework is able to achieve egalitarian, utilitarian, Rawls' difference principle, or desert-based client-level fairness. We empirically show the ability of UDJ-FL to achieve all four defined distributive justice-based client-level fairness metrics in addition to providing fairness equivalent to (or surpassing) other popular fair federated learning works. Further, we provide justification for why aleatoric uncertainty weighing is necessary to the construction of our UDJ-FL framework as well as derive theoretical guarantees for the generalization bounds of UDJ-FL. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/alycia-noel/UDJ-FL.

Summary:
StreamRL is a new framework designed for reinforcement learning in large language models. It focuses on the disaggregated architecture to overcome resource coupling issues seen in the colocated architecture. By breaking traditional stage boundaries and utilizing a skewness-aware approach, StreamRL addresses pipeline and skewness bottlenecks, leading to improved throughput and cost-effectiveness. Experiments demonstrate significant enhancements in performance compared to existing systems, showcasing the potential of the disaggregated architecture for RL in large-scale training.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the core post-training technique for large language models (LLMs). RL for LLMs involves two stages: generation and training. The LLM first generates samples online, which are then used to derive rewards for training. The conventional view holds that the colocated architecture, where the two stages share resources via temporal multiplexing, outperforms the disaggregated architecture, in which dedicated resources are assigned to each stage. However, in real-world deployments, we observe that the colocated architecture suffers from resource coupling, where the two stages are constrained to use the same resources. This coupling compromises the scalability and cost-efficiency of colocated RL in large-scale training. In contrast, the disaggregated architecture allows for flexible resource allocation, supports heterogeneous training setups, and facilitates cross-datacenter deployment.
  StreamRL is designed with disaggregation from first principles and fully unlocks its potential by addressing two types of performance bottlenecks in existing disaggregated RL frameworks: pipeline bubbles, caused by stage dependencies, and skewness bubbles, resulting from long-tail output length distributions. To address pipeline bubbles, StreamRL breaks the traditional stage boundary in synchronous RL algorithms through stream generation and achieves full overlapping in asynchronous RL. To address skewness bubbles, StreamRL employs an output-length ranker model to identify long-tail samples and reduces generation time via skewness-aware dispatching and scheduling. Experiments show that StreamRL improves throughput by up to 2.66x compared to existing state-of-the-art systems, and improves cost-effectiveness by up to 1.33x in a heterogeneous, cross-datacenter setting.

Summary: 
The study demonstrates that two-layer self-attention and one-layer self-attention followed by a softmax function can universally approximate continuous sequence-to-sequence functions on compact domains using linear transformations. Through a novel interpolation-based approach to understanding attention's internal workings, the authors show that self-attention can replicate a generalized version of ReLU to any level of precision, encompassing various universal approximators. Additionally, the research reveals that two-layer multi-head attention alone serves as a sequence-to-sequence universal approximator, contrasting previous reliance on feed-forward networks in Transformers for universal approximation. Furthermore, the extension of techniques demonstrates that attention-only layers, including softmax, can approximate diverse statistical models within context, offering valuable insights into the capabilities of attention mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: We prove that with linear transformations, both (i) two-layer self-attention and (ii) one-layer self-attention followed by a softmax function are universal approximators for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions on compact domains. Our main technique is a new interpolation-based method for analyzing attention's internal mechanism. This leads to our key insight: self-attention is able to approximate a generalized version of ReLU to arbitrary precision, and hence subsumes many known universal approximators. Building on these, we show that two-layer multi-head attention alone suffices as a sequence-to-sequence universal approximator. In contrast, prior works rely on feed-forward networks to establish universal approximation in Transformers. Furthermore, we extend our techniques to show that, (softmax-)attention-only layers are capable of approximating various statistical models in-context. We believe these techniques hold independent interest.

Summary: OPUS-VFL is a novel framework for Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) that addresses critical limitations faced by existing systems. It introduces a privacy-aware incentive mechanism that rewards clients based on model contribution, privacy preservation, and resource investment. OPUS-VFL utilizes a leave-one-out strategy to quantify feature importance per client and integrates adaptive differential privacy to optimize noise levels for individual utility.

OPUS-VFL reduces label inference attack success rates, increases feature inference reconstruction error, and offers higher incentives for clients that contribute meaningfully while respecting privacy and cost constraints. This innovative solution provides a secure, fair, and performance-driven approach for real-world VFL implementations. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables organizations with disjoint feature spaces but shared user bases to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. However, existing VFL systems face critical limitations: they often lack effective incentive mechanisms, struggle to balance privacy-utility tradeoffs, and fail to accommodate clients with heterogeneous resource capabilities. These challenges hinder meaningful participation, degrade model performance, and limit practical deployment. To address these issues, we propose OPUS-VFL, an Optimal Privacy-Utility tradeoff Strategy for VFL. OPUS-VFL introduces a novel, privacy-aware incentive mechanism that rewards clients based on a principled combination of model contribution, privacy preservation, and resource investment. It employs a lightweight leave-one-out (LOO) strategy to quantify feature importance per client, and integrates an adaptive differential privacy mechanism that enables clients to dynamically calibrate noise levels to optimize their individual utility. Our framework is designed to be scalable, budget-balanced, and robust to inference and poisoning attacks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) demonstrate that OPUS-VFL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VFL baselines in both efficiency and robustness. It reduces label inference attack success rates by up to 20%, increases feature inference reconstruction error (MSE) by over 30%, and achieves up to 25% higher incentives for clients that contribute meaningfully while respecting privacy and cost constraints. These results highlight the practicality and innovation of OPUS-VFL as a secure, fair, and performance-driven solution for real-world VFL.

Abstract: We introduce AlphaGrad, a memory-efficient, conditionally stateless optimizer addressing the memory overhead and hyperparameter complexity of adaptive methods like Adam. AlphaGrad enforces scale invariance via tensor-wise L2 gradient normalization followed by a smooth hyperbolic tangent transformation, $g' = \tanh(\alpha \cdot \tilde{g})$, controlled by a single steepness parameter $\alpha$. Our contributions include: (1) the AlphaGrad algorithm formulation; (2) a formal non-convex convergence analysis guaranteeing stationarity; (3) extensive empirical evaluation on diverse RL benchmarks (DQN, TD3, PPO). Compared to Adam, AlphaGrad demonstrates a highly context-dependent performance profile. While exhibiting instability in off-policy DQN, it provides enhanced training stability with competitive results in TD3 (requiring careful $\alpha$ tuning) and achieves substantially superior performance in on-policy PPO. These results underscore the critical importance of empirical $\alpha$ selection, revealing strong interactions between the optimizer's dynamics and the underlying RL algorithm. AlphaGrad presents a compelling alternative optimizer for memory-constrained scenarios and shows significant promise for on-policy learning regimes where its stability and efficiency advantages can be particularly impactful.

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework for IoT systems. The framework aims to address scalability, security, and real-time decision-making challenges in large-scale IoT deployments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT ecosystems introduces severe challenges in scalability, security, and real-time decision-making. Traditional centralized architectures struggle with latency, privacy concerns, and excessive resource consumption, making them unsuitable for modern large-scale IoT deployments. This paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative IoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS), dynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By leveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances intelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments. Evaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model accuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency, outperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt). These findings highlight the potential of integrating LLM-powered federated learning into large-scale IoT ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, scalable, and adaptive IoT management solutions.

<div> optimizer, grokking phenomenon, Muon, AdamW, Transformer architecture

Summary: 
This paper explores the impact of different optimizers on the grokking phenomenon, where models show delayed generalization. Experiments were conducted on seven numerical tasks using a modern Transformer architecture. The study varied the optimizer (Muon vs. AdamW) and softmax activation function to analyze their combined influence on learning dynamics. Results indicate that the Muon optimizer, incorporating spectral norm constraints and second-order information, significantly speeds up the onset of grokking compared to AdamW. The mean grokking epoch decreased from 153.09 to 102.89 with Muon across all settings, a statistically significant difference. This implies that the choice of optimizer plays a vital role in transitioning from memorization to generalization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of different optimizers on the grokking phenomenon, where models exhibit delayed generalization. We conducted experiments across seven numerical tasks (primarily modular arithmetic) using a modern Transformer architecture. The experimental configuration systematically varied the optimizer (Muon vs. AdamW) and the softmax activation function (standard softmax, stablemax, and sparsemax) to assess their combined effect on learning dynamics. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the Muon optimizer, characterized by its use of spectral norm constraints and second-order information, significantly accelerates the onset of grokking compared to the widely used AdamW optimizer. Specifically, Muon reduced the mean grokking epoch from 153.09 to 102.89 across all configurations, a statistically significant difference (t = 5.0175, p = 6.33e-08). This suggests that the optimizer choice plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition from memorization to generalization.

<div> Keywords: robots, vision-language-action models, generalization, co-training, robotic manipulation 

Summary: 
The article introduces a new model, $\pi_{0.5}$, based on $\pi_{0}$, aimed at enhancing the generalization capabilities of vision-language-action models for real-world robotic tasks. The model employs co-training on diverse tasks, utilizing data from multiple sources like different robots, semantic predictions, and web data. By combining image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask predictions, and low-level actions, $\pi_{0.5}$ enables effective generalization for robotic manipulation tasks. Experiments demonstrate the necessity of knowledge transfer for successful generalization, showcasing the system's ability to perform complex and long-horizon manipulation tasks, such as cleaning kitchens and bedrooms, in new environments. This breakthrough illustrates the potential of end-to-end learning-enabled robotic systems for practical applications outside controlled lab settings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In order for robots to be useful, they must perform practically relevant tasks in the real world, outside of the lab. While vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive results for end-to-end robot control, it remains an open question how far such models can generalize in the wild. We describe $\pi_{0.5}$, a new model based on $\pi_{0}$ that uses co-training on heterogeneous tasks to enable broad generalization. $\pi_{0.5}$\ uses data from multiple robots, high-level semantic prediction, web data, and other sources to enable broadly generalizable real-world robotic manipulation. Our system uses a combination of co-training and hybrid multi-modal examples that combine image observations, language commands, object detections, semantic subtask prediction, and low-level actions. Our experiments show that this kind of knowledge transfer is essential for effective generalization, and we demonstrate for the first time that an end-to-end learning-enabled robotic system can perform long-horizon and dexterous manipulation skills, such as cleaning a kitchen or bedroom, in entirely new homes.

<title>LLMs are Greedy Agents: Effects of RL Fine-tuning on Decision-Making Abilities</title>

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in various agentic applications. A key hypothesis is that LLMs, leveraging common sense and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, can effectively explore and efficiently solve complex domains. However, LLM agents have been found to suffer from sub-optimal exploration and the knowing-doing gap, the inability to effectively act on knowledge present in the model. In this work, we systematically study why LLMs perform sub-optimally in decision-making scenarios. In particular, we closely examine three prevalent failure modes: greediness, frequency bias, and the knowing-doing gap. We propose mitigation of these shortcomings by fine-tuning via Reinforcement Learning (RL) on self-generated CoT rationales. Our experiments across multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Tic-tac-toe, demonstrate that RL fine-tuning enhances the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap. Finally, we study both classic exploration mechanisms, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, and LLM-specific approaches, such as self-correction and self-consistency, to enable more effective fine-tuning of LLMs for decision-making.

Abstract: Code editing is a foundational task in software development, where its effectiveness depends on whether it introduces desired code property changes without changing the original code's intended functionality. Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.

Abstract: Multi-agents has exhibited significant intelligence in real-word simulations with Large language models (LLMs) due to the capabilities of social cognition and knowledge retrieval. However, existing research on agents equipped with effective cognition chains including reasoning, planning, decision-making and reflecting remains limited, especially in the dynamically interactive scenarios. In addition, unlike human, prompt-based responses face challenges in psychological state perception and empirical calibration during uncertain gaming process, which can inevitably lead to cognition bias. In light of above, we introduce PolicyEvol-Agent, a comprehensive LLM-empowered framework characterized by systematically acquiring intentions of others and adaptively optimizing irrational strategies for continual enhancement. Specifically, PolicyEvol-Agent first obtains reflective expertise patterns and then integrates a range of cognitive operations with Theory of Mind alongside internal and external perspectives. Simulation results, outperforming RL-based models and agent-based methods, demonstrate the superiority of PolicyEvol-Agent for final gaming victory. Moreover, the policy evolution mechanism reveals the effectiveness of dynamic guideline adjustments in both automatic and human evaluation.

Abstract: Exosomes are small vesicles crucial for cell signaling and disease biomarkers. Due to their complexity, an "omics" approach is preferable to individual biomarkers. While Raman spectroscopy is effective for exosome analysis, it requires high sample concentrations and has limited sensitivity to lipids and proteins. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy helps overcome these challenges. In this study, we leverage Neo4j graph databases to organize 3,045 Raman spectra of exosomes, enhancing data generalization. To further refine spectral analysis, we introduce a novel spectral filtering process that integrates the PageRank Filter with optimal Dimensionality Reduction. This method improves feature selection, resulting in superior classification performance. Specifically, the Extra Trees model, using our spectral processing approach, achieves 0.76 and 0.857 accuracy in classifying hyperglycemic, hypoglycemic, and normal exosome samples based on Raman spectra and surface, respectively, with group 10-fold cross-validation. Our results show that graph-based spectral filtering combined with optimal dimensionality reduction significantly improves classification accuracy by reducing noise while preserving key biomarker signals. This novel framework enhances Raman-based exosome analysis, expanding its potential for biomedical applications, disease diagnostics, and biomarker discovery.

Abstract: Endovascular procedures have revolutionized the treatment of vascular diseases thanks to minimally invasive solutions that significantly reduce patient recovery time and enhance clinical outcomes. However, the precision and dexterity required during these procedures poses considerable challenges for interventionists. Robotic systems have emerged offering transformative solutions, addressing issues such as operator fatigue, radiation exposure, and the inherent limitations of human precision. The integration of Embodied Intelligence (EI) into these systems signifies a paradigm shift, enabling robots to navigate complex vascular networks and adapt to dynamic physiological conditions. Data-driven approaches, advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and machine learning techniques, are at the forefront of this evolution. These methods augment procedural intelligence by facilitating real-time vessel segmentation, device tracking, and anatomical landmark detection. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning further refine navigation strategies and replicate experts' techniques. This review systematically examines the integration of EI principles into robotic technologies, in relation to endovascular procedures. We discuss recent advancements in intelligent perception and data-driven control, and their practical applications in robot-assisted endovascular procedures. By critically evaluating current limitations and emerging opportunities, this review establishes a framework for future developments, emphasizing the potential for greater autonomy and improved clinical outcomes. Emerging trends and specific areas of research, such as federated learning for medical data sharing, explainable AI for clinical decision support, and advanced human-robot collaboration paradigms, are also explored, offering insights into the future direction of this rapidly evolving field.

<title>LongPerceptualThoughts: Distilling System-2 Reasoning for System-1 Perception</title>

Abstract: Recent reasoning models through test-time scaling have demonstrated that long chain-of-thoughts can unlock substantial performance boosts in hard reasoning tasks such as math and code. However, the benefit of such long thoughts for system-2 reasoning is relatively less explored in other domains such as perceptual tasks where shallower, system-1 reasoning seems sufficient. In this paper, we introduce LongPerceptualThoughts, a new synthetic dataset with 30K long-thought traces for perceptual tasks. The key challenges in synthesizing elaborate reasoning thoughts for perceptual tasks are that off-the-shelf models are not yet equipped with such thinking behavior and that it is not straightforward to build a reliable process verifier for perceptual tasks. Thus, we propose a novel three-stage data synthesis framework that first synthesizes verifiable multiple-choice questions from dense image descriptions, then extracts simple CoTs from VLMs for those verifiable problems, and finally expands those simple thoughts to elaborate long thoughts via frontier reasoning models. In controlled experiments with a strong instruction-tuned 7B model, we demonstrate notable improvements over existing visual reasoning data-generation methods. Our model, trained on the generated dataset, achieves an average +3.4 points improvement over 5 vision-centric benchmarks, including +11.8 points on V$^*$ Bench. Notably, despite being tuned for vision tasks, it also improves performance on the text reasoning benchmark, MMLU-Pro, by +2 points.

Abstract: Identifying minimum-energy paths (MEPs) is crucial for understanding chemical reaction mechanisms but remains computationally demanding. We introduce MEPIN, a scalable machine-learning method for efficiently predicting MEPs from reactant and product configurations, without relying on transition-state geometries or pre-optimized reaction paths during training. The task is defined as predicting deviations from geometric interpolations along reaction coordinates. We address this task with a continuous reaction path model based on a symmetry-broken equivariant neural network that generates a flexible number of intermediate structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective, with efficiency enhanced by incorporating geometric priors from geodesic interpolation as initial interpolations or pre-training objectives. Our approach generalizes across diverse chemical reactions and achieves accurate alignment with reference intrinsic reaction coordinates, as demonstrated on various small molecule reactions and [3+2] cycloadditions. Our method enables the exploration of large chemical reaction spaces with efficient, data-driven predictions of reaction pathways.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has expanded the attack surface, necessitating efficient intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for network protection. This paper presents FLARE, a feature-based lightweight aggregation for robust evaluation of IoT intrusion detection to address the challenges of securing IoT environments through feature aggregation techniques. FLARE utilizes a multilayered processing approach, incorporating session, flow, and time-based sliding-window data aggregation to analyze network behavior and capture vital features from IoT network traffic data. We perform extensive evaluations on IoT data generated from our laboratory experimental setup to assess the effectiveness of the proposed aggregation technique. To classify attacks in IoT IDS, we employ four supervised learning models and two deep learning models. We validate the performance of these models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our results reveal that incorporating the FLARE aggregation technique as a foundational step in feature engineering, helps lay a structured representation, and enhances the performance of complex end-to-end models, making it a crucial step in IoT IDS pipeline. Our findings highlight the potential of FLARE as a valuable technique to improve performance and reduce computational costs of end-to-end IDS implementations, thereby fostering more robust IoT intrusion detection systems.

Abstract: We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.

Abstract: Surrogate markers are most commonly studied within the context of randomized clinical trials. However, the need for alternative outcomes extends beyond these settings and may be more pronounced in real-world public health and social science research, where randomized trials are often impractical. Research on identifying surrogates in real-world non-randomized data is scarce, as available statistical approaches for evaluating surrogate markers tend to rely on the assumption that treatment is randomized. While the few methods that allow for non-randomized treatment/exposure appropriately handle confounding individual characteristics, they do not offer a way to examine surrogate heterogeneity with respect to patient characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess surrogate heterogeneity in real-world, i.e., non-randomized, data and implement this framework using various meta-learners. Our approach allows us to quantify heterogeneity in surrogate strength with respect to patient characteristics while accommodating confounders through the use of flexible, off-the-shelf machine learning methods. In addition, we use our framework to identify individuals for whom the surrogate is a valid replacement of the primary outcome. We examine the performance of our methods via a simulation study and application to examine heterogeneity in the surrogacy of hemoglobin A1c as a surrogate for fasting plasma glucose.

Abstract: In the context of multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates, we propose Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs), which can be applied in conjunction with any existing imputation technique. In addition to a neural network trained on the imputed data, PENNs pass the vectors of observation indicators through a second neural network to provide a compact representation. The outputs are then combined in a third neural network to produce final predictions. Our main theoretical result exploits an assumption that the observation patterns can be partitioned into cells on which the Bayes regression function behaves similarly, and belongs to a compositional H\"older class. It provides a finite-sample excess risk bound that holds for an arbitrary missingness mechanism, and in combination with a complementary minimax lower bound, demonstrates that our PENN estimator attains in typical cases the minimax rate of convergence as if the cells of the partition were known in advance, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the sample size. Numerical experiments on simulated, semi-synthetic and real data confirm that the PENN estimator consistently improves, often dramatically, on standard neural networks without pattern embedding. Code to reproduce our experiments, as well as a tutorial on how to apply our method, is publicly available.

Abstract: Learning-based approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have become widely used for developing control policies for autonomous agents, such as locomotion policies for legged robots. RL training typically maximizes a predefined reward (or minimizes a corresponding cost/loss) by iteratively optimizing policies within a simulator. Starting from a randomly initialized policy, the empirical expected reward follows a trajectory with an overall increasing trend. While some policies become temporarily stuck in local optima, a well-defined training process generally converges to a reward level with noisy oscillations. However, selecting a policy for real-world deployment is rarely an analytical decision (i.e., simply choosing the one with the highest reward) and is instead often performed through trial and error. To improve sim-to-real transfer, most research focuses on the pre-convergence stage, employing techniques such as domain randomization, multi-fidelity training, adversarial training, and architectural innovations. However, these methods do not eliminate the inevitable convergence trajectory and noisy oscillations of rewards, leading to heuristic policy selection or cherry-picking. This paper addresses the post-convergence sim-to-real transfer problem by introducing a worst-case performance transference optimization approach, formulated as a convex quadratic-constrained linear programming problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in transferring RL-based locomotion policies from simulation to real-world laboratory tests.

<title>Solving Multi-Agent Safe Optimal Control with Distributed Epigraph Form MARL</title>

Abstract: Tasks for multi-robot systems often require the robots to collaborate and complete a team goal while maintaining safety. This problem is usually formalized as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which targets minimizing a global cost and bringing the mean of constraint violation below a user-defined threshold. Inspired by real-world robotic applications, we define safety as zero constraint violation. While many safe multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to solve CMDPs, these algorithms suffer from unstable training in this setting. To tackle this, we use the epigraph form for constrained optimization to improve training stability and prove that the centralized epigraph form problem can be solved in a distributed fashion by each agent. This results in a novel centralized training distributed execution MARL algorithm named Def-MARL. Simulation experiments on 8 different tasks across 2 different simulators show that Def-MARL achieves the best overall performance, satisfies safety constraints, and maintains stable training. Real-world hardware experiments on Crazyflie quadcopters demonstrate the ability of Def-MARL to safely coordinate agents to complete complex collaborative tasks compared to other methods.

Abstract: The surging demand for GPUs in datacenters for machine learning (ML) has made efficient GPU utilization crucial. However, meeting the diverse needs of ML models while optimizing resource usage is challenging. To enable transparent, fine-grained GPU management that maximizes utilization and energy efficiency while maintaining strong isolation, an operating system (OS) approach is needed. This paper introduces LithOS, a first step toward a GPU OS. LithOS includes the following new abstractions and mechanisms for efficient GPU resource management: (i) a novel TPC Scheduler that supports spatial scheduling at the granularity of individual TPCs, unlocking efficient TPC stealing between workloads; (ii) transparent kernel atomization to reduce head-of-line blocking and enable dynamic resource reallocation mid-execution; (iii) a lightweight hardware right-sizing mechanism that determines the minimal TPC resources needed per atom; and (iv) a transparent power management mechanism that reduces power consumption based on in-flight work behavior. We implement LithOS in Rust and evaluate its performance across extensive ML environments, comparing it to state-of-the-art solutions from NVIDIA and prior research. For inference stacking, LithOS reduces tail latencies by 13x compared to MPS; compared to the best SotA, it reduces tail latencies by 3x while improving aggregate throughput by 1.6x. In hybrid inference-training stacking, LithOS reduces tail latencies by 4.7x compared to MPS; compared to the best SotA, it reduces tail latencies 1.18x while improving aggregate throughput by 1.35x. Finally, for a modest performance hit under 4%, LithOS's right-sizing provides a quarter of GPU capacity savings on average, while for a 7% hit, its power management yields a quarter of a GPU's energy savings. Overall, LithOS increases GPU efficiency, establishing a foundation for future OS research on GPUs.

Abstract: We introduce Large Language Model-Assisted Preference Prediction (LAPP), a novel framework for robot learning that enables efficient, customizable, and expressive behavior acquisition with minimum human effort. Unlike prior approaches that rely heavily on reward engineering, human demonstrations, motion capture, or expensive pairwise preference labels, LAPP leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate preference labels from raw state-action trajectories collected during reinforcement learning (RL). These labels are used to train an online preference predictor, which in turn guides the policy optimization process toward satisfying high-level behavioral specifications provided by humans. Our key technical contribution is the integration of LLMs into the RL feedback loop through trajectory-level preference prediction, enabling robots to acquire complex skills including subtle control over gait patterns and rhythmic timing. We evaluate LAPP on a diverse set of quadruped locomotion and dexterous manipulation tasks and show that it achieves efficient learning, higher final performance, faster adaptation, and precise control of high-level behaviors. Notably, LAPP enables robots to master highly dynamic and expressive tasks such as quadruped backflips, which remain out of reach for standard LLM-generated or handcrafted rewards. Our results highlight LAPP as a promising direction for scalable preference-driven robot learning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the go-to method for text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from noise through a process called reverse diffusion. Understanding the dynamics of the reverse diffusion process is crucial in steering the generation and achieving high sample quality. However, the inner workings of diffusion models is still largely a mystery due to their black-box nature and complex, multi-step generation process. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), aim at uncovering the operating principles of models through granular analysis of their internal representations. These MI techniques have been successful in understanding and steering the behavior of large language models at scale. However, the great potential of SAEs has not yet been applied toward gaining insight into the intricate generative process of diffusion models. In this work, we leverage the SAE framework to probe the inner workings of a popular text-to-image diffusion model, and uncover a variety of human-interpretable concepts in its activations. Interestingly, we find that even before the first reverse diffusion step is completed, the final composition of the scene can be predicted surprisingly well by looking at the spatial distribution of activated concepts. Moreover, going beyond correlational analysis, we show that the discovered concepts have a causal effect on the model output and can be leveraged to steer the generative process. We design intervention techniques aimed at manipulating image composition and style, and demonstrate that (1) in early stages of diffusion image composition can be effectively controlled, (2) in the middle stages of diffusion image composition is finalized, however stylistic interventions are effective, and (3) in the final stages of diffusion only minor textural details are subject to change.

<title>T2VShield: Model-Agnostic Jailbreak Defense for Text-to-Video Models</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence has made text to video models essential for building future multimodal world simulators. However, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where specially crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful or unsafe content. Such vulnerabilities undermine the reliability and security of simulation based applications. In this paper, we propose T2VShield, a comprehensive and model agnostic defense framework designed to protect text to video models from jailbreak threats. Our method systematically analyzes the input, model, and output stages to identify the limitations of existing defenses, including semantic ambiguities in prompts, difficulties in detecting malicious content in dynamic video outputs, and inflexible model centric mitigation strategies. T2VShield introduces a prompt rewriting mechanism based on reasoning and multimodal retrieval to sanitize malicious inputs, along with a multi scope detection module that captures local and global inconsistencies across time and modalities. The framework does not require access to internal model parameters and works with both open and closed source systems. Extensive experiments on five platforms show that T2VShield can reduce jailbreak success rates by up to 35 percent compared to strong baselines. We further develop a human centered audiovisual evaluation protocol to assess perceptual safety, emphasizing the importance of visual level defense in enhancing the trustworthiness of next generation multimodal simulators.

Abstract: Recently, Transformer-based robotic manipulation methods utilize multi-view spatial representations and language instructions to learn robot motion trajectories by leveraging numerous robot demonstrations. However, the collection of robot data is extremely challenging, and existing methods lack the capability for continuous learning on new tasks with only a few demonstrations. In this paper, we formulate these challenges as the Few-Shot Action-Incremental Learning (FSAIL) task, and accordingly design a Task-prOmpt graPh evolutIon poliCy (TOPIC) to address these issues. Specifically, to address the data scarcity issue in robotic imitation learning, TOPIC learns Task-Specific Prompts (TSP) through the deep interaction of multi-modal information within few-shot demonstrations, thereby effectively extracting the task-specific discriminative information. On the other hand, to enhance the capability for continual learning on new tasks and mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting, TOPIC adopts a Continuous Evolution Strategy (CES). CES leverages the intrinsic relationships between tasks to construct a task relation graph, which effectively facilitates the adaptation of new tasks by reusing skills learned from previous tasks. TOPIC pioneers few-shot continual learning in the robotic manipulation task, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that TOPIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 26$\%$ in success rate, significantly enhancing the continual learning capabilities of existing Transformer-based policies.

<title>RiskNet: Interaction-Aware Risk Forecasting for Autonomous Driving in Long-Tail Scenarios</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15541</link>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in long-tail scenarios remains a critical challenge, particularly under high uncertainty and complex multi-agent interactions. To address this, we propose RiskNet, an interaction-aware risk forecasting framework, which integrates deterministic risk modeling with probabilistic behavior prediction for comprehensive risk assessment. At its core, RiskNet employs a field-theoretic model that captures interactions among ego vehicle, surrounding agents, and infrastructure via interaction fields and force. This model supports multidimensional risk evaluation across diverse scenarios (highways, intersections, and roundabouts), and shows robustness under high-risk and long-tail settings. To capture the behavioral uncertainty, we incorporate a graph neural network (GNN)-based trajectory prediction module, which learns multi-modal future motion distributions. Coupled with the deterministic risk field, it enables dynamic, probabilistic risk inference across time, enabling proactive safety assessment under uncertainty. Evaluations on the highD, inD, and rounD datasets, spanning lane changes, turns, and complex merges, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional approaches (e.g., TTC, THW, RSS, NC Field) in terms of accuracy, responsiveness, and directional sensitivity, while maintaining strong generalization across scenarios. This framework supports real-time, scenario-adaptive risk forecasting and demonstrates strong generalization across uncertain driving environments. It offers a unified foundation for safety-critical decision-making in long-tail scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based in-application assistants, or copilots, can automate software tasks, but users often prefer learning by doing, raising questions about the optimal level of automation for an effective user experience. We investigated two automation paradigms by designing and implementing a fully automated copilot (AutoCopilot) and a semi-automated copilot (GuidedCopilot) that automates trivial steps while offering step-by-step visual guidance. In a user study (N=20) across data analysis and visual design tasks, GuidedCopilot outperformed AutoCopilot in user control, software utility, and learnability, especially for exploratory and creative tasks, while AutoCopilot saved time for simpler visual tasks. A follow-up design exploration (N=10) enhanced GuidedCopilot with task-and state-aware features, including in-context preview clips and adaptive instructions. Our findings highlight the critical role of user control and tailored guidance in designing the next generation of copilots that enhance productivity, support diverse skill levels, and foster deeper software engagement.

<title>SPECI: Skill Prompts based Hierarchical Continual Imitation Learning for Robot Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Real-world robot manipulation in dynamic unstructured environments requires lifelong adaptability to evolving objects, scenes and tasks. Traditional imitation learning relies on static training paradigms, which are ill-suited for lifelong adaptation. Although Continual Imitation Learnin (CIL) enables incremental task adaptation while preserving learned knowledge, current CIL methods primarily overlook the intrinsic skill characteristics of robot manipulation or depend on manually defined and rigid skills, leading to suboptimal cross-task knowledge transfer. To address these issues, we propose Skill Prompts-based HiErarchical Continual Imitation Learning (SPECI), a novel end-to-end hierarchical CIL policy architecture for robot manipulation. The SPECI framework consists of a multimodal perception and fusion module for heterogeneous sensory information encoding, a high-level skill inference module for dynamic skill extraction and selection, and a low-level action execution module for precise action generation. To enable efficient knowledge transfer on both skill and task levels, SPECI performs continual implicit skill acquisition and reuse via an expandable skill codebook and an attention-driven skill selection mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce mode approximation to augment the last two modules with task-specific and task-sharing parameters, thereby enhancing task-level knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on diverse manipulation task suites demonstrate that SPECI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods across all evaluated metrics, revealing exceptional bidirectional knowledge transfer and superior overall performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in code generation tasks. However, most existing benchmarks focus on isolated functions and fail to capture the complexity of real-world, class-level software structures. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale, Python class-level dataset curated from $13{,}174$ real-world open-source projects. The dataset contains over 842,000 class skeletons, each including class and method signatures, along with associated docstrings when available. We preserve structural and contextual dependencies critical to realistic software development scenarios and enrich the dataset with static code metrics to support downstream analysis. To evaluate the usefulness of this dataset, we use extracted class skeletons as prompts for GPT-4 to generate full class implementations. Results show that the LLM-generated classes exhibit strong lexical and structural similarity to human-written counterparts, with average ROUGE@L, BLEU, and TSED scores of 0.80, 0.59, and 0.73, respectively. These findings confirm that well-structured prompts derived from real-world class skeletons significantly enhance LLM performance in class-level code generation. This dataset offers a valuable resource for benchmarking, training, and improving LLMs in realistic software engineering contexts.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of energy efficiency management faced by intelligent IoT devices in complex application environments. A novel optimization method is proposed, combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) with an edge collaboration mechanism. The method builds a state-action-reward interaction model and introduces edge nodes as intermediaries for state aggregation and policy scheduling. This enables dynamic resource coordination and task allocation among multiple devices. During the modeling process, device status, task load, and network resources are jointly incorporated into the state space. The DQN is used to approximate and learn the optimal scheduling strategy. To enhance the model's ability to perceive inter-device relationships, a collaborative graph structure is introduced to model the multi-device environment and assist in decision optimization. Experiments are conducted using real-world IoT data collected from the FastBee platform. Several comparative and validation tests are performed, including energy efficiency comparisons across different scheduling strategies, robustness analysis under varying task loads, and evaluation of state dimension impacts on policy convergence speed. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing baseline approaches in terms of average energy consumption, processing latency, and resource utilization. This confirms its effectiveness and practicality in intelligent IoT scenarios.

Abstract: Accurately identifying the parameters of electrochemical models of li-ion battery (LiB) cells is a critical task for enhancing the fidelity and predictive ability. Traditional parameter identification methods often require extensive data collection experiments and lack adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper describes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach that dynamically tailors the current profile applied to a LiB cell to optimize the parameters identifiability of the electrochemical model. The proposed framework is implemented in real-time using a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup, which serves as a reliable testbed for evaluating the RL-based design strategy. The HIL validation confirms that the RL-based experimental design outperforms conventional test protocols used for parameter identification in terms of both reducing the modeling errors on a verification test and minimizing the duration of the experiment used for parameter identification.

<title>On the Price of Differential Privacy for Hierarchical Clustering</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental unsupervised machine learning task with the aim of organizing data into a hierarchy of clusters. Many applications of hierarchical clustering involve sensitive user information, therefore motivating recent studies on differentially private hierarchical clustering under the rigorous framework of Dasgupta's objective. However, it has been shown that any privacy-preserving algorithm under edge-level differential privacy necessarily suffers a large error. To capture practical applications of this problem, we focus on the weight privacy model, where each edge of the input graph is at least unit weight. We present a novel algorithm in the weight privacy model that shows significantly better approximation than known impossibility results in the edge-level DP setting. In particular, our algorithm achieves $O(\log^{1.5}n/\varepsilon)$ multiplicative error for $\varepsilon$-DP and runs in polynomial time, where $n$ is the size of the input graph, and the cost is never worse than the optimal additive error in existing work. We complement our algorithm by showing if the unit-weight constraint does not apply, the lower bound for weight-level DP hierarchical clustering is essentially the same as the edge-level DP, i.e. $\Omega(n^2/\varepsilon)$ additive error. As a result, we also obtain a new lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}(1/\varepsilon)$ additive error for balanced sparsest cuts in the weight-level DP model, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results show that our algorithm performs well in terms of extra cost and has good scalability to large graphs.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.

Abstract: Food drying is essential for food production, extending shelf life, and reducing transportation costs. Accurate real-time forecasting of drying readiness is crucial for minimizing energy consumption, improving productivity, and ensuring product quality. However, this remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of drying, limited data availability, and the lack of effective predictive analytical methods. To address this gap, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal data fusion framework that integrates in-situ video data with process parameters for real-time food drying readiness forecasting. Our approach leverages a new encoder-decoder architecture with modality-specific encoders and a transformer-based decoder to effectively extract features while preserving the unique structure of each modality. We apply our approach to sugar cookie drying, where time-to-ready is predicted at each timestamp. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an average prediction error of only 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art data fusion methods by 65.69% and a video-only model by 11.30%. Additionally, our model balances prediction accuracy, model size, and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for heterogenous industrial datasets. The proposed model is extensible to various other industrial modality fusion tasks for online decision-making.

Abstract: Various Deep Learning (DL) methods have recently been utilized to detect software vulnerabilities. Real-world software vulnerability datasets are rare and hard to acquire as there's no simple metric for classifying vulnerability. Such datasets are heavily imbalanced, and none of the current datasets are considered huge for DL models. To tackle these problems a recent work has tried to augment the dataset using the source code and generate realistic single-statement vulnerabilities which is not quite practical and requires manual checking of the generated vulnerabilities. In this regard, we aim to explore the augmentation of vulnerabilities at the representation level to help current models learn better which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We implement and evaluate the 5 augmentation techniques that augment the embedding of the data and recently have been used for code search which is a completely different software engineering task. We also introduced a conditioned version of those augmentation methods, which ensures the augmentation does not change the vulnerable section of the vector representation. We show that such augmentation methods can be helpful and increase the f1-score by up to 9.67%, yet they cannot beat Random Oversampling when balancing datasets which increases the f1-score by 10.82%!

Abstract: Data races are a prevalent class of concurrency bugs in shared-memory parallel programs, posing significant challenges to software reliability and reproducibility. While there is an extensive body of research on detecting data races and a wealth of practical detection tools across various programming languages, considerably less effort has been directed toward automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale. In large codebases, data races are continuously introduced and exhibit myriad patterns, making automated fixing particularly challenging.
  In this paper, we tackle the problem of automatically fixing data races at an industrial scale. We present Dr.Fix, a tool that combines large language models (LLMs) with program analysis to generate fixes for data races in real-world settings, effectively addressing a broad spectrum of racy patterns in complex code contexts. Implemented for Go--the programming language widely used in modern microservice architectures where concurrency is pervasive and data races are common--Dr.Fix seamlessly integrates into existing development workflows. We detail the design of Dr.Fix and examine how individual design choices influence the quality of the fixes produced. Over the past 18 months, Dr.Fix has been integrated into developer workflows at Uber demonstrating its practical utility. During this period, Dr.Fix produced patches for 224 (55%) from a corpus of 404 data races spanning various categories; 193 of these patches (86%) were accepted by more than a hundred developers via code reviews and integrated into the codebase.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel AI vision-enabled pediatric prosthetic hand designed to assist children aged 10-12 with upper limb disabilities. The prosthesis features an anthropomorphic appearance, multi-articulating functionality, and a lightweight design that mimics a natural hand, making it both accessible and affordable for low-income families. Using 3D printing technology and integrating advanced machine vision, sensing, and embedded computing, the prosthetic hand offers a low-cost, customizable solution that addresses the limitations of current myoelectric prostheses. A micro camera is interfaced with a low-power FPGA for real-time object detection and assists with precise grasping. The onboard DL-based object detection and grasp classification models achieved accuracies of 96% and 100% respectively. In the force prediction, the mean absolute error was found to be 0.018. The features of the proposed prosthetic hand can thus be summarized as: a) a wrist-mounted micro camera for artificial sensing, enabling a wide range of hand-based tasks; b) real-time object detection and distance estimation for precise grasping; and c) ultra-low-power operation that delivers high performance within constrained power and resource limits.

Our neural bases can then be used to fit an input sketch of a flow, which will inherit the same fundamental properties from the bases. We then can animate such flow in real-time using standard time integrators. Our neural bases can accommodate different domains and naturally extend to three dimensions.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior. We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of over 125,000 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4% respectively. An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.

<title>TrojanDam: Detection-Free Backdoor Defense in Federated Learning through Proactive Model Robustification utilizing OOD Data</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) systems allow decentralized data-owning clients to jointly train a global model through uploading their locally trained updates to a centralized server. The property of decentralization enables adversaries to craft carefully designed backdoor updates to make the global model misclassify only when encountering adversary-chosen triggers. Existing defense mechanisms mainly rely on post-training detection after receiving updates. These methods either fail to identify updates which are deliberately fabricated statistically close to benign ones, or show inconsistent performance in different FL training stages. The effect of unfiltered backdoor updates will accumulate in the global model, and eventually become functional. Given the difficulty of ruling out every backdoor update, we propose a backdoor defense paradigm, which focuses on proactive robustification on the global model against potential backdoor attacks. We first reveal that the successful launching of backdoor attacks in FL stems from the lack of conflict between malicious and benign updates on redundant neurons of ML models. We proceed to prove the feasibility of activating redundant neurons utilizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in centralized settings, and migrating to FL settings to propose a novel backdoor defense mechanism, TrojanDam. The proposed mechanism has the FL server continuously inject fresh OOD mappings into the global model to activate redundant neurons, canceling the effect of backdoor updates during aggregation. We conduct systematic and extensive experiments to illustrate the superior performance of TrojanDam, over several SOTA backdoor defense methods across a wide range of FL settings.

<title>Policy-Based Radiative Transfer: Solving the $2$-Level Atom Non-LTE Problem using Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: We present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for solving the classical 2-level atom non-LTE radiative transfer problem by framing it as a control task in which an RL agent learns a depth-dependent source function $S(\tau)$ that self-consistently satisfies the equation of statistical equilibrium (SE). The agent's policy is optimized entirely via reward-based interactions with a radiative transfer engine, without explicit knowledge of the ground truth. This method bypasses the need for constructing approximate lambda operators ($\Lambda^*$) common in accelerated iterative schemes. Additionally, it requires no extensive precomputed labeled datasets to extract a supervisory signal, and avoids backpropagating gradients through the complex RT solver itself. Finally, we show through experiment that a simple feedforward neural network trained greedily cannot solve for SE, possibly due to the moving target nature of the problem. Our $\Lambda^*-\text{Free}$ method offers potential advantages for complex scenarios (e.g., atmospheres with enhanced velocity fields, multi-dimensional geometries, or complex microphysics) where $\Lambda^*$ construction or solver differentiability is challenging. Additionally, the agent can be incentivized to find more efficient policies by manipulating the discount factor, leading to a reprioritization of immediate rewards. If demonstrated to generalize past its training data, this RL framework could serve as an alternative or accelerated formalism to achieve SE. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of reinforcement learning in solar physics that directly solves for a fundamental physical constraint.

Abstract: Recent advancements in information availability and computational capabilities have transformed the analysis of annual reports, integrating traditional financial metrics with insights from textual data. To extract valuable insights from this wealth of textual data, automated review processes, such as topic modeling, are crucial. This study examines the effectiveness of BERTopic, a state-of-the-art topic model relying on contextual embeddings, for analyzing Item 7 and Item 7A of 10-K filings from S&amp;P 500 companies (2016-2022). Moreover, we introduce FinTextSim, a finetuned sentence-transformer model optimized for clustering and semantic search in financial contexts. Compared to all-MiniLM-L6-v2, the most widely used sentence-transformer, FinTextSim increases intratopic similarity by 81% and reduces intertopic similarity by 100%, significantly enhancing organizational clarity. We assess BERTopic's performance using embeddings from both FinTextSim and all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Our findings reveal that BERTopic only forms clear and distinct economic topic clusters when paired with FinTextSim's embeddings. Without FinTextSim, BERTopic struggles with misclassification and overlapping topics. Thus, FinTextSim is pivotal for advancing financial text analysis. FinTextSim's enhanced contextual embeddings, tailored for the financial domain, elevate the quality of future research and financial information. This improved quality of financial information will enable stakeholders to gain a competitive advantage, streamlining resource allocation and decision-making processes. Moreover, the improved insights have the potential to leverage business valuation and stock price prediction models.

Abstract: The objective of transfer learning is to enhance estimation and inference in a target data by leveraging knowledge gained from additional sources. Recent studies have explored transfer learning for independent observations in complex, high-dimensional models assuming sparsity, yet research on time series models remains limited. Our focus is on transfer learning for sequences of observations with temporal dependencies and a more intricate model parameter structure. Specifically, we investigate the vector autoregressive model (VAR), a widely recognized model for time series data, where the transition matrix can be deconstructed into a combination of a sparse matrix and a low-rank one. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm tailored for estimating high-dimensional VAR models characterized by low-rank and sparse structures. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting informative observations from auxiliary datasets. Theoretical guarantees are established, encompassing model parameter consistency, informative set selection, and the asymptotic distribution of estimators under mild conditions. The latter facilitates the construction of entry-wise confidence intervals for model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical efficacy of our methodologies through both simulated and real-world datasets.

In this work, we assess the impact of label errors in MSCOCO on the frequently used object hallucination benchmark POPE.

Abstract: Transformers have become a standard architecture in machine learning, demonstrating strong in-context learning (ICL) abilities that allow them to learn from the prompt at inference time. However, uncertainty quantification for ICL remains an open challenge, particularly in noisy regression tasks. This paper investigates whether ICL can be leveraged for distribution-free uncertainty estimation, proposing a method based on conformal prediction to construct prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. While traditional conformal methods are computationally expensive due to repeated model fitting, we exploit ICL to efficiently generate confidence intervals in a single forward pass. Our empirical analysis compares this approach against ridge regression-based conformal methods, showing that conformal prediction with in-context learning (CP with ICL) achieves robust and scalable uncertainty estimates. Additionally, we evaluate its performance under distribution shifts and establish scaling laws to guide model training. These findings bridge ICL and conformal prediction, providing a theoretically grounded and new framework for uncertainty quantification in transformer-based models.

Abstract: Respiratory auscultation is crucial for early detection of pediatric pneumonia, a condition that can quickly worsen without timely intervention. In areas with limited physician access, effective auscultation is challenging. We present a smartphone-based system that leverages built-in microphones and advanced deep learning algorithms to detect abnormal respiratory sounds indicative of pneumonia risk. Our end-to-end deep learning framework employs domain generalization to integrate a large electronic stethoscope dataset with a smaller smartphone-derived dataset, enabling robust feature learning for accurate respiratory assessments without expensive equipment. The accompanying mobile application guides caregivers in collecting high-quality lung sound samples and provides immediate feedback on potential pneumonia risks. User studies show strong classification performance and high acceptance, demonstrating the system's ability to facilitate proactive interventions and reduce preventable childhood pneumonia deaths. By seamlessly integrating into ubiquitous smartphones, this approach offers a promising avenue for more equitable and comprehensive remote pediatric care.

<title>Markov Kernels, Distances and Optimal Control: A Parable of Linear Quadratic Non-Gaussian Distribution Steering</title>

Abstract: For a controllable linear time-varying (LTV) pair $(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t)$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ positive semidefinite, we derive the Markov kernel for the It\^{o} diffusion ${\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}_t {\mathrm{d}} t + \sqrt{2}\boldsymbol{B}_{t}{\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ with an accompanying killing of probability mass at rate $\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}$. This Markov kernel is the Green's function for an associated linear reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation. Our result generalizes the recently derived kernel for the special case $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t\right)=\left(\boldsymbol{0},\boldsymbol{I}\right)$, and depends on the solution of an associated Riccati matrix ODE. A consequence of this result is that the linear quadratic non-Gaussian Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is exactly solvable. This means that the problem of steering a controlled LTV diffusion from a given non-Gaussian distribution to another over a fixed deadline while minimizing an expected quadratic cost can be solved using dynamic Sinkhorn recursions performed with the derived kernel. Our derivation for the $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t,\boldsymbol{Q}_t\right)$-parametrized kernel pursues a new idea that relies on finding a state-time dependent distance-like functional given by the solution of a deterministic optimal control problem. This technique breaks away from existing methods, such as generalizing Hermite polynomials or Weyl calculus, which have seen limited success in the reaction-diffusion context. Our technique uncovers a new connection between Markov kernels, distances, and optimal control. This connection is of interest beyond its immediate application in solving the linear quadratic Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA. We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code, training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

Abstract: Distributed systems, such as biological and artificial neural networks, process information via complex interactions engaging multiple subsystems, resulting in high-order patterns with distinct properties across scales. Investigating how these systems process information remains challenging due to difficulties in defining appropriate multivariate metrics and ensuring their scalability to large systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework based on what we call "Shannon invariants" -- quantities that capture essential properties of high-order information processing in a way that depends only on the definition of entropy and can be efficiently calculated for large systems. Our theoretical results demonstrate how Shannon invariants can be used to resolve long-standing ambiguities regarding the interpretation of widely used multivariate information-theoretic measures. Moreover, our practical results reveal distinctive information-processing signatures of various deep learning architectures across layers, which lead to new insights into how these systems process information and how this evolves during training. Overall, our framework resolves fundamental limitations in analyzing high-order phenomena and offers broad opportunities for theoretical developments and empirical analyses.

<title>Locating and Mitigating Gradient Conflicts in Point Cloud Domain Adaptation via Saliency Map Skewness</title>

Abstract: Object classification models utilizing point cloud data are fundamental for 3D media understanding, yet they often struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Existing point cloud unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods typically employ a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that combines primary classification tasks with auxiliary self-supervision tasks to bridge the gap between cross-domain feature distributions. However, our further experiments demonstrate that not all gradients from self-supervision tasks are beneficial and some may negatively impact the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a novel solution, termed Saliency Map-based Data Sampling Block (SM-DSB), to mitigate these gradient conflicts. Specifically, our method designs a new scoring mechanism based on the skewness of 3D saliency maps to estimate gradient conflicts without requiring target labels. Leveraging this, we develop a sample selection strategy that dynamically filters out samples whose self-supervision gradients are not beneficial for the classification. Our approach is scalable, introducing modest computational overhead, and can be integrated into all the point cloud UDA MTL frameworks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, we provide a new perspective on understanding the UDA problem through back-propagation analysis.

Abstract: Prompt engineering for large language models is challenging, as even small prompt perturbations or model changes can significantly impact the generated output texts. Existing evaluation methods, either automated metrics or human evaluation, have limitations, such as providing limited insights or being labor-intensive. We propose Spotlight, a new approach that combines both automation and human analysis. Based on data mining techniques, we automatically distinguish between random (decoding) variations and systematic differences in language model outputs. This process provides token patterns that describe the systematic differences and guide the user in manually analyzing the effects of their prompt and model changes efficiently. We create three benchmarks to quantitatively test the reliability of token pattern extraction methods and demonstrate that our approach provides new insights into established prompt data. From a human-centric perspective, through demonstration studies and a user study, we show that our token pattern approach helps users understand the systematic differences of language model outputs, and we are able to discover relevant differences caused by prompt and model changes (e.g. related to gender or culture), thus supporting the prompt engineering process and human-centric model behavior research.

Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) updates the velocity model by minimizing the discrepancy between observed and simulated data. However, discretization errors in numerical modeling and incomplete seismic data acquisition can introduce noise, which propagates through the adjoint operator and affects the accuracy of the velocity gradient, thereby impacting the FWI inversion accuracy. To mitigate the influence of noise on the gradient, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine the velocity model before performing the forward simulation, aiming to reduce noise and provide a more accurate velocity update direction. We use the same data misfit loss to update both the velocity and network parameters, thereby forming a self-supervised learning procedure. We propose two implementation schemes, which differ in whether the velocity update passes through the CNN. In both methodologies, the velocity representation is extended (VRE) by using a neural network in addition to the grid-based velocities. Thus, we refer to this general approach as VRE-FWI. Synthetic and real data tests demonstrate that the proposed VRE-FWI achieves higher velocity inversion accuracy compared to traditional FWI, at a marginal additional computational cost of approximately 1%.

Abstract: Event cameras offer a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) due to their ability to detect blur-free 3D edges at high-speed and over broad illumination conditions. However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction. Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets) demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable progress in the field of medical imaging. However, adapting DL models to medical tasks remains a significant challenge, primarily due to two key factors: (1) architecture selection, as different tasks necessitate specialized model designs, and (2) weight initialization, which directly impacts the convergence speed and final performance of the models. Although transfer learning from ImageNet is a widely adopted strategy, its effectiveness is constrained by the substantial differences between natural and medical images. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Neural Network Search (MedNNS), the first Neural Network Search framework for medical imaging applications. MedNNS jointly optimizes architecture selection and weight initialization by constructing a meta-space that encodes datasets and models based on how well they perform together. We build this space using a Supernetwork-based approach, expanding the model zoo size by 51x times over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Moreover, we introduce rank loss and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) loss into the construction of the space to capture inter-model and inter-dataset relationships, thereby achieving more accurate alignment in the meta-space. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that MedNNS significantly outperforms both ImageNet pre-trained DL models and SOTA Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 1.7% across datasets while converging substantially faster. The code and the processed meta-space is available at https://github.com/BioMedIA-MBZUAI/MedNNS.

Abstract: Processing visual data often involves small adjustments or sequences of changes, such as in image filtering, surface smoothing, and video storage. While established graphics techniques like normal mapping and video compression exploit redundancy to encode such small changes efficiently, the problem of encoding small changes to neural fields (NF) -- neural network parameterizations of visual or physical functions -- has received less attention.
  We propose a parameter-efficient strategy for updating neural fields using low-rank adaptations (LoRA). LoRA, a method from the parameter-efficient fine-tuning LLM community, encodes small updates to pre-trained models with minimal computational overhead. We adapt LoRA to instance-specific neural fields, avoiding the need for large pre-trained models yielding a pipeline suitable for low-compute hardware.
  We validate our approach with experiments in image filtering, video compression, and geometry editing, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility for representing neural field updates.

Abstract: AI-based systems, such as Google's GenCast, have recently redefined the state of the art in weather forecasting, offering more accurate and timely predictions of both everyday weather and extreme events. While these systems are on the verge of replacing traditional meteorological methods, they also introduce new vulnerabilities into the forecasting process. In this paper, we investigate this threat and present a novel attack on autoregressive diffusion models, such as those used in GenCast, capable of manipulating weather forecasts and fabricating extreme events, including hurricanes, heat waves, and intense rainfall. The attack introduces subtle perturbations into weather observations that are statistically indistinguishable from natural noise and change less than 0.1% of the measurements - comparable to tampering with data from a single meteorological satellite. As modern forecasting integrates data from nearly a hundred satellites and many other sources operated by different countries, our findings highlight a critical security risk with the potential to cause large-scale disruptions and undermine public trust in weather prediction.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic transition of motifs in temporal graphs is essential for revealing how graph structures evolve over time, identifying critical patterns, and predicting future behaviors, yet existing methods often focus on predefined motifs, limiting their ability to comprehensively capture transitions and interrelationships. We propose a parallel motif transition process discovery algorithm, PTMT, a novel parallel method for discovering motif transition processes in large-scale temporal graphs. PTMT integrates a tree-based framework with the temporal zone partitioning (TZP) strategy, which partitions temporal graphs by time and structure while preserving lossless motif transitions and enabling massive parallelism. PTMT comprises three phases: growth zone parallel expansion, overlap-aware result aggregation, and deterministic encoding of motif transitions, ensuring accurate tracking of dynamic transitions and interactions. Results on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTMT achieves speedups ranging from 12.0$\times$ to 50.3$\times$ compared to the SOTA method.

Abstract: In recent years, the application of Deep Learning techniques has shown remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, paving the way for their deployment in extraterrestrial exploration. Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful strategy for addressing the scarcity of labeled data in these novel environments. This paper represents one of the first efforts in evaluating the feasibility of employing adapters toward efficient transfer learning for rock segmentation in extraterrestrial landscapes, mainly focusing on lunar and martian terrains. Our work suggests that the use of adapters, strategically integrated into a pre-trained backbone model, can be successful in reducing both bandwidth and memory requirements for the target extraterrestrial device. In this study, we considered two memory-saving strategies: layer fusion (to reduce to zero the inference overhead) and an ``adapter ranking'' (to also reduce the transmission cost). Finally, we evaluate these results in terms of task performance, memory, and computation on embedded devices, evidencing trade-offs that open the road to more research in the field.

Abstract: This paper investigates the capability of Neural Networks (NNs) as alternatives to the traditional methods to analyse the performance of aerofoils used in the wind and tidal energy industry. The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANS {\tt arXiv:2212.07564v3} dataset is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$). to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the testing phase, but underperformed during validation. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL)-the ability of transformer-based models to perform new tasks from examples provided at inference time-has emerged as a hallmark of modern language models. While recent works have investigated the mechanisms underlying ICL, its feasibility under formal privacy constraints remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a differentially private pretraining algorithm for linear attention heads and present the first theoretical analysis of the privacy-accuracy trade-off for ICL in linear regression. Our results characterize the fundamental tension between optimization and privacy-induced noise, formally capturing behaviors observed in private training via iterative methods. Additionally, we show that our method is robust to adversarial perturbations of training prompts, unlike standard ridge regression. All theoretical findings are supported by extensive simulations across diverse settings.

Abstract: We develop a model where firms determine the price at which they sell their differentiable goods, the volume that they produce, and the inputs (types and amounts) that they purchase from other firms. A steady-state production network emerges endogenously without resorting to assumptions such as equilibrium or perfect knowledge about production technologies. Through a simple version of reinforcement learning, firms with heterogeneous technologies cope with uncertainty and maximize profits. Due to this learning process, firms can adapt to shocks such as demand shifts, suppliers/clients closure, productivity changes, and production technology modifications; effectively reshaping the production network. To demonstrate the potential of this model, we analyze the upstream and downstream impact of demand and productivity shocks.

Abstract: Determining the most effective Large Language Model for code smell detection presents a complex challenge. This study introduces a structured methodology and evaluation matrix to tackle this issue, leveraging a curated dataset of code samples consistently annotated with known smells. The dataset spans four prominent programming languages Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++; allowing for cross language comparison. We benchmark two state of the art LLMs, OpenAI GPT 4.0 and DeepSeek-V3, using precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. Our analysis covers three levels of detail: overall performance, category level performance, and individual code smell type performance. Additionally, we explore cost effectiveness by comparing the token based detection approach of GPT 4.0 with the pattern-matching techniques employed by DeepSeek V3. The study also includes a cost analysis relative to traditional static analysis tools such as SonarQube. The findings offer valuable guidance for practitioners in selecting an efficient, cost effective solution for automated code smell detection

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials, particularly those based on deep equivariant neural networks, have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy and computational efficiency in atomistic modeling tasks like molecular dynamics and high-throughput screening. The size of datasets and demands of downstream workflows are growing rapidly, making robust and scalable software essential. This work presents a major overhaul of the NequIP framework focusing on multi-node parallelism, computational performance, and extensibility. The redesigned framework supports distributed training on large datasets and removes barriers preventing full utilization of the PyTorch 2.0 compiler at train time. We demonstrate this acceleration in a case study by training Allegro models on the SPICE 2 dataset of organic molecular systems. For inference, we introduce the first end-to-end infrastructure that uses the PyTorch Ahead-of-Time Inductor compiler for machine learning interatomic potentials. Additionally, we implement a custom kernel for the Allegro model's most expensive operation, the tensor product. Together, these advancements speed up molecular dynamics calculations on system sizes of practical relevance by up to a factor of 18.

Abstract: We describe the use of an unsupervised Random Forest for similarity learning and improved unsupervised anomaly detection. By training a Random Forest to discriminate between real data and synthetic data sampled from a uniform distribution over the real data bounds, a distance measure is obtained that anisometrically transforms the data, expanding distances at the boundary of the data manifold. We show that using distances recovered from this transformation improves the accuracy of unsupervised anomaly detection, compared to other commonly used detectors, demonstrated over a large number of benchmark datasets. As well as improved performance, this method has advantages over other unsupervised anomaly detection methods, including minimal requirements for data preprocessing, native handling of missing data, and potential for visualizations. By relating outlier scores to partitions of the Random Forest, we develop a method for locally explainable anomaly predictions in terms of feature importance.

<title>MMInference: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context VLMs via Modality-Aware Permutation Sparse Attention</title>

Abstract: The integration of long-context capabilities with visual understanding unlocks unprecedented potential for Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, the quadratic attention complexity during the pre-filling phase remains a significant obstacle to real-world deployment. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MMInference (Multimodality Million tokens Inference), a dynamic sparse attention method that accelerates the prefilling stage for long-context multi-modal inputs. First, our analysis reveals that the temporal and spatial locality of video input leads to a unique sparse pattern, the Grid pattern. Simultaneously, VLMs exhibit markedly different sparse distributions across different modalities. We introduce a permutation-based method to leverage the unique Grid pattern and handle modality boundary issues. By offline search the optimal sparse patterns for each head, MMInference constructs the sparse distribution dynamically based on the input. We also provide optimized GPU kernels for efficient sparse computations. Notably, MMInference integrates seamlessly into existing VLM pipelines without any model modifications or fine-tuning. Experiments on multi-modal benchmarks-including Video QA, Captioning, VisionNIAH, and Mixed-Modality NIAH-with state-of-the-art long-context VLMs (LongVila, LlavaVideo, VideoChat-Flash, Qwen2.5-VL) show that MMInference accelerates the pre-filling stage by up to 8.3x at 1M tokens while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/MMInference.

Abstract: This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 159% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the Maj@N metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks, and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains. GitHub: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL

Abstract: Over the past few years, the federated learning ($\texttt{FL}$) community has witnessed a proliferation of new $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. However, our understating of the theory of $\texttt{FL}$ is still fragmented, and a thorough, formal comparison of these algorithms remains elusive. Motivated by this gap, we show that many of the existing $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms can be understood from an operator splitting point of view. This unification allows us to compare different algorithms with ease, to refine previous convergence results and to uncover new algorithmic variants. In particular, our analysis reveals the vital role played by the step size in $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. The unification also leads to a streamlined and economic way to accelerate $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms, without incurring any communication overhead. We perform numerical experiments on both convex and nonconvex models to validate our findings.

Abstract: These days with the rising computational capabilities of wireless user equipment such as smart phones, tablets, and vehicles, along with growing concerns about sharing private data, a novel machine learning model called federated learning (FL) has emerged. FL enables the separation of data acquisition and computation at the central unit, which is different from centralized learning that occurs in a data center. FL is typically used in a wireless edge network where communication resources are limited and unreliable. Bandwidth constraints necessitate scheduling only a subset of UEs for updates in each iteration, and because the wireless medium is shared, transmissions are susceptible to interference and are not assured. The article discusses the significance of Machine Learning in wireless communication and highlights Federated Learning (FL) as a novel approach that could play a vital role in future mobile networks, particularly 6G and beyond.

<title>Building symmetries into data-driven manifold dynamics models for complex flows: application to two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow</title>

Abstract: Data-driven reduced-order models of the dynamics of complex flows are important for tasks related to design, understanding, prediction, and control. Many flows obey symmetries, and the present work illustrates how these can be exploited to yield highly efficient low-dimensional data-driven models for chaotic flows. In particular, incorporating symmetries both guarantees that the reduced order model automatically respects them and dramatically increases the effective density of data sampling. Given data for the long-time dynamics of a system, and knowing the set of continuous and discrete symmetries it obeys, the first step in the methodology is to identify a "fundamental chart", a region in the state space of the flow to which all other regions can be mapped by a symmetry operation, and a set of criteria indicating what mapping takes each point in state space into that chart. We then find a low-dimensional coordinate representation of the data in the fundamental chart with the use of an autoencoder architecture that also provides an estimate of the dimension of the invariant manifold where data lie. Finally, we learn dynamics on this manifold with the use of neural ordinary differential equations. We apply this method, denoted "symmetry charting" to simulation data from two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow in a chaotic bursting regime. This system has a continuous translation symmetry, and discrete rotation and shift-reflect symmetries. With this framework we observe that less data is needed to learn accurate data-driven models, more robust estimates of the manifold dimension are obtained, equivariance of the NSE is satisfied, better short-time tracking with respect to the true data is observed, and long-time statistics are correctly captured.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on learning state-dependent policies to solve optimal control problems in a closed-loop fashion. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of open-loop reinforcement learning where a fixed action sequence is learned instead. We present three new algorithms: one robust model-based method and two sample-efficient model-free methods. Rather than basing our algorithms on Bellman's equation from dynamic programming, our work builds on Pontryagin's principle from the theory of open-loop optimal control. We provide convergence guarantees and evaluate all methods empirically on a pendulum swing-up task, as well as on two high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data such as satellite imagery can have far-reaching impacts on our understanding of the geography of poverty, especially when coupled with machine learning (ML) and computer vision. Early research used computer vision to predict living conditions in areas with limited data, but recent studies increasingly focus on causal analysis. Despite this shift, the use of EO-ML methods for causal inference lacks thorough documentation, and best practices are still developing. Through a comprehensive scoping review, we catalog the current literature on EO-ML methods in causal analysis. We synthesize five principal approaches to incorporating EO data in causal workflows: (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. Building on these findings, we provide a detailed protocol guiding researchers in integrating EO data into causal analysis -- covering data requirements, computer vision model selection, and evaluation metrics. While our focus centers on health and living conditions outcomes, our protocol is adaptable to other sustainable development domains utilizing EO data.

Abstract: Subsampling is commonly used to mitigate costs associated with data acquisition, such as time or energy requirements, motivating the development of algorithms for estimating the fully-sampled signal of interest $x$ from partially observed measurements $y$. In maximum entropy sampling, one selects measurement locations that are expected to have the highest entropy, so as to minimize uncertainty about $x$. This approach relies on an accurate model of the posterior distribution over future measurements, given the measurements observed so far. Recently, diffusion models have been shown to produce high-quality posterior samples of high-dimensional signals using guided diffusion. In this work, we propose Active Diffusion Subsampling (ADS), a method for designing intelligent subsampling masks using guided diffusion in which the model tracks a distribution of beliefs over the true state of $x$ throughout the reverse diffusion process, progressively decreasing its uncertainty by actively choosing to acquire measurements with maximum expected entropy, ultimately producing the posterior distribution $p(x \mid y)$. ADS can be applied using pre-trained diffusion models for any subsampling rate, and does not require task-specific retraining - just the specification of a measurement model. Furthermore, the maximum entropy sampling policy employed by ADS is interpretable, enhancing transparency relative to existing methods using black-box policies. Code is available at https://active-diffusion-subsampling.github.io/.

Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of distributed microservice architectures within the industry has significantly increased the demand for enhanced system availability and robustness. Due to the complex service invocation paths and dependencies in enterprise-level microservice systems, it is challenging to locate the anomalies promptly during service invocations, thus causing intractable issues for normal system operations and maintenance. In this paper, we propose a Causal Heterogeneous grAph baSed framEwork for root cause analysis, namely CHASE, for microservice systems with multimodal data, including traces, logs, and system monitoring metrics. Specifically, related information is encoded into representative embeddings and further modeled by a multimodal invocation graph. Following that, anomaly detection is performed on each instance node with attentive heterogeneous message passing from its adjacent metric and log nodes. Finally, CHASE learns from the constructed hypergraph with hyperedges representing the flow of causality and performs root cause localization. We evaluate the proposed framework on two public microservice datasets with distinct attributes and compare with the state-of-the-art methods. The results show that CHASE achieves the average performance gain up to 36.2%(A@1) and 29.4%(Percentage@1), respectively to its best counterpart.

Abstract: The rapid progress in machine learning (ML) has brought forth many large language models (LLMs) that excel in various tasks and areas. These LLMs come with different abilities and costs in terms of computation or pricing. Since the demand for each query can vary, e.g., because of the queried domain or its complexity, defaulting to one LLM in an application is not usually the best choice, whether it is the biggest, priciest, or even the one with the best average test performance. Consequently, picking the right LLM that is both accurate and cost-effective for an application is necessary yet remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce MetaLLM, a framework that dynamically and intelligently routes each query to the optimal LLM (among several available LLMs) for classification and multi-choice question-answering tasks, achieving significantly improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness. By framing the selection problem as a multi-armed bandit, MetaLLM balances prediction accuracy and cost efficiency under uncertainty. Our experiments, conducted on popular LLM platforms such as OpenAI and Together AI, as well as open-source LLM, showcase MetaLLM's efficacy in real-world scenarios, laying the groundwork for future extensions.

Abstract: We present RLHFuse, an efficient training system with stage fusion for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization. RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to overlap the execution of generation and inference stages, thus mitigating the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches and performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, effectively mitigating the pipeline bubbles. The experiments show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to $3.7\times$, compared to existing systems.

Abstract: Peer-to-peer learning is an increasingly popular framework that enables beyond-5G distributed edge devices to collaboratively train deep neural networks in a privacy-preserving manner without the aid of a central server. Neural network training algorithms for emerging environments, e.g., smart cities, have many design considerations that are difficult to tune in deployment settings -- such as neural network architectures and hyperparameters. This presents a critical need for characterizing the training dynamics of distributed optimization algorithms used to train highly nonconvex neural networks in peer-to-peer learning environments. In this work, we provide an explicit characterization of the learning dynamics of wide neural networks trained using popular distributed gradient descent (DGD) algorithms. Our results leverage both recent advancements in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and extensive previous work on distributed learning and consensus. We validate our analytical results by accurately predicting the parameter and error dynamics of wide neural networks trained for classification tasks.

Abstract: It has been reported that LLMs can recognize their own writing. As this has potential implications for AI safety, yet is relatively understudied, we investigate the phenomenon, seeking to establish whether it robustly occurs at the behavioral level, how the observed behavior is achieved, and whether it can be controlled. First, we find that the Llama3-8b-Instruct chat model - but not the base Llama3-8b model - can reliably distinguish its own outputs from those of humans, and present evidence that the chat model is likely using its experience with its own outputs, acquired during post-training, to succeed at the writing recognition task. Second, we identify a vector in the residual stream of the model that is differentially activated when the model makes a correct self-written-text recognition judgment, show that the vector activates in response to information relevant to self-authorship, present evidence that the vector is related to the concept of "self" in the model, and demonstrate that the vector is causally related to the model's ability to perceive and assert self-authorship. Finally, we show that the vector can be used to control both the model's behavior and its perception, steering the model to claim or disclaim authorship by applying the vector to the model's output as it generates it, and steering the model to believe or disbelieve it wrote arbitrary texts by applying the vector to them as the model reads them.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant approach for language model (LM) alignment. At its core, RLHF uses a margin-based loss for preference optimization, specifying ideal LM behavior only by the difference between preferred and dispreferred responses. In this paper, we identify a common pitfall of margin-based methods -- the under-specification of ideal LM behavior on preferred and dispreferred responses individually, which leads to two unintended consequences as the margin increases: (1) The probability of dispreferred (e.g., unsafe) responses may increase, resulting in potential safety alignment failures. (2) The probability of preferred responses may decrease, even when those responses are ideal. We demystify the reasons behind these problematic behaviors: margin-based losses couple the change in the preferred probability to the gradient of the dispreferred one, and vice versa, often preventing the preferred probability from increasing while the dispreferred one decreases, and thus causing a synchronized increase or decrease in both probabilities. We term this effect, inherent in margin-based objectives, gradient entanglement. Formally, we derive conditions for general margin-based alignment objectives under which gradient entanglement becomes concerning: the inner product of the gradients of preferred and dispreferred log-probabilities is large relative to the individual gradient norms. We theoretically investigate why such inner products can be large when aligning language models and empirically validate our findings. Empirical implications of our framework extend to explaining important differences in the training dynamics of various preference optimization algorithms, and suggesting potential algorithm designs to mitigate the under-specification issue of margin-based methods and thereby improving language model alignment.

Abstract: Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is widely recognized for its robust performance across a range of deep reinforcement learning tasks, where it leverages the tanh transformation to constrain actions within bounded limits. However, this transformation induces a distribution shift, distorting the original Gaussian action distribution and potentially leading the policy to select suboptimal actions, particularly in high-dimensional action spaces. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of this distribution shift, deriving the precise probability density function (PDF) for actions following the tanh transformation to clarify the misalignment introduced between the transformed distribution's mode and the intended action output. We substantiate these theoretical insights through extensive experiments on high-dimensional tasks within the HumanoidBench benchmark. Our findings indicate that accounting for this distribution shift substantially enhances SAC's performance, resulting in notable improvements in cumulative rewards, sample efficiency, and reliability across tasks. These results underscore a critical consideration for SAC and similar algorithms: addressing transformation-induced distribution shifts is essential to optimizing policy effectiveness in high-dimensional deep reinforcement learning environments, thereby expanding the robustness and applicability of SAC in complex control tasks.

Abstract: Vertical federated learning trains models from feature-partitioned datasets across multiple clients, who collaborate without sharing their local data. Standard approaches assume that all feature partitions are available during both training and inference. Yet, in practice, this assumption rarely holds, as for many samples only a subset of the clients observe their partition. However, not utilizing incomplete samples during training harms generalization, and not supporting them during inference limits the utility of the model. Moreover, if any client leaves the federation after training, its partition becomes unavailable, rendering the learned model unusable. Missing feature blocks are therefore a key challenge limiting the applicability of vertical federated learning in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose LASER-VFL, a vertical federated learning method for efficient training and inference of split neural network-based models that is capable of handling arbitrary sets of partitions. Our approach is simple yet effective, relying on the sharing of model parameters and on task-sampling to train a family of predictors. We show that LASER-VFL achieves a $\mathcal{O}({1}/{\sqrt{T}})$ convergence rate for nonconvex objectives and, under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, it achieves linear convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Numerical experiments show improved performance of LASER-VFL over the baselines. Remarkably, this is the case even in the absence of missing features. For example, for CIFAR-100, we see an improvement in accuracy of $19.3\%$ when each of four feature blocks is observed with a probability of 0.5 and of $9.5\%$ when all features are observed.

Abstract: During the COVID-19 crisis, mechanistic models have guided evidence-based decision making. However, time-critical decisions in a dynamical environment limit the time available to gather supporting evidence. Infectious disease dynamics are often heterogeneous on a spatial or demographic scale, requiring appropriately resolved models. In addition, with a large number of potential interventions, all scenarios can barely be computed on time, even when using supercomputing facilities. We suggest to couple complex mechanistic models with data-driven surrogate models to allow for on-the-fly model adaptations by public health experts and decision makers. We build upon a spatially and demographically resolved infectious disease metapopulation model and train a graph neural network for data sets representing prevaccination phases of a pandemic. The resulting networks reached an execution time of a fraction of a second, a speeding up the metapopulation up to four orders of magnitude. The approach yields large potential for on-the-fly execution and, thus, facilitates integration into low-barrier web applications for use in pandemic decision-making.

Abstract: In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), an agent seeks to replicate expert demonstrations through interactions with the environment. Traditionally, IRL is treated as an adversarial game, where an adversary searches over reward models, and a learner optimizes the reward through repeated RL procedures. This game-solving approach is both computationally expensive and difficult to stabilize. In this work, we propose a novel approach to IRL by direct policy optimization: exploiting a linear factorization of the return as the inner product of successor features and a reward vector, we design an IRL algorithm by policy gradient descent on the gap between the learner and expert features. Our non-adversarial method does not require learning a reward function and can be solved seamlessly with existing actor-critic RL algorithms. Remarkably, our approach works in state-only settings without expert action labels, a setting which behavior cloning (BC) cannot solve. Empirical results demonstrate that our method learns from as few as a single expert demonstration and achieves improved performance on various control tasks.

Abstract: We discuss several aspects of the loss landscape of regularized neural networks: the structure of stationary points, connectivity of optimal solutions, path with nonincreasing loss to arbitrary global optimum, and the nonuniqueness of optimal solutions, by casting the problem into an equivalent convex problem and considering its dual. Starting from two-layer neural networks with scalar output, we first characterize the solution set of the convex problem using its dual and further characterize all stationary points. With the characterization, we show that the topology of the global optima goes through a phase transition as the width of the network changes, and construct counterexamples where the problem may have a continuum of optimal solutions. Finally, we show that the solution set characterization and connectivity results can be extended to different architectures, including two-layer vector-valued neural networks and parallel three-layer neural networks.

Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AutoFE) is used to automatically create new features from original features to improve predictive performance without needing significant human intervention and domain expertise. Many algorithms exist for AutoFE, but very few approaches exist for the federated learning (FL) setting where data is gathered across many clients and is not shared between clients or a central server. We introduce AutoFE algorithms for the horizontal, vertical, and hybrid FL settings, which differ in how the data is gathered across clients. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop AutoFE algorithms for the horizontal and hybrid FL cases, and we show that the downstream test scores of our federated AutoFE algorithms is close in performance to the case where data is held centrally and AutoFE is performed centrally.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example,financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning and a method of detection by dynamic systems and statistical analysis of the distribution of data. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning has emerged as a promising approach that shares lightweight prototypes to transfer knowledge among clients with data heterogeneity in a model-agnostic manner. However, existing methods often collect prototypes directly from local models, which inevitably introduce inconsistencies into representation learning due to the biased data distributions and differing model architectures among clients. In this paper, we identify that both statistical and model heterogeneity create a vicious cycle of representation inconsistency, classifier divergence, and skewed prototype alignment, which negatively impacts the performance of clients. To break the vicious cycle, we propose a novel framework named Federated Learning via Semantic Anchors (FedSA) to decouple the generation of prototypes from local representation learning. We introduce a novel perspective that uses simple yet effective semantic anchors serving as prototypes to guide local models in learning consistent representations. By incorporating semantic anchors, we further propose anchor-based regularization with margin-enhanced contrastive learning and anchor-based classifier calibration to correct feature extractors and calibrate classifiers across clients, achieving intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of prototypes while ensuring consistent decision boundaries. We then update the semantic anchors with these consistent and discriminative prototypes, which iteratively encourage clients to collaboratively learn a unified data representation with robust generalization. Extensive experiments under both statistical and model heterogeneity settings show that FedSA significantly outperforms existing prototype-based FL methods on various classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep-learning-based nonlinear system identification has shown the ability to produce reliable and highly accurate models in practice. However, these black-box models lack physical interpretability, and a considerable part of the learning effort is often spent on capturing already expected/known behavior of the system, that can be accurately described by first-principles laws of physics. A potential solution is to directly integrate such prior physical knowledge into the model structure, combining the strengths of physics-based modeling and deep-learning-based identification. The most common approach is to use an additive model augmentation structure, where the physics-based and the machine-learning (ML) components are connected in parallel, i.e., additively. However, such models are overparametrized, training them is challenging, potentially causing the physics-based part to lose interpretability. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an orthogonal projection-based regularization technique to enhance parameter learning and even model accuracy in learning-based augmentation of nonlinear baseline models.

Abstract: Kernel-free quadratic surface support vector machine (SVM) models have gained significant attention in machine learning. However, introducing a quadratic classifier increases the model's complexity by quadratically expanding the number of parameters relative to the dimensionality of the data, exacerbating overfitting. Hence, we propose sparse $\ell_0$-norm based Kernel-free quadratic surface SVMs, designed to mitigate overfitting and enhance interpretability. Given the intractable nature of these models, we present a penalty decomposition algorithm to obtain first-order optimality points efficiently. We demonstrate that the subproblems in our framework either admit closed-form solutions or can leverage duality theory to improve computational efficiency. Through empirical evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach, showcasing its potential to advance Kernel-free quadratic surface SVMs in practical applications while addressing overfitting concerns. All the implemented models and experiment codes are available at https://github.com/raminzandvakili/L0-QSVM.

Abstract: Flow matching has shown state-of-the-art performance in various generative tasks, ranging from image generation to decision-making, where guided generation is pivotal. However, the guidance of flow matching is more general than and thus substantially different from that of its predecessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge in guidance for general flow matching remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first framework of general guidance for flow matching. From this framework, we derive a family of guidance techniques that can be applied to general flow matching. These include a new training-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel training losses for training-based guidance, and two classes of approximate guidance that cover classical gradient guidance methods as special cases. We theoretically investigate these different methods to give a practical guideline for choosing suitable methods in different scenarios. Experiments on synthetic datasets, image inverse problems, and offline reinforcement learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance methods and verify the correctness of our flow matching guidance framework. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/flow_guidance.

We show how to transfer a KAN and the necessary associated mechanisms into the complex domain. To confirm that CVKAN meets expectations we conduct experiments on symbolic complex-valued function fitting and physically meaningful formulae as well as on a more realistic dataset from knot theory. Our proposed CVKAN is more stable and performs on par or better than real-valued KANs while requiring less parameters and a shallower network architecture, making it more explainable.

Abstract: Multi-task learning enables the acquisition of task-generic knowledge by training multiple tasks within a unified architecture. However, training all tasks together in a single architecture can lead to performance degradation, known as negative transfer, which is a main concern in multi-task learning. Previous works have addressed this issue by optimizing the multi-task network through gradient manipulation or weighted loss adjustments. However, their optimization strategy focuses on addressing task imbalance in shared parameters, neglecting the learning of task-specific parameters. As a result, they show limitations in mitigating negative transfer, since the learning of shared space and task-specific information influences each other during optimization. To address this, we propose a different approach to enhance multi-task performance by selectively grouping tasks and updating them for each batch during optimization. We introduce an algorithm that adaptively determines how to effectively group tasks and update them during the learning process. To track inter-task relations and optimize multi-task networks simultaneously, we propose proximal inter-task affinity, which can be measured during the optimization process. We provide a theoretical analysis on how dividing tasks into multiple groups and updating them sequentially significantly affects multi-task performance by enhancing the learning of task-specific parameters. Our methods substantially outperform previous multi-task optimization approaches and are scalable to different architectures and various numbers of tasks.

To address these gaps, we introduce FOReCAst (Future Outcome Reasoning and Confidence Assessment), a benchmark that evaluates models' ability to make predictions and their confidence in them. FOReCAst spans diverse forecasting scenarios involving Boolean questions, timeframe prediction, and quantity estimation, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of both prediction accuracy and confidence calibration for real-world applications.

Abstract: To go from (passive) process monitoring to active process control, an effective AI system must learn about the behavior of the complex system from very limited training data, forming an ad-hoc digital twin with respect to process inputs and outputs that captures the consequences of actions on the process's world. We propose a novel methodology based on learning world models that disentangles process parameters in the learned latent representation, allowing for fine-grained control. Representation learning is driven by the latent factors influencing the processes through contrastive learning within a joint embedding predictive architecture. This makes changes in representations predictable from changes in inputs and vice versa, facilitating interpretability of key factors responsible for process variations, paving the way for effective control actions to keep the process within operational bounds. The effectiveness of our method is validated on the example of plastic injection molding, demonstrating practical relevance in proposing specific control actions for a notoriously unstable process.

<title>Not All Edges are Equally Robust: Evaluating the Robustness of Ranking-Based Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Ranking Learning (FRL) is a state-of-the-art FL framework that stands out for its communication efficiency and resilience to poisoning attacks. It diverges from the traditional FL framework in two ways: 1) it leverages discrete rankings instead of gradient updates, significantly reducing communication costs and limiting the potential space for malicious updates, and 2) it uses majority voting on the server side to establish the global ranking, ensuring that individual updates have minimal influence since each client contributes only a single vote. These features enhance the system's scalability and position FRL as a promising paradigm for FL training.
  However, our analysis reveals that FRL is not inherently robust, as certain edges are particularly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Through a theoretical investigation, we prove the existence of these vulnerable edges and establish a lower bound and an upper bound for identifying them in each layer. Based on this finding, we introduce a novel local model poisoning attack against FRL, namely the Vulnerable Edge Manipulation (VEM) attack. The VEM attack focuses on identifying and perturbing the most vulnerable edges in each layer and leveraging an optimization-based approach to maximize the attack's impact. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our attack achieves an overall 53.23% attack impact and is 3.7x more impactful than existing methods. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in ranking-based FL systems and underline the urgency for the development of new robust FL frameworks.

Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for many industrial applications, but a significant portion of their computational cost stems from the time needed to reach statistical steadiness from initial conditions. We present a novel machine learning-based initialization method that reduces the cost of this subsequent transient solve substantially, achieving a 50% reduction in time-to-convergence compared to traditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Through a case study in automotive aerodynamics using a 16.7M-cell unsteady RANS simulation, we evaluate three ML-based initialization strategies. Two of these strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a physics-informed hybrid method combining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) a more versatile approach integrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD solvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally expensive steady RANS initializations, while requiring only seconds of computation. We develop a robust statistical convergence metric based on windowed time-averaging for performance comparison between initialization strategies. Notably, these improvements are achieved using an ML model trained on a different dataset of automotive geometries, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. The proposed methods integrate seamlessly with existing CFD workflows without requiring modifications to the underlying flow solver, providing a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations through improved ML-based initialization strategies.

Abstract: RISC-V-based architectures are paving the way for efficient On-Device Learning (ODL) in smart edge devices. When applied across multiple nodes, ODL enables the creation of intelligent sensor networks that preserve data privacy. However, developing ODL-capable, battery-operated embedded platforms presents significant challenges due to constrained computational resources and limited device lifetime, besides intrinsic learning issues such as catastrophic forgetting. We face these challenges by proposing a regularization-based On-Device Federated Continual Learning algorithm tailored for multiple nano-drones performing face recognition tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a RISC-V-based 10-core ultra-low-power SoC, optimizing the ODL computational requirements. We improve the classification accuracy by 24% over naive fine-tuning, requiring 178 ms per local epoch and 10.5 s per global epoch, demonstrating the effectiveness of the architecture for this task.

Abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction plays a pivotal role in deciphering cellular functions and disease mechanisms. To address the limitations of traditional experimental methods and existing computational approaches in cross-modal feature fusion and false-negative suppression, we propose SCMPPI-a novel supervised contrastive multimodal framework. By effectively integrating sequence-based features (AAC, DPC, ESMC-CKSAAP) with network topology (Node2Vec embeddings) and incorporating an enhanced contrastive learning strategy with negative sample filtering, SCMPPI achieves superior prediction performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy(98.13%) and AUC(99.69%), along with excellent cross-species generalization (AUC>99%). Successful applications in CD9 networks, Wnt pathway analysis, and cancer-specific networks further highlight its potential for disease target discovery, establishing SCMPPI as a powerful tool for multimodal biological data analysis.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows edge devices to collaboratively train models without sharing local data. As FL gains popularity, clients may need to train multiple unrelated FL models, but communication constraints limit their ability to train all models simultaneously. While clients could train FL models sequentially, opportunistically having FL clients concurrently train different models -- termed multi-model federated learning (MMFL) -- can reduce the overall training time. Prior work uses simple client-to-model assignments that do not optimize the contribution of each client to each model over the course of its training. Prior work on single-model FL shows that intelligent client selection can greatly accelerate convergence, but na\"ive extensions to MMFL can violate heterogeneous resource constraints at both the server and the clients. In this work, we develop a novel convergence analysis of MMFL with arbitrary client sampling methods, theoretically demonstrating the strengths and limitations of previous well-established gradient-based methods. Motivated by this analysis, we propose MMFL-LVR, a loss-based sampling method that minimizes training variance while explicitly respecting communication limits at the server and reducing computational costs at the clients. We extend this to MMFL-StaleVR, which incorporates stale updates for improved efficiency and stability, and MMFL-StaleVRE, a lightweight variant suitable for low-overhead deployment. Experiments show our methods improve average accuracy by up to 19.1% over random sampling, with only a 5.4% gap from the theoretical optimum (full client participation).

Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian estimation framework for Wiener models, focusing on learning nonlinear output functions under known linear state dynamics. We derive a closed-form optimal affine estimator for the unknown parameters, characterized by the so-called "dynamic basis statistics" (DBS). Several features of the proposed estimator are studied, including Bayesian unbiasedness, closed-form posterior statistics, error monotonicity in trajectory length, and consistency condition (also known as persistent excitation). In the special case of Fourier basis functions, we demonstrate that the closed-form description is computationally available, as the Fourier DBS enjoys explicit expressions. Furthermore, we identify an inherent inconsistency in the Fourier bases for single-trajectory measurements, regardless of the input excitation. Leveraging the closed-form estimation error, we develop an active learning algorithm synthesizing input signals to minimize estimation error. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, showing significant improvements over traditional regularized least-squares methods.

Abstract: We consider a common case of the combinatorial semi-bandit problem, the $m$-set semi-bandit, where the learner exactly selects $m$ arms from the total $d$ arms. In the adversarial setting, the best regret bound, known to be $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd})$ for time horizon $n$, is achieved by the well-known Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policy. However, this requires to explicitly compute the arm-selection probabilities via optimizing problems at each time step and sample according to them. This problem can be avoided by the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy, which simply pulls the $m$ arms that rank among the $m$ smallest (estimated) loss with random perturbation. In this paper, we show that FTPL with a Fr\'echet perturbation also enjoys the near optimal regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{nmd\log(d)})$ in the adversarial setting and approaches best-of-both-world regret bounds, i.e., achieves a logarithmic regret for the stochastic setting.

Online learning methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable online learning algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.

<title>Adaptive Student's t-distribution with method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series</title>

Abstract: The real life time series are usually nonstationary, bringing a difficult question of model adaptation. Classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH assume arbitrary type of dependence. To avoid their bias, we will focus on recently proposed agnostic philosophy of moving estimator: in time $t$ finding parameters optimizing e.g. $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ moving log-likelihood, evolving in time. It allows for example to estimate parameters using inexpensive exponential moving averages (EMA), like absolute central moments $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ evolving for one or multiple powers $p\in\mathbb{R}^+$ using $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. Application of such general adaptive methods of moments will be presented on Student's t-distribution, popular especially in economical applications, here applied to log-returns of DJIA companies. While standard ARMA-ARCH approaches provide evolution of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, here we also get evolution of $\nu$ describing $\rho(x)\sim |x|^{-\nu-1}$ tail shape, probability of extreme events - which might turn out catastrophic, destabilizing the market.

<title>LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatial-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision</title>

Abstract: Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG. Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy.

Abstract: We develop empirical models that efficiently process large amounts of unstructured product data (text, images, prices, quantities) to produce accurate hedonic price estimates and derived indices. To achieve this, we generate abstract product attributes (or ``features'') from descriptions and images using deep neural networks. These attributes are then used to estimate the hedonic price function. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we apply the models to Amazon's data for first-party apparel sales, and estimate hedonic prices. The resulting models have a very high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ ranging from $80\%$ to $90\%$. Finally, we construct the AI-based hedonic Fisher price index, chained at the year-over-year frequency, and contrast it with the CPI and other electronic indices.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general observation model for restless multi-armed bandit problems. The operation of the player needs to be based on certain feedback mechanism that is error-prone due to resource constraints or environmental or intrinsic noises. By establishing a general probabilistic model for dynamics of feedback/observation, we formulate the problem as a restless bandit with a countable belief state space starting from an arbitrary initial belief (a priori information). We apply the achievable region method with partial conservation law (PCL) to the infinite-state problem and analyze its indexability and priority index (Whittle index). Finally, we propose an approximation process to transform the problem into which the AG algorithm of Ni\~no-Mora and Bertsimas for finite-state problems can be applied to. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has an excellent performance.

arXiv:2311.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of designing control policies for agents with unknown stochastic dynamics and control objectives specified using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Recent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have aimed to compute policies that maximize the satisfaction probability of LTL formulas, but they often suffer from slow learning performance. To address this, we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning algorithm that significantly improves learning speed. The enhanced sample efficiency stems from a mission-driven exploration strategy that prioritizes exploration towards directions likely to contribute to mission success. Identifying these directions relies on an automaton representation of the LTL task as well as a learned neural network that partially models the agent-environment interaction. We provide comparative experiments demonstrating the efficiency of our algorithm on robot navigation tasks in unseen environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical systems where they provide answers based on in-context information derived from knowledge bases. As LLMs are increasingly envisioned as superhuman agents, their proficiency in knowledge comprehension-extracting relevant information and reasoning over it to answer questions, a key facet of human intelligence-becomes crucial. However, existing evaluations of LLMs on knowledge comprehension are typically conducted on small test sets, but these datasets represent only a tiny fraction of the vast number of possible queries. Simple empirical evaluations on these limited test sets raises concerns about the reliability and generalizability of the results. In this work, we introduce the first specification and certification framework for knowledge comprehension in LLMs, providing formal probabilistic guarantees for reliability. Instead of a fixed dataset, we design novel specifications that mathematically represent prohibitively large probability distributions of knowledge comprehension prompts with natural noise, using knowledge graphs. From these specifications, we generate quantitative certificates that offer high-confidence, tight bounds on the probability that a given LLM correctly answers any question drawn from the specification distribution. We apply our framework to certify SOTA LLMs in two domains: precision medicine and general question-answering. Our results reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in SOTA LLMs due to natural noise in the prompts. Additionally, we establish performance hierarchies with formal guarantees among the SOTA LLMs, particularly in the context of precision medicine question-answering.

Abstract: We provide a framework for solving inverse problems with diffusion models learned from linearly corrupted data. Firstly, we extend the Ambient Diffusion framework to enable training directly from measurements corrupted in the Fourier domain. Subsequently, we train diffusion models for MRI with access only to Fourier subsampled multi-coil measurements at acceleration factors R= 2,4,6,8. Secondly, we propose Ambient Diffusion Posterior Sampling (A-DPS), a reconstruction algorithm that leverages generative models pre-trained on one type of corruption (e.g. image inpainting) to perform posterior sampling on measurements from a different forward process (e.g. image blurring). For MRI reconstruction in high acceleration regimes, we observe that A-DPS models trained on subsampled data are better suited to solving inverse problems than models trained on fully sampled data. We also test the efficacy of A-DPS on natural image datasets (CelebA, FFHQ, and AFHQ) and show that A-DPS can sometimes outperform models trained on clean data for several image restoration tasks in both speed and performance.

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, the field of process industry optimization and control is also undergoing a digital transformation. With the rise of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), its application in process control has attracted widespread attention. However, the extremely low sample efficiency and the safety concerns caused by exploration in DRL hinder its practical implementation in industrial settings. Transfer learning offers an effective solution for DRL, enhancing its generalization and adaptability in multi-mode control scenarios. This paper provides insights into the use of DRL for process control from the perspective of transfer learning. We analyze the challenges of applying DRL in the process industry and the necessity of introducing transfer learning. Furthermore, recommendations and prospects are provided for future research directions on how transfer learning can be integrated with DRL to enhance process control. This paper aims to offer a set of promising, user-friendly, easy-to-implement, and scalable approaches to artificial intelligence-facilitated industrial control for scholars and engineers in the process industry.

<title>TextSquare: Scaling up Text-Centric Visual Instruction Tuning</title>

arXiv:2404.12803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-centric visual question answering (VQA) has made great strides with the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet open-source models still fall short of leading models like GPT4V and Gemini, partly due to a lack of extensive, high-quality instruction tuning data. To this end, we introduce a new approach for creating a massive, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset, Square-10M, which is generated using closed-source MLLMs. The data construction process, termed Square, consists of four steps: Self-Questioning, Answering, Reasoning, and Evaluation. Our experiments with Square-10M led to three key findings: 1) Our model, TextSquare, considerably surpasses open-source previous state-of-the-art Text-centric MLLMs and sets a new standard on OCRBench(62.2%). It even outperforms top-tier models like GPT4V and Gemini in 6 of 10 text-centric benchmarks. 2) Additionally, we demonstrate the critical role of VQA reasoning data in offering comprehensive contextual insights for specific questions. This not only improves accuracy but also significantly mitigates hallucinations. Specifically, TextSquare scores an average of 75.1% across four general VQA and hallucination evaluation datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models. 3) Notably, the phenomenon observed in scaling text-centric VQA datasets reveals a vivid pattern: the exponential increase of instruction tuning data volume is directly proportional to the improvement in model performance, thereby validating the necessity of the dataset scale and the high quality of Square-10M.

Abstract: Interpreting the decisions of deep learning models, including audio classifiers, is crucial for ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of this technology. In this paper, we introduce LMAC-ZS (Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers in the Zero-Shot context), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first decoder-based post-hoc interpretation method for explaining the decisions of zero-shot audio classifiers. The proposed method utilizes a novel loss function that maximizes the faithfulness to the original similarity between a given text-and-audio pair. We provide an extensive evaluation using the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to showcase that our interpreter remains faithful to the decisions in a zero-shot classification context. Moreover, we qualitatively show that our method produces meaningful explanations that correlate well with different text prompts.

Abstract: We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.

<title>Certifying Counterfactual Bias in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce biased responses that can cause representational harms. However, conventional studies are insufficient to thoroughly evaluate biases across LLM responses for different demographic groups (a.k.a. counterfactual bias), as they do not scale to large number of inputs and do not provide guarantees. Therefore, we propose the first framework, LLMCert-B that certifies LLMs for counterfactual bias on distributions of prompts. A certificate consists of high-confidence bounds on the probability of unbiased LLM responses for any set of counterfactual prompts - prompts differing by demographic groups, sampled from a distribution. We illustrate counterfactual bias certification for distributions of counterfactual prompts created by applying prefixes sampled from prefix distributions, to a given set of prompts. We consider prefix distributions consisting random token sequences, mixtures of manual jailbreaks, and perturbations of jailbreaks in LLM's embedding space. We generate non-trivial certificates for SOTA LLMs, exposing their vulnerabilities over distributions of prompts generated from computationally inexpensive prefix distributions.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have inspired a surge of research into reconstructing specific quantities of interest from measurements that comply with certain physical laws. These efforts focus on inverse problems that are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop an asymptotic Sobolev norm learning curve for kernel ridge(less) regression when addressing (elliptical) linear inverse problems. Our results show that the PDE operators in the inverse problem can stabilize the variance and even behave benign overfitting for fixed-dimensional problems, exhibiting different behaviors from regression problems. Besides, our investigation also demonstrates the impact of various inductive biases introduced by minimizing different Sobolev norms as a form of implicit regularization. For the regularized least squares estimator, we find that all considered inductive biases can achieve the optimal convergence rate, provided the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen. The convergence rate is actually independent to the choice of (smooth enough) inductive bias for both ridge and ridgeless regression. Surprisingly, our smoothness requirement recovered the condition found in Bayesian setting and extend the conclusion to the minimum norm interpolation estimators.

Abstract: Machine learning's widespread adoption in decision-making processes raises concerns about fairness, particularly regarding the treatment of sensitive features and potential discrimination against minorities. The software engineering community has responded by developing fairness-oriented metrics, empirical studies, and approaches. However, there remains a gap in understanding and categorizing practices for engineering fairness throughout the machine learning lifecycle. This paper presents a novel catalog of practices for addressing fairness in machine learning derived from a systematic mapping study. The study identifies and categorizes 28 practices from existing literature, mapping them onto different stages of the machine learning lifecycle. From this catalog, the authors extract actionable items and implications for both researchers and practitioners in software engineering. This work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for integrating fairness considerations into the development and deployment of machine learning systems, enhancing their reliability, accountability, and credibility.

Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.

<title>When resampling/reweighting improves feature learning in imbalanced classification?: A toy-model study</title>

arXiv:2409.05598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A toy model of binary classification is studied with the aim of clarifying the class-wise resampling/reweighting effect on the feature learning performance under the presence of class imbalance. In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the input space is taken while keeping the ratio of the dataset size against the input dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property in the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo.

Abstract: We present the first undetectable watermarking scheme for generative image models. Undetectability ensures that no efficient adversary can distinguish between watermarked and un-watermarked images, even after making many adaptive queries. In particular, an undetectable watermark does not degrade image quality under any efficiently computable metric. Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to every prior scheme we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/PRC-Watermark.

arXiv:2410.21635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning an unknown quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H$ from black-box queries to its time evolution $e^{-\mathrm{i} H t}$. Prior proposals for solving this task either impose some assumptions on $H$, such as its interaction structure or locality, or otherwise use an exponential amount of computational postprocessing. In this paper, we present algorithms to learn any $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, which do not need to know the Hamiltonian terms in advance, nor are they restricted to local interactions. Our algorithms are efficient as long as the number of terms $m$ is polynomially bounded in the system size $n$. We consider two models of control over the time evolution:~the first has access to time reversal ($t < 0$), enabling an algorithm that outputs an $\epsilon$-accurate classical description of $H$ after querying its dynamics for a total of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(m/\epsilon)$ evolution time. The second access model is more conventional, allowing only forward-time evolutions;~our algorithm requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\|H\|^3/\epsilon^4)$ evolution time in this setting. Central to our results is the recently introduced concept of a pseudo-Choi state of $H$. We extend the utility of this learning resource by showing how to use it to learn the Fourier spectrum of $H$, how to achieve nearly Heisenberg-limited scaling with it, and how to prepare it even under our more restricted access models.

Abstract: The integration of intelligent and connected technologies in modern vehicles, while offering enhanced functionalities through Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and interfaces like OBD-II and telematics, also exposes the vehicle's in-vehicle network (IVN) to potential cyberattacks. Unlike prior work, we identify a new time-exciting threat model against IVN. These attacks inject malicious messages that exhibit a time-exciting effect, gradually manipulating network traffic to disrupt vehicle operations and compromise safety-critical functions. We systematically analyze the characteristics of the threat: dynamism, time-exciting impact, and low prior knowledge dependency. To validate its practicality, we replicate the attack on a real Advanced Driver Assistance System via Controller Area Network (CAN), exploiting Unified Diagnostic Service vulnerabilities and proposing four attack strategies. While CAN's integrity checks mitigate attacks, Ethernet migration (e.g., DoIP/SOME/IP) introduces new surfaces. We further investigate the feasibility of time-exciting threat under SOME/IP. To detect time-exciting threat, we introduce MDHP-Net, leveraging Multi-Dimentional Hawkes Process (MDHP) and temporal and message-wise feature extracting structures. Meanwhile, to estimate MDHP parameters, we developed the first GPU-optimized gradient descent solver for MDHP (MDHP-GDS). These modules significantly improves the detection rate under time-exciting attacks in multi-ECU IVN system. To address data scarcity, we release STEIA9, the first open-source dataset for time-exciting attacks, covering 9 Ethernet-based attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on STEIA9 (9 attack scenarios) show MDHP-Net outperforms 3 baselines, confirming attack feasibility and detection efficacy.

Abstract: Multi-Source Domain Generalization (DG) is the task of training on multiple source domains and achieving high classification performance on unseen target domains. Recent methods combine robust features from web-scale pretrained backbones with new features learned from source data, and this has dramatically improved benchmark results. However, it remains unclear if DG finetuning methods are becoming better over time, or if improved benchmark performance is simply an artifact of stronger pre-training. Prior studies have shown that perceptual similarity to pre-training data correlates with zero-shot performance, but we find the effect limited in the DG setting. Instead, we posit that having perceptually similar data in pretraining is not enough; and that it is how well these data were learned that determines performance. This leads us to introduce the Alignment Hypothesis, which states that the final DG performance will be high if and only if alignment of image and class label text embeddings is high. Our experiments confirm the Alignment Hypothesis is true, and we use it as an analysis tool of existing DG methods evaluated on DomainBed datasets by splitting evaluation data into In-pretraining (IP) and Out-of-pretraining (OOP). We show that all evaluated DG methods struggle on DomainBed-OOP, while recent methods excel on DomainBed-IP. Put together, our findings highlight the need for DG methods which can generalize beyond pretraining alignment.

Abstract: Partial-assistance exoskeletons hold significant potential for gait rehabilitation by promoting active participation during (re)learning of normative walking patterns. Typically, the control of interaction torques in partial-assistance exoskeletons relies on a hierarchical control structure. These approaches require extensive calibration due to the complexity of the controller and user-specific parameter tuning, especially for activities like stair or ramp navigation. To address the limitations of hierarchical control in exoskeletons, this work proposes a three-step, data-driven approach: (1) using recent sensor data to probabilistically infer locomotion states (landing step length, landing step height, walking velocity, step clearance, gait phase), (2) allowing therapists to modify these features via a user interface, and (3) using the adjusted locomotion features to predict the desired joint posture and model stiffness in a spring-damper system based on prediction uncertainty. We evaluated the proposed approach with two healthy participants engaging in treadmill walking and stair ascent and descent at varying speeds, with and without external modification of the gait features through a user interface. Results showed a variation in kinematics according to the gait characteristics and a negative interaction power suggesting exoskeleton assistance across the different conditions.

Abstract: Transformers, driven by attention mechanisms, form the foundation of large language models (LLMs). As these models scale up, efficient GPU attention kernels become essential for high-throughput and low-latency inference. Diverse LLM applications demand flexible and high-performance attention solutions. We present FlashInfer: a customizable and efficient attention engine for LLM serving. FlashInfer tackles KV-cache storage heterogeneity using block-sparse format and composable formats to optimize memory access and reduce redundancy. It also offers a customizable attention template, enabling adaptation to various settings through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Additionally, FlashInfer's load-balanced scheduling algorithm adjusts to dynamism of user requests while maintaining compatibility with CUDAGraph which requires static configuration. FlashInfer have been integrated into leading LLM serving frameworks like SGLang, vLLM and MLC-Engine. Comprehensive kernel-level and end-to-end evaluations demonstrate FlashInfer's ability to significantly boost kernel performance across diverse inference scenarios: compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving solutions, FlashInfer achieve 29-69% inter-token-latency reduction compared to compiler backends for LLM serving benchmark, 28-30% latency reduction for long-context inference, and 13-17% speedup for LLM serving with parallel generation.

Abstract: Multistakeholder recommender systems are those that account for the impacts and preferences of multiple groups of individuals, not just the end users receiving recommendations. Due to their complexity, these systems cannot be evaluated strictly by the overall utility of a single stakeholder, as is often the case of more mainstream recommender system applications. In this article, we focus our discussion on the challenges of multistakeholder evaluation of recommender systems. We bring attention to the different aspects involved -- from the range of stakeholders involved (including but not limited to providers and consumers) to the values and specific goals of each relevant stakeholder. We discuss how to move from theoretical principles to practical implementation, providing specific use case examples. Finally, we outline open research directions for the RecSys community to explore. We aim to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners about incorporating these complex and domain-dependent issues of evaluation in the course of designing, developing, and researching applications with multistakeholder aspects.

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamic resource allocation in optical networks has been the focus of intense research activity in recent years, with almost 100 peer-reviewed papers. We present a review of progress in the field, and identify significant gaps in benchmarking practices and reproducibility. To determine the strongest benchmark algorithms, we systematically evaluate several heuristics across diverse network topologies. We find that path count and sort criteria for path selection significantly affect the benchmark performance. We meticulously recreate the problems from five landmark papers and apply the improved benchmarks. Our comparisons demonstrate that simple heuristics consistently match or outperform the published RL solutions, often with an order of magnitude lower blocking probability. Furthermore, we present empirical lower bounds on network blocking using a novel defragmentation-based method, revealing that potential improvements over the benchmark heuristics are limited to 19-36% increased traffic load for the same blocking performance in our examples. We make our simulation framework and results publicly available to promote reproducible research and standardized evaluation https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12594495.

Abstract: The rapid growth of mobile applications has escalated Android malware threats. Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits and obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural complexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs' sequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious intent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical context-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD integrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and construct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze application behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level semantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual consistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations from the first tier. Evaluation in real-world settings demonstrates LAMD's effectiveness over conventional detectors, establishing a feasible basis for LLM-driven malware analysis in dynamic threat landscapes.

Abstract: Parallel corpora play an important role in training machine translation (MT) models, particularly for low-resource languages where high-quality bilingual data is scarce. This review provides a comprehensive overview of available parallel corpora for Indic languages, which span diverse linguistic families, scripts, and regional variations. We categorize these corpora into text-to-text, code-switched, and various categories of multimodal datasets, highlighting their significance in the development of robust multilingual MT systems. Beyond resource enumeration, we critically examine the challenges faced in corpus creation, including linguistic diversity, script variation, data scarcity, and the prevalence of informal textual content.We also discuss and evaluate these corpora in various terms such as alignment quality and domain representativeness. Furthermore, we address open challenges such as data imbalance across Indic languages, the trade-off between quality and quantity, and the impact of noisy, informal, and dialectal data on MT performance. Finally, we outline future directions, including leveraging cross-lingual transfer learning, expanding multilingual datasets, and integrating multimodal resources to enhance translation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive review of parallel corpora specifically tailored for low-resource Indic languages in the context of machine translation.

<title>Harmonia: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Data Placement and Migration in Hybrid Storage Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20507</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.20507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid storage systems (HSS) combine multiple storage devices with diverse characteristics to achieve high performance and capacity at low cost. The performance of an HSS highly depends on the effectiveness of two key policies: (1) the data-placement policy, which determines the best-fit storage device for incoming data, and (2) the data-migration policy, which rearranges stored data across the devices to sustain high HSS performance. Prior works focus on improving only data placement or only data migration in HSS, which leads to relatively low HSS performance. Unfortunately, no prior work tries to optimize both policies together. Our goal is to design a holistic data-management technique that optimizes both data-placement and data-migration policies to fully exploit the potential of an HSS, and thus significantly improve system performance. We demonstrate the need for multiple reinforcement learning (RL) agents to accomplish our goal. We propose Harmonia, a multi-agent RL-based data-management technique that employs two lightweight autonomous RL agents, a data-placement agent and a data-migration agent, which adapt their policies for the current workload and HSS configuration, and coordinate with each other to improve overall HSS performance. We evaluate Harmonia on a real HSS with up to four heterogeneous and diverse storage devices. Our evaluation using 17 data-intensive workloads on performance-optimized (cost-optimized) HSS with two storage devices shows that, on average, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior approach by 49.5% (31.7%). On an HSS with three (four) devices, Harmonia outperforms the best-performing prior work by 37.0% (42.0%). Harmonia's performance benefits come with low latency (240ns for inference) and storage overheads (206 KiB in DRAM for both RL agents together). We will open-source Harmonia's implementation to aid future research on HSS.

arXiv:2504.07481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from remote sensing data is pivotal for analyzing climate processes and surface energy budgets. However, LST retrieval is an ill-posed inverse problem, which becomes particularly severe when only a single band is available. In this paper, we propose a deeply coupled framework integrating mechanistic modeling and machine learning to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of single-channel LST retrieval. Training samples are generated using a physically-based radiative transfer model and a global collection of 5810 atmospheric profiles. A physics-informed machine learning framework is proposed to systematically incorporate the first principles from classical physical inversion models into the learning workflow, with optimization constrained by radiative transfer equations. Global validation demonstrated a 30% reduction in root-mean-square error versus standalone methods. Under extreme humidity, the mean absolute error decreased from 4.87 K to 2.29 K (53% improvement). Continental-scale tests across five continents confirmed the superior generalizability of this model.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a fundamental task in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which aims to model the dynamic knowledge states of students based on their interaction histories. However, existing KT models often rely on a global forgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that students' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent interactions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/ringotc/RouterKT.git.

<title>Bayesian Cross-Modal Alignment Learning for Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>

arXiv:2504.09448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large pre-trained models showed promising results in few-shot learning. However, their generalization ability on two-dimensional Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data, i.e., correlation shift and diversity shift, has not been thoroughly investigated. Researches have shown that even with a significant amount of training data, few methods can achieve better performance than the standard empirical risk minimization method (ERM) in OoD generalization. This few-shot OoD generalization dilemma emerges as a challenging direction in deep neural network generalization research, where the performance suffers from overfitting on few-shot examples and OoD generalization errors. In this paper, leveraging a broader supervision source, we explore a novel Bayesian cross-modal image-text alignment learning method (Bayes-CAL) to address this issue. Specifically, the model is designed as only text representations are fine-tuned via a Bayesian modelling approach with gradient orthogonalization loss and invariant risk minimization (IRM) loss. The Bayesian approach is essentially introduced to avoid overfitting the base classes observed during training and improve generalization to broader unseen classes. The dedicated loss is introduced to achieve better image-text alignment by disentangling the causal and non-casual parts of image features. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Bayes-CAL achieved state-of-the-art OoD generalization performances on two-dimensional distribution shifts. Moreover, compared with CLIP-like models, Bayes-CAL yields more stable generalization performances on unseen classes. Our code is available at https://github.com/LinLLLL/BayesCAL.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a physics-informed training framework for projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs) by incorporating a FEM-based, discrete residual loss. The proposed method bridges the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by using FEM residuals to guide the learning process. Key contributions include a parameter-agnostic residual loss for non-linear problems, an architectural modification to improve accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and an empirical study on the proposed physics-informed training process. The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, showcasing improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy. This work emphasizes the importance of FEM residuals in ROM construction and suggests further exploration of alternate architectures. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a physics-informed training framework for projection-based Reduced Order Models (ROMs). We extend the PROM-ANN architecture by complementing snapshot-based training with a FEM-based, discrete physics-informed residual loss, bridging the gap between traditional projection-based ROMs and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Unlike conventional PINNs that rely on analytical PDEs, our approach leverages FEM residuals to guide the learning of the ROM approximation manifold. Key contributions include: (1) a parameter-agnostic, discrete residual loss applicable to non-linear problems, (2) an architectural modification to PROM-ANN improving accuracy for fast-decaying singular values, and (3) an empirical study on the proposed physics informed training process for ROMs.
  The method is demonstrated on a non-linear hyperelasticity problem, simulating a rubber cantilever under multi-axial loads. The main accomplishment in regards to the proposed residual-based loss is its applicability on non-linear problems by interfacing with FEM software while maintaining reasonable training times. The modified PROM-ANN outperforms POD by orders of magnitude in snapshot reconstruction accuracy, while the original formulation is not able to learn a proper mapping for this use-case. Finally, the application of physics informed training in ANN-PROM modestly narrows the gap between data reconstruction and ROM accuracy, however it highlights the untapped potential of the proposed residual-driven optimization for future ROM development. This work underscores the critical role of FEM residuals in ROM construction and calls for further exploration on architectures beyond PROM-ANN.

Summary:<br />
The study explores the challenges of compressing large language models through quantization methods, focusing on the ApiQ method. Attempting to improve upon ApiQ's performance in ultra-low-bit quantization, the researchers investigate combining quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training but find limited benefits. This highlights the importance of full retraining in achieving significant accuracy preservation in quantization. Building on these insights, a novel approach is proposed that incorporates a saliency-aware regularization term to prioritize preserving impactful parameters during quantization. Experiments on benchmark language models demonstrate that this approach enhances accuracy and reduces the gap between quantized and full-precision models with minimal overhead. The method will be released publicly to support future advancements in ultra-low-bit quantization of large language models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models offer remarkable capabilities, but their size and computational demands pose practical challenges. Quantization methods compress their size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Post-training quantization reduces model size efficiently at the cost of decreased accuracy, while quantization-aware training better preserves accuracy but is resource-intensive. Among existing post-training quantization algorithms, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining may not be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain seems to depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. It relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on benchmark language models from the LLaMA family show that our proposed approach boosts accuracy and tightens the gap between the quantized model and the full-precision model, with minimal overhead. Our method will be made publicly available to facilitate future developments in ultra-low-bit quantization of large language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, particularly when enhanced through Reinforcement Learning (RL). While prior work has successfully applied RL to mathematical reasoning -- where rules and correctness are well-defined -- generalizing these methods to broader reasoning domains remains challenging due to limited data, the lack of verifiable reward structures, and diverse task requirements. In this work, we propose NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK, a framework that systematically incorporates multi-domain corpora, including both synthetic and real-world question-answer pairs, into RL training to improve generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK addresses key challenges by (1) incorporating data from varied sources spanning STEM, humanities, social sciences, etc.; (2) applying structured templates (e.g., multiple-choice and open-ended) to control answer-space complexity; (3) filtering for verifiable answers; and (4) optimizing data blending strategies that utilizes data from multiple sources effectively. Our approach enables scalable and verifiable reward modeling beyond mathematics and demonstrates improved accuracies on both math (MATH-500: +30.1%, AMC23:+27.5%) and non-math reasoning benchmarks (MMLU-PRO: +12.8%, GPQA-DIAMOND: +11.3%, AGIEVAL: +15.1%, SUPERGPQA: +3.8%). Moreover, NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK exhibits significantly improved response efficiency -- using 28% fewer tokens for correct answers -- highlighting more focused and effective reasoning. Through NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK, we demonstrate that integrating multi-domain, multi-format data in RL leads to more accurate, efficient, and generalizable LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has significantly propelled applications in document understanding, particularly in optical character recognition (OCR) and multilingual translation. However, current evaluations of LVLMs, like the widely used OCRBench, mainly focus on verifying the correctness of their short-text responses and long-text responses with simple layout, while the evaluation of their ability to understand long texts with complex layout design is highly significant but largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose Menu OCR and Translation Benchmark (MOTBench), a specialized evaluation framework emphasizing the pivotal role of menu translation in cross-cultural communication. MOTBench requires LVLMs to accurately recognize and translate each dish, along with its price and unit items on a menu, providing a comprehensive assessment of their visual understanding and language processing capabilities. Our benchmark is comprised of a collection of Chinese and English menus, characterized by intricate layouts, a variety of fonts, and culturally specific elements across different languages, along with precise human annotations. Experiments show that our automatic evaluation results are highly consistent with professional human evaluation. We evaluate a range of publicly available state-of-the-art LVLMs, and through analyzing their output to identify the strengths and weaknesses in their performance, offering valuable insights to guide future advancements in LVLM development. MOTBench is available at https://github.com/gitwzl/MOTBench.

<div> Walsh decomposition, Gray-box optimization, Variable Interaction Graph, Noise-like dependencies, Optimization effectiveness <br />
<br />Summary: <br />
Gray-box optimization uses Walsh decomposition to identify non-linear variable dependencies for proposing masks that improve variation operator effectiveness. However, in problems where all variables are non-linearly dependent due to noise-like origins, these masks become ineffective. To address this, a weighted dynamic Variable Interaction Graph (wdVIG) is proposed to measure variable dependency strength and filter out irrelevant noise-caused dependencies. This allows for the use of dependency-based masks in optimization processes. The study validates the efficacy of wdVIG on various benchmark problems, showing improved optimization performance in the presence of noise-caused dependencies. For problems without noise, the influence of wdVIG masks is comparable to existing structures. This approach enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of variation operators in optimizing non-linearly dependent variables. <div>

Abstract: Gray-box optimization employs Walsh decomposition to obtain non-linear variable dependencies and utilize them to propose masks of variables that have a joint non-linear influence on fitness value. These masks significantly improve the effectiveness of variation operators. In some problems, all variables are non-linearly dependent, making the aforementioned masks useless. We analyze the features of the real-world instances of such problems and show that many of their dependencies may have noise-like origins. Such noise-caused dependencies are irrelevant to the optimization process and can be ignored. To identify them, we propose extending the use of Walsh decomposition by measuring variable dependency strength that allows the construction of the weighted dynamic Variable Interaction Graph (wdVIG). wdVIGs adjust the dependency strength to mixed individuals. They allow the filtering of irrelevant dependencies and re-enable using dependency-based masks by variation operators. We verify the wdVIG potential on a large benchmark suite. For problems with noise, the wdVIG masks can improve the optimizer's effectiveness. If all dependencies are relevant for the optimization, i.e., the problem is not noised, the influence of wdVIG masks is similar to that of state-of-the-art structures of this kind.

Summary: <br />
This paper explores optimal data selection strategies for Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) training in the medical domain. The study investigates four data sampling strategies from MedQA-USMLE and evaluates their performance across multiple benchmarks. Models trained on filtered data, especially those filtered using larger models, generally outperform those trained on randomly selected samples. However, training on self-filtered samples with a specific model showed superior performance in medical domains but reduced robustness across different benchmarks. Implementing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) further enhances the effectiveness of the selected data. These findings provide valuable insights into effective data organization strategies for RLVR in specialized domains and emphasize the importance of thoughtful data selection in achieving optimal performance.

Abstract: This paper explores optimal data selection strategies for Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) training in the medical domain. While RLVR has shown exceptional potential for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, most prior implementations have focused on mathematics and logical puzzles, with limited exploration of domain-specific applications like medicine. We investigate four distinct data sampling strategies from MedQA-USMLE: random sampling (baseline), and filtering using Phi-4, Gemma-3-27b-it, and Gemma-3-12b-it models. Using Gemma-3-12b-it as our base model and implementing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we evaluate performance across multiple benchmarks including MMLU, GSM8K, MMLU-Pro, and CMMLU. Our findings demonstrate that models trained on filtered data generally outperform those trained on randomly selected samples. Notably, training on self-filtered samples (using Gemma-3-12b-it for filtering) achieved superior performance in medical domains but showed reduced robustness across different benchmarks, while filtering with larger models from the same series yielded better overall robustness. These results provide valuable insights into effective data organization strategies for RLVR in specialized domains and highlight the importance of thoughtful data selection in achieving optimal performance.

<br />Summary: 
This study explores the continuous time dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with nonlinear activation functions, aiming to identify conditions for perpetual oscillatory behavior without converging to fixed points. Skew-symmetric weight matrices are crucial for stable limit cycles in linear and nonlinear configurations. Hyperbolic tangent-like activation functions maintain oscillatory dynamics by preserving motion invariants in state space. Nonlinear activation functions improve numerical stability in system integration, reducing instabilities.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the continuous time dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), focusing on systems with nonlinear activation functions. The objective of this work is to identify conditions under which RNNs exhibit perpetual oscillatory behavior, without converging to static fixed points. We establish that skew-symmetric weight matrices are fundamental to enable stable limit cycles in both linear and nonlinear configurations. We further demonstrate that hyperbolic tangent-like activation functions (odd, bounded, and continuous) preserve these oscillatory dynamics by ensuring motion invariants in state space. Numerical simulations showcase how nonlinear activation functions not only maintain limit cycles, but also enhance the numerical stability of the system integration process, mitigating those instabilities that are commonly associated with the forward Euler method. The experimental results of this analysis highlight practical considerations for designing neural architectures capable of capturing complex temporal dependencies, i.e., strategies for enhancing memorization skills in recurrent models.

Summary:
The study aims to investigate battery degradation in electric vehicles and energy storage systems, focusing on two types of lithium-ion batteries: LiNiCoAlO2 and LiFePO4. A battery degradation model is developed that considers different charge and discharge rates to evaluate internal cell health and performance under various loading conditions. The model incorporates the Extended Kalman Filter, Convolutional Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory networks to validate experimental data with high accuracy. The peak identification technique is used to analyze battery health based on peak characteristics, revealing that LiFePO4 batteries exhibit more consistent performance than LiNiCoAlO2 cells. The study finds that cell aging occurs gradually under normal loading rates but deteriorates rapidly under fast loading conditions. Overall, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in analyzing battery degradation mechanisms and performance under different loading conditions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery degradation is a major challenge in electric vehicles (EV) and energy storage systems (ESS). However, most degradation investigations focus mainly on estimating the state of charge (SOC), which fails to accurately interpret the cells' internal degradation mechanisms. Differential capacity analysis (DCA) focuses on the rate of change of cell voltage about the change in cell capacity, under various charge/discharge rates. This paper developed a battery cell degradation testing model that used two types of lithium-ions (Li-ion) battery cells, namely lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (LiNiCoAlO2) and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), to evaluate internal degradation during loading conditions. The proposed battery degradation model contains distinct charge rates (DCR) of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 1.5C, as well as discharge rates (DDR) of 0.5C, 0.9C, 1.3C, and 1.6C to analyze the internal health and performance of battery cells during slow, moderate, and fast loading conditions. Besides, this research proposed a model that incorporates the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to validate experimental data. The proposed model yields excellent modelling results based on mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), with errors of less than 0.001% at DCR and DDR. The peak identification technique (PIM) has been utilized to investigate battery health based on the number of peaks, peak position, peak height, peak area, and peak width. At last, the PIM method has discovered that the cell aged gradually under normal loading rates but deteriorated rapidly under fast loading conditions. Overall, LiFePO4 batteries perform more robustly and consistently than (LiNiCoAlO2) cells under varying loading conditions.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) often undergo supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to acquire tool use capabilities. However, SFT struggles to generalize to unfamiliar or complex tool use scenarios. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with R1-like models, have demonstrated promising reasoning and generalization abilities. Yet, reward design for tool use presents unique challenges: multiple tools may be invoked with diverse parameters, and coarse-grained reward signals, such as answer matching, fail to offer the finegrained feedback required for effective learning. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on reward design for tool selection and application tasks within the RL paradigm. We systematically explore a wide range of reward strategies, analyzing their types, scales, granularity, and temporal dynamics. Building on these insights, we propose a principled reward design tailored for tool use tasks and apply it to train LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields robust, scalable, and stable training, achieving a 17% improvement over base models and a 15% gain over SFT models. These results highlight the critical role of thoughtful reward design in enhancing the tool use capabilities and generalization performance of LLMs. All the codes are released to facilitate future research.

<div> Keywords: traffic demand prediction, confidence intervals, interval adaptation, coverage level, real-world datasets

Summary: <br /><br />Accurate short-term traffic demand prediction is crucial for traffic system operation. Existing methods for predicting confidence intervals often make strict assumptions, leading to potentially invalid intervals in a changing traffic environment. To address this, the CONTINA method is proposed, providing adaptable interval predictions. This method adjusts intervals based on deployment errors, ensuring coverage convergence to target levels. Experimental results with real-world datasets and prediction models show that CONTINA generates valid, shorter confidence intervals. By offering reliable interval predictions, CONTINA can assist traffic management personnel in developing more rational and robust operation plans. The code, model, and dataset are also made available on GitHub for further research and application. <div>
arXiv:2504.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate short-term traffic demand prediction is critical for the operation of traffic systems. Besides point estimation, the confidence interval of the prediction is also of great importance. Many models for traffic operations, such as shared bike rebalancing and taxi dispatching, take into account the uncertainty of future demand and require confidence intervals as the input. However, existing methods for confidence interval modeling rely on strict assumptions, such as unchanging traffic patterns and correct model specifications, to guarantee enough coverage. Therefore, the confidence intervals provided could be invalid, especially in a changing traffic environment. To fill this gap, we propose an efficient method, CONTINA (Conformal Traffic Intervals with Adaptation) to provide interval predictions that can adapt to external changes. By collecting the errors of interval during deployment, the method can adjust the interval in the next step by widening it if the errors are too large or shortening it otherwise. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the coverage of the confidence intervals provided by our method converges to the target coverage level. Experiments across four real-world datasets and prediction models demonstrate that the proposed method can provide valid confidence intervals with shorter lengths. Our method can help traffic management personnel develop a more reasonable and robust operation plan in practice. And we release the code, model and dataset in \href{ https://github.com/xiannanhuang/CONTINA/}{ Github}.

Summary: <br />
This study addresses the challenge of ensuring stochastic-like guarantees in sequential learning from i.i.d. data streams containing unknown clean-label adversarial samples. Learners are allowed to abstain from making predictions when uncertain, with regrets measured in misclassification and abstention error. Building on prior work, the researchers correct inaccuracies and extend the approach to the agnostic setting, where labels are random. They introduce the concept of a clean-label adversary in this context and provide the first theoretical analysis of a disagreement-based learner for thresholds in the presence of a clean-label adversary with noise. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the challenge of establishing stochastic-like guarantees when sequentially learning from a stream of i.i.d. data that includes an unknown quantity of clean-label adversarial samples. We permit the learner to abstain from making predictions when uncertain. The regret of the learner is measured in terms of misclassification and abstention error, where we allow the learner to abstain for free on adversarial injected samples. This approach is based on the work of Goel, Hanneke, Moran, and Shetty from arXiv:2306.13119. We explore the methods they present and manage to correct inaccuracies in their argumentation.
  However, this approach is limited to the realizable setting, where labels are assigned according to some function $f^*$ from the hypothesis space $\mathcal{F}$. Based on similar arguments, we explore methods to make adaptations for the agnostic setting where labels are random. Introducing the notion of a clean-label adversary in the agnostic context, we are the first to give a theoretical analysis of a disagreement-based learner for thresholds, subject to a clean-label adversary with noise.

This paper introduces Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) Factorization, a novel neural network operator that enhances efficiency and reduces the number of parameters compared to traditional dense layers. MTS implements tensor summation at multiple scales, achieved through Tucker-decomposition-like mode products. The experimental comparison with MLPs and CNNs shows the effectiveness of MTS networks in classification, compression, and signal restoration tasks. Integration with the multi-head gate (MHG) results in MTSNet, offering a more favorable complexity-performance tradeoff than state-of-the-art transformers in computer vision applications. The software implementation of MTSNet is available on GitHub. The MTS layer proves advantageous over convolutional layers, providing a new backbone neural layer that improves weight optimization efficiency and reduces parameter requirements. <div>
arXiv:2504.13975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLP), or fully connected artificial neural networks, are known for performing vector-matrix multiplications using learnable weight matrices; however, their practical application in many machine learning tasks, especially in computer vision, can be limited due to the high dimensionality of input-output pairs at each layer. To improve efficiency, convolutional operators have been utilized to facilitate weight sharing and local connections, yet they are constrained by limited receptive fields. In this paper, we introduce Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) Factorization, a novel neural network operator that implements tensor summation at multiple scales, where each tensor to be summed is obtained through Tucker-decomposition-like mode products. Unlike other tensor decomposition methods in the literature, MTS is not introduced as a network compression tool; instead, as a new backbone neural layer. MTS not only reduces the number of parameters required while enhancing the efficiency of weight optimization compared to traditional dense layers (i.e., unfactorized weight matrices in MLP layers), but it also demonstrates clear advantages over convolutional layers. The proof-of-concept experimental comparison of the proposed MTS networks with MLPs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrates their effectiveness across various tasks, such as classification, compression, and signal restoration. Additionally, when integrated with modern non-linear units such as the multi-head gate (MHG), also introduced in this study, the corresponding neural network, MTSNet, demonstrates a more favorable complexity-performance tradeoff compared to state-of-the-art transformers in various computer vision applications. The software implementation of the MTS layer and the corresponding MTS-based networks, MTSNets, is shared at https://github.com/mehmetyamac/MTSNet.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to efficiently handling long contexts in transformer-based language models. Drawing inspiration from the cache and virtual memory principles in computers, the proposed design divides long contexts into small segments and retrieves nearby segments in an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the compressed level. The enhancements include short sliding window attention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k high attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment attention to prevent segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an architecture that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, with an average perplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes. <div>

Abstract: Efficiently handling long contexts in transformer-based language models with low perplexity is an active area of research. Numerous recent approaches like Linformer, Longformer, Performer, and Structured state space models (SSMs)., have not fully resolved this problem. All these models strive to reduce the quadratic time complexity of the attention mechanism while minimizing the loss in quality due to the effective compression of the long context. Inspired by the cache and virtual memory principle in computers, where in case of a cache miss, not only the needed data is retrieved from the memory, but the adjacent data is also obtained, we apply this concept to handling long contexts by dividing it into small segments. In our design, we retrieve the nearby segments in an uncompressed form when high segment-level attention occurs at the compressed level. Our en-hancements for handling long context include aggregating four attention mechanisms consisting of short sliding window attention, long compressed segmented attention, dynamically retrieving top k high attention uncompressed segments, and overlapping segments in long segment attention to avoid segment fragmentation. These enhancements result in an architecture that outperforms ex-isting SOTA architectures with an average perplexity improvement of 8.5% over similar model sizes.

Abstract: Driven by applications in telecommunication networks, we explore the simulation task of estimating rare event probabilities for tandem queues in their steady state.

To mitigate this, we introduce a new importance sampling approach that utilizes a marginal likelihood ratio on the stationary distribution, effectively avoiding the issue of excessive variance. In addition, we design a machine learning algorithm to estimate this marginal likelihood ratio using importance sampling data. Numerical experiments indicate that our algorithm outperforms the classic importance sampling methods.

Summary:  
This research explores the use of parameter-efficient low-rank early-exit casting in large language models to reduce time and computational costs. Existing methods involve maintaining separate early-exit shortcuts for each transformer intermediate block-level during inference. The proposed approach, called One-Jump-Fits-All (OJFA), selects a single low-rank shortcut that drastically reduces shortcut parameter costs by over 30x. Despite this reduction, the OJFA shortcut performs comparably to maintaining multiple shortcuts during inference and ensures stable precision across all transformer block-levels for models like GPT2-XL, Phi3-Mini, and Llama2-7B. By offering a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining model performance, this approach shows promise for enhancing the efficiency of large language models during inference.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce the time and computational costs of inference of large language models, there has been interest in parameter-efficient low-rank early-exit casting of transformer hidden-representations to final-representations. Such low-rank short-cutting has been shown to outperform identity shortcuts at early model stages while offering parameter-efficiency in shortcut jumps. However, current low-rank methods maintain a separate early-exit shortcut jump to final-representations for each transformer intermediate block-level during inference. In this work, we propose selection of a single One-Jump-Fits-All (OJFA) low-rank shortcut that offers over a 30x reduction in shortcut parameter costs during inference. We show that despite this extreme reduction, our OJFA choice largely matches the performance of maintaining multiple shortcut jumps during inference and offers stable precision from all transformer block-levels for GPT2-XL, Phi3-Mini and Llama2-7B transformer models.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to their size. Quantization is a common method to reduce memory usage and inference time, but LLMs have unique challenges with outliers in their activations. This study explores the use of Hadamard matrices over random rotation matrices for quantization in LLMs. Hadamard matrices prove more effective in reducing outliers, enabling 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches. The gradual binary search method used results in a 40% increase in accuracy on benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. Rotation matrices, supported by the Paley algorithm, extend the method to non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions. Theoretical analysis supports the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers, with experimental results showing enhanced model performance and outperformance of existing methods. This approach enables practical 3-bit quantization for various model families. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal in artificial intelligence, demonstrating strong capabilities in reasoning, understanding, and generating data. However, their deployment on edge devices is hindered by their substantial size, often reaching several billion parameters. Quantization is a widely used method to reduce memory usage and inference time, however LLMs present unique challenges due to the prevalence of outliers in their activations. In this work, we leverage the theoretical advantages of Hadamard matrices over random rotation matrices to push the boundaries of quantization in LLMs. We demonstrate that Hadamard matrices are more effective in reducing outliers, which are a significant obstacle in achieving low-bit quantization. Our method based on a gradual binary search enables 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and key-value (KV) caches, resulting in a 40\% increase in accuracy on common benchmarks compared to SoTA methods. We extend the use of rotation matrices to support non-power-of-2 embedding dimensions, similar to the Qwen architecture, by employing the Paley algorithm. We theoretically demonstrates the superiority of Hadamard matrices in reducing outliers.We achieved 3-bit quantization for weights, activations, and KV cache, significantly enhancing model performance. Our experimental results on multiple models family like Mistral, LLaMA, and Qwen demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods and enabling practical 3-bit quantization.

<div> Permutation-invariant deep neural network, GNSS, urban environments, non-Gaussian error, positioning accuracy
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach, PC-DeepNet, for improving Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) localization in urban and sub-urban areas with challenging conditions like non-line-of-sight propagation and multipath effects. Traditional model-based methods struggle in such environments due to non-Gaussian error distributions. PC-DeepNet utilizes a permutation-invariant deep neural network to estimate position corrections, enhancing accuracy by incorporating NLOS and multipath indicators as features. Performance comparison with existing methods using publicly available datasets demonstrates that PC-DeepNet achieves superior accuracy and lower computational complexity. This novel approach addresses the limitations of conventional techniques and offers a promising solution for precise localization in GNSS systems operating in challenging urban settings.

Abstract: Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) face significant challenges in urban and sub-urban areas due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and low received power levels, resulting in highly non-linear and non-Gaussian measurement error distributions. In light of this, conventional model-based positioning approaches, which rely on Gaussian error approximations, struggle to achieve precise localization under these conditions. To overcome these challenges, we put forth a novel learning-based framework, PC-DeepNet, that employs a permutation-invariant (PI) deep neural network (DNN) to estimate position corrections (PC). This approach is designed to ensure robustness against changes in the number and/or order of visible satellite measurements, a common issue in GNSS systems, while leveraging NLOS and multipath indicators as features to enhance positioning accuracy in challenging urban and sub-urban environments. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we compare the positioning error with state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based positioning methods using two publicly available datasets. The results confirm that proposed PC-DeepNet achieves superior accuracy than existing model-based and learning-based methods while exhibiting lower computational complexity compared to previous learning-based approaches.

Summary:
Mobile networks rely on strategically positioned radio nodes to provide connectivity services. The mobile network topology, defining the relations between these nodes, is crucial for networking infrastructure. Traditional methods for establishing mobility relations encounter limitations as they can only be set before physical hardware installation. This study introduces graph-based deep learning techniques to determine mobility relations using radio node configuration data and Automatic Neighbor Relations (ANR) in stable networks. Two deep learning models, graph neural network (GNN) and multilayer perceptron, were evaluated on Telecom datasets, showing the effectiveness of GNNs. Incorporating graph structure improved results, highlighting the potential of GNNs. The study also explored the use of heuristics based on radio node distance to enhance precision and accuracy, leading to considerable improvements in the results. <div>

Abstract: Mobile networks consist of interconnected radio nodes strategically positioned across various geographical regions to provide connectivity services. The set of relations between these radio nodes, referred to as the \emph{mobile network topology}, is vital in the construction of the networking infrastructure. Typically, the connections between radio nodes and their associated cells are defined by software features that establish mobility relations (referred to as \emph{edges} in this paper) within the mobile network graph through heuristic methods. Although these approaches are efficient, they encounter significant limitations, particularly since edges can only be established prior to the installation of physical hardware.
  In this work, we use graph-based deep learning methods to determine mobility relations (edges), trained on radio node configuration data and reliable mobility relations set by Automatic Neighbor Relations (ANR) in stable networks. This paper focuses on measuring the accuracy and precision of different graph-based deep learning approaches applied to real-world mobile networks. We evaluated two deep learning models. Our comprehensive experiments on Telecom datasets obtained from operational Telecom Networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the graph neural network (GNN) model and multilayer perceptron. Our evaluation showed that considering graph structure improves results, which motivates the use of GNNs. Additionally, we investigated the use of heuristics to reduce the training time based on the distance between radio nodes to eliminate irrelevant cases. Our investigation showed that the use of these heuristics improved precision and accuracy considerably.

Summary: 
The article discusses the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods in optimization problems, particularly focusing on momentum-based SGD methods. These modifications have been observed to yield better results in certain cases, although empirical evidence is primarily relied upon rather than rigorous proof. The dynamics of gradient descent methods are typically studied through continuous approximations, but existing works have only covered scenarios with constant learning rates or SGD without momentum terms. The article presents approximation results for SGD under weak assumptions, allowing for the variation of learning rates and momentum parameters over time. This research contributes to a better understanding of the behavior of SGD methods in optimization problems with varying parameters. <div>

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) methods see many uses in optimization problems. Modifications to the algorithm, such as momentum-based SGD methods have been known to produce better results in certain cases. Much of this, however, is due to empirical information rather than rigorous proof. While the dynamics of gradient descent methods can be studied through continuous approximations, existing works only cover scenarios with constant learning rates or SGD without momentum terms. We present approximation results under weak assumptions for SGD that allow learning rates and momentum parameters to vary with respect to time.

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge faced by domain experts who lack the time or training to create formal Bayesian models. It proposes a method that combines a large language model and a probabilistic programming language to generate a joint distribution over formal models, latent variables, and data based on an informal problem description. The approach involves creating many formal models from the language model, conducting approximate inference on each model, and then combining the results through a weighted average. This process is a combination of self-normalized importance sampling, MCMC, and variational inference. The resulting posterior over latent variables provides sensible predictions without the need for specifying a formal model. <div>

Abstract: Many domain experts do not have the time or training to write formal Bayesian models. This paper takes an informal problem description as input, and combines a large language model and a probabilistic programming language to create a joint distribution over formal models, latent variables, and data. A posterior over latent variables follows by conditioning on observed data and integrating over formal models. This presents a challenging inference problem. We suggest an inference recipe that amounts to generating many formal models from the large language model, performing approximate inference on each, and then doing a weighted average. This is justified an analyzed as a combination of self-normalized importance sampling, MCMC, and variational inference. We show that this produces sensible predictions without the need to specify a formal model.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new method called CAOTE for token eviction in large language models. The traditional token eviction approach relies on attention scores, which may not accurately reflect the importance of tokens. CAOTE incorporates both attention scores and value vectors to improve the accuracy of token eviction. By considering the contribution of tokens to attention outputs, CAOTE effectively optimizes for eviction error and enhances the performance of existing methods. The proposed method can be used in conjunction with other token eviction techniques and consistently improves accuracies on downstream tasks. This innovative approach highlights the significance of leveraging value vector information during the token eviction process.<br /><br />Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2504.14051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

Abstract: Understanding patient feedback is crucial for improving healthcare services, yet analyzing unlabeled short-text feedback presents significant challenges due to limited data and domain-specific nuances. Traditional supervised learning approaches require extensive labeled datasets, making unsupervised methods more viable for uncovering meaningful insights from patient feedback. This study explores unsupervised methods to extract meaningful topics from 439 survey responses collected from a healthcare system in Wisconsin, USA. A keyword-based filtering approach was applied to isolate complaint-related feedback using a domain-specific lexicon. To delve deeper and analyze dominant topics in feedback, we explored traditional topic modeling methods, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (GSDMM), alongside BERTopic, an advanced neural embedding-based clustering approach. To improve coherence and interpretability where data are scarce and consist of short-texts, we propose kBERT, an integration of BERT embeddings with k-means clustering. Model performance was assessed using coherence scores (Cv ) for topic interpretability and average Inverted Rank-Biased Overlap (IRBOavg) for topic diversity. Results indicate that kBERT achieves the highest coherence (Cv = 0.53) and distinct topic separation (IRBOavg = 1.00), outperforming all other models in short-text healthcare feedback analysis. Our findings emphasize the importance of embedding-based techniques for topic identification and highlight the need for context-aware models in healthcare analytics.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models aim to improve interpretability by predicting high-level intermediate concepts, representing a promising approach for deployment in high-risk scenarios. However, they are known to suffer from information leakage, whereby models exploit unintended information encoded within the learned concepts. We introduce an information-theoretic framework to rigorously characterise and quantify leakage, and define two complementary measures: the concepts-task leakage (CTL) and interconcept leakage (ICL) scores. We show that these measures are strongly predictive of model behaviour under interventions and outperform existing alternatives in robustness and reliability. Using this framework, we identify the primary causes of leakage and provide strong evidence that Concept Embedding Models exhibit substantial leakage regardless of the hyperparameters choice. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for designing concept-based models to reduce leakage and ensure interpretability.

Abstract: Personalized therapy, in which a therapeutic practice is adapted to an individual patient, can lead to improved health outcomes. Typically, this is accomplished by relying on a therapist's training and intuition along with feedback from a patient. However, this requires the therapist to become an expert on any technological components, such as in the case of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET). While there exist approaches to automatically adapt therapeutic content to a patient, they generally rely on hand-authored, pre-defined rules, which may not generalize to all individuals. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically adapt therapeutic content to patients based on physiological measures. We implement our approach in the context of virtual reality arachnophobia exposure therapy, and rely on experience-driven procedural content generation via reinforcement learning (EDPCGRL) to generate virtual spiders to match an individual patient. Through a human subject study, we demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms a more common rules-based method, highlighting its potential for enhancing personalized therapeutic interventions.

This paper introduces an AI-driven approach to improve math learning within a modern Learning Management System (LMS) by recommending similar math questions. Deep embeddings for math questions are created using Meta's Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model. Three recommendation methods are utilized: cosine similarity, Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Evaluation of these methods using user interaction data such as session durations, response times, and correctness shows that cosine similarity offers nearly identical matches, SOM leads to higher user satisfaction, and GMM generally underperforms. It is suggested that introducing variety in question recommendations can enhance engagement and potential learning outcomes up to a certain point. The data from the implementations of all three methods support this assertion. <div>

Abstract: Carbon fiber-reinforced composites (CFRC) are pivotal in advanced engineering applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties. A deep understanding of CFRC behavior under mechanical loading is essential for optimizing performance in demanding applications such as aerospace structures. While traditional Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, including advanced techniques like Interface-enriched Generalized FEM (IGFEM), offer valuable insights, they can struggle with computational efficiency. Existing data-driven surrogate models partially address these challenges by predicting propagated damage or stress-strain behavior but fail to comprehensively capture the evolution of stress and damage throughout the entire deformation history, including crack initiation and propagation. This study proposes a novel auto-regressive composite U-Net deep learning model to simultaneously predict stress and damage fields during CFRC deformation. By leveraging the U-Net architecture's ability to capture spatial features and integrate macro- and micro-scale phenomena, the proposed model overcomes key limitations of prior approaches. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting evolution of stress and damage distribution within the microstructure of a CFRC under unidirectional strain, offering a speed-up of over 60 times compared to IGFEM.

Abstract: With the rapid development of machine learning in recent years, many problems in meteorology can now be addressed using AI models. In particular, data-driven algorithms have significantly improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. Meteorological data is often transformed into 2D images or 3D videos, which are then fed into AI models for learning. Additionally, these models often incorporate physical signals, such as temperature, pressure, and wind speed, to further enhance accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we review several representative AI + Weather/Climate algorithms and propose a new paradigm where observational data from different perspectives, each with distinct physical meanings, are treated as multimodal data and integrated via transformers. Furthermore, key weather and climate knowledge can be incorporated through regularization techniques to further strengthen the model's capabilities. This new paradigm is versatile and can address a variety of tasks, offering strong generalizability. We also discuss future directions for improving model accuracy and interpretability.

Summary: <br />
Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm for decentralized graph-structured data while preserving local privacy. It includes Server-Client (S-C) and Client-Client (C-C) paradigms. The C-C architecture allows direct client-client communication for personalized training. However, existing C-C methods transmit redundant node embeddings, leading to high communication costs. To address this, FedC4 combines graph Condensation with Client-Client Collaboration, distilling private graphs into compact synthetic embeddings. It includes modules tailored to target clients' graph structures for personalized optimization and global guidance. Extensive experiments show that FedC4 outperforms existing methods in performance and communication efficiency.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative model training over decentralized graph-structured data while preserving local privacy. Existing FGL methods can be categorized into two optimization architectures: (1) the Server-Client (S-C) paradigm, where clients upload local models for server-side aggregation; and (2) the Client-Client (C-C) paradigm, which allows direct information exchange among clients to support personalized training. Compared to S-C, the C-C architecture better captures global graph knowledge and enables fine-grained optimization through customized peer-to-peer communication. However, current C-C methods often broadcast identical and redundant node embeddings, incurring high communication costs and privacy risks. To address this, we propose FedC4, a novel framework that combines graph Condensation with Client-Client Collaboration. Instead of transmitting raw node-level features, FedC4 distills each client's private graph into a compact set of synthetic node embeddings, reducing communication overhead and enhancing privacy. In addition, FedC4 introduces three modules that allow source clients to send distinct node representations tailored to target clients'graph structures, enabling personalized optimization with global guidance. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show that FedC4 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both performance and communication efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Time series anomaly detection, Unsupervised learning, Transformer-based architecture, Contrastive representation learning, Differential data

Summary:<br /><br />
Time series anomaly detection is crucial for risk identification, but unsupervised learning methods often struggle to capture complex dependencies within time series data. To address this, a novel framework called DConAD is proposed. DConAD leverages differencing-based contrastive representation learning to generate additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies efficiently. It also employs a unique KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to enhance representation learning without relying on prior knowledge. The stop-gradient strategy is implemented to ensure convergence. Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the superiority of DConAD over nine baseline methods. The code for DConAD is available on GitHub for further exploration and use. <div>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.

Summary:
Spatial Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used for fraud detection due to their inductive learning capabilities. Existing methods exclude heterophilic neighbors during message passing, disrupting the graph structure. The Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing (DHMP) framework divides the graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs, mitigating biases and uncertainty in predictions. DHMP uses shared weights to capture signals at different frequencies independently and includes a customized sampling strategy. This allows nodes to balance signal contributions based on labels. Experiments on real-world datasets show DHMP outperforms existing methods by separating signals with different frequencies for better fraud detection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Fraudulent activities have significantly increased across various domains, such as e-commerce, online review platforms, and social networks, making fraud detection a critical task. Spatial Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to fraud detection tasks due to their strong inductive learning capabilities. However, existing spatial GNN-based methods often enhance the graph structure by excluding heterophilic neighbors during message passing to align with the homophilic bias of GNNs. Unfortunately, this approach can disrupt the original graph topology and increase uncertainty in predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework, Dual-channel Heterophilic Message Passing (DHMP), for fraud detection. DHMP leverages a heterophily separation module to divide the graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs, mitigating the low-pass inductive bias of traditional GNNs. It then applies shared weights to capture signals at different frequencies independently and incorporates a customized sampling strategy for training. This allows nodes to adaptively balance the contributions of various signals based on their labels. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DHMP outperforms existing methods, highlighting the importance of separating signals with different frequencies for improved fraud detection.

<div> transformer-based, anomaly detection, time series, decomposition, multivariate

Summary:
TransDe is a transformer-based framework designed for multivariate time series anomaly detection. It addresses the challenges of modeling dependencies in complex sequences and handling noise in time series data. By combining time series decomposition and transformers, TransDe effectively learns diverse patterns in normal time series data. The architecture leverages a multi-scale patch-based approach to capture dependencies of decomposed components and utilizes a contrastive learning paradigm to align representations of normal patterns. An asynchronous loss function with a stop-gradient strategy is introduced to optimize performance efficiently. Experiment results on public datasets demonstrate that TransDe outperforms twelve baselines in terms of F1 score, showcasing its effectiveness in detecting anomalies in time series data.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is crucial for maintaining stable systems. Existing methods face two main challenges. First, it is difficult to directly model the dependencies of diverse and complex patterns within the sequences. Second, many methods that optimize parameters using mean squared error struggle with noise in the time series, leading to performance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based framework built on decomposition (TransDe) for multivariate time series anomaly detection. The key idea is to combine the strengths of time series decomposition and transformers to effectively learn the complex patterns in normal time series data. A multi-scale patch-based transformer architecture is proposed to exploit the representative dependencies of each decomposed component of the time series. Furthermore, a contrastive learn paradigm based on patch operation is proposed, which leverages KL divergence to align the positive pairs, namely the pure representations of normal patterns between different patch-level views. A novel asynchronous loss function with a stop-gradient strategy is further introduced to enhance the performance of TransDe effectively. It can avoid time-consuming and labor-intensive computation costs in the optimization process. Extensive experiments on five public datasets are conducted and TransDe shows superiority compared with twelve baselines in terms of F1 score. Our code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/TransDe.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel thermal prediction network, FSA-Heat, aimed at addressing challenges in thermal management for 2.5D chiplet-based ICs. By integrating a high-to-low frequency and spatial domain encoder module with a frequency domain cross-scale interaction module, FSA-Heat efficiently captures global thermal features. A frequency-spatial hybrid loss is designed to enhance prediction accuracy by reducing noise and spatial misalignments. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, with a substantial reduction in RMSE and a notable increase in inference time speedup. The proposed approach, FSA-Heat, also showcases robust generalization capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2504.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the post-Moore era, 2.5D chiplet-based ICs present significant challenges in thermal management due to increased power density and thermal hotspots. Neural network-based thermal prediction models can perform real-time predictions for many unseen new designs. However, existing CNN-based and GCN-based methods cannot effectively capture the global thermal features, especially for high-frequency components, hindering prediction accuracy enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-spatial dual domain aware prediction network (FSA-Heat) for fast and high-accuracy thermal prediction in 2.5D ICs. It integrates high-to-low frequency and spatial domain encoder (FSTE) module with frequency domain cross-scale interaction module (FCIFormer) to achieve high-to-low frequency and global-to-local thermal dissipation feature extraction. Additionally, a frequency-spatial hybrid loss (FSL) is designed to effectively attenuate high-frequency thermal gradient noise and spatial misalignments. The experimental results show that the performance enhancements offered by our proposed method are substantial, outperforming the newly-proposed 2.5D method, GCN+PNA, by considerable margins (over 99% RMSE reduction, 4.23X inference time speedup). Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that FSA-Heat also exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

<div> Keywords: Graph anomaly detection, graph pre-training, homophily-heterophily mixture, spectral filtering, adaptive fine-tuning

Summary: 
Graph anomaly detection is a challenging task due to the scarcity of abnormal nodes and the high cost of label annotations. Traditional graph pre-training methods assume strong homophily, but anomalies often exhibit high local heterophily. This complex homophily-heterophily mixture requires a more nuanced approach. The study shows that a global low-pass filter is insufficient for GAD and highlights the importance of selectively applying appropriate filters to individual nodes. To address this, the Pre-Training and Adaptive Fine-tuning (PAF) framework is proposed. PAF utilizes joint training with low- and high-pass filters in the pre-training phase to capture frequency information in node features. Additionally, PAF incorporates a gated fusion network during fine-tuning to adaptively combine node representations generated by both filters. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PAF in enhancing graph anomaly detection performance. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has garnered increasing attention in recent years, yet it remains challenging due to the scarcity of abnormal nodes and the high cost of label annotations. Graph pre-training, the two-stage learning paradigm, has emerged as an effective approach for label-efficient learning, largely benefiting from expressive neighborhood aggregation under the assumption of strong homophily. However, in GAD, anomalies typically exhibit high local heterophily, while normal nodes retain strong homophily, resulting in a complex homophily-heterophily mixture. To understand the impact of this mixed pattern on graph pre-training, we analyze it through the lens of spectral filtering and reveal that relying solely on a global low-pass filter is insufficient for GAD. We further provide a theoretical justification for the necessity of selectively applying appropriate filters to individual nodes. Building upon this insight, we propose PAF, a Pre-Training and Adaptive Fine-tuning framework specifically designed for GAD. In particular, we introduce joint training with low- and high-pass filters in the pre-training phase to capture the full spectrum of frequency information in node features. During fine-tuning, we devise a gated fusion network that adaptively combines node representations generated by both filters. Extensive experiments across ten benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of PAF.

Summary: 
The study introduces a new generative framework called Cohesion for emulating nonlinear dynamics, aiming to address long-range skill decay and produce physically realistic outputs. Cohesion utilizes coherent structure estimation of underlying dynamics as guidance during denoising, with small-scale flow fluctuations resolved based on this guidance. The method efficiently approximates the coherent priors using reduced-order models like deep Koopman operators, enabling rapid generation of long prior sequences for extended forecasting. By reframing forecasting as trajectory planning, Cohesion performs conditional denoising over entire sequences, reducing the computational cost associated with autoregressive-based generative approaches. Empirical evaluations on chaotic systems demonstrate Cohesion's superior long-range forecasting capabilities and its ability to generate physically-consistent simulations, even with partially-observed guidance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven emulation of nonlinear dynamics is challenging due to long-range skill decay that often produces physically unrealistic outputs. Recent advances in generative modeling aim to address these issues by providing uncertainty quantification and correction. However, the quality of generated simulation remains heavily dependent on the choice of conditioning priors. In this work, we present an efficient generative framework for dynamics emulation, unifying principles of turbulence with diffusion-based modeling: Cohesion. Specifically, our method estimates large-scale coherent structure of the underlying dynamics as guidance during the denoising process, where small-scale fluctuation in the flow is then resolved. These coherent priors are efficiently approximated using reduced-order models, such as deep Koopman operators, that allow for rapid generation of long prior sequences while maintaining stability over extended forecasting horizon. With this gain, we can reframe forecasting as trajectory planning, a common task in reinforcement learning, where conditional denoising is performed once over entire sequences, minimizing the computational cost of autoregressive-based generative methods. Empirical evaluations on chaotic systems of increasing complexity, including Kolmogorov flow, shallow water equations, and subseasonal-to-seasonal climate dynamics, demonstrate Cohesion superior long-range forecasting skill that can efficiently generate physically-consistent simulations, even in the presence of partially-observed guidance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamically optimizing numerical precision in the preconditioned conjugate gradient (CG) method. By modeling precision selection as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we employ Q-learning to adaptively assign precision levels to key operations, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy, while ensuring stability through double-precision scalar computations and residual computing. In practice, the algorithm is trained on a set of data and subsequently performs inference for precision selection on out-of-sample data, without requiring re-analysis or retraining for new datasets. This enables the method to adapt seamlessly to new problem instances without the computational overhead of recalibration. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in enhancing solver's performance, marking the first application of RL to mixed-precision numerical methods. The findings highlight the approach's practical advantages, robustness, and scalability, providing valuable insights into its integration with iterative solvers and paving the way for AI-driven advancements in scientific computing.

Abstract: Recent advances of reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, highlight the significant potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, replicating these advancements across diverse domains remains challenging due to limited methodological transparency. In this work, we present two-Staged history-Resampling Policy Optimization (SRPO), which successfully surpasses the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B on the AIME24 and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. SRPO achieves this using the same base model as DeepSeek (i.e. Qwen2.5-32B) and relies solely on RL, without prior Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Building upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we introduce two key methodological innovations: (1) a two-stage cross-domain training paradigm designed to balance the development of mathematical reasoning and coding proficiency, and (2) History Resampling (HR), a technique to address ineffective samples. Our comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dedicating to offer valuable insights into scaling LLM reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality residential load data can pose obstacles for decarbonizing the residential sector as well as effective grid planning and operation. The above challenges have motivated research into generating synthetic load data, but existing methods faced limitations in terms of scalability, diversity, and similarity. This paper proposes a Generative Adversarial Network-based Synthetic Residential Load Pattern (RLP-GAN) generation model, a novel weakly-supervised GAN framework, leveraging an over-complete autoencoder to capture dependencies within complex and diverse load patterns and learn household-level data distribution at scale. We incorporate a model weight selection method to address the mode collapse problem and generate load patterns with high diversity. We develop a holistic evaluation method to validate the effectiveness of RLP-GAN using real-world data of 417 households. The results demonstrate that RLP-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in capturing temporal dependencies and generating load patterns with higher similarity to real data. Furthermore, we have publicly released the RLP-GAN generated synthetic dataset, which comprises one million synthetic residential load pattern profiles.

Abstract: Common machine learning settings range from supervised tasks, where accurately labeled data is accessible, through semi-supervised and weakly-supervised tasks, where target labels are scant or noisy, to unsupervised tasks where labels are unobtainable. In this paper we study a scenario where the target labels are not available but additional related information is at hand. This information, referred to as Side Information, is either correlated with the unknown labels or imposes constraints on the feature space. We formulate the problem as an ensemble of three semantic components: representation learning, side information and metric learning. The proposed scoring model is advantageous for multiple use-cases. For example, in the healthcare domain it can be used to create a severity score for diseases where the symptoms are known but the criteria for the disease progression are not well defined. We demonstrate the utility of the suggested scoring system on well-known benchmark data-sets and bio-medical patient records.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel method called stochastic self-distillation (SSD) for improving performance in deep learning models without increasing model size. By using distillation-time dropout to generate multiple diverse teacher representations and filtering them with a student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD) approach, the proposed method can distill task-relevant knowledge effectively. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that SSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications. The approach incurs minimal computational complexity compared to ensemble learning and weight averaging methods, making it suitable for wearable devices and other low-resource environments. <div>
arXiv:2504.14307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in self-distillation have shown that when knowledge is distilled from a teacher to a student using the same deep learning (DL) architecture, the student performance can surpass the teacher particularly when the network is overparameterized and the teacher is trained with early stopping. Alternatively, ensemble learning also improves performance, although training, storing, and deploying multiple models becomes impractical as the number of models grows. Even distilling an ensemble to a single student model or weight averaging methods first requires training of multiple teacher models and does not fully leverage the inherent stochasticity for generating and distilling diversity in DL models. These constraints are particularly prohibitive in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive applications such as wearable devices. This paper proposes to train only one model and generate multiple diverse teacher representations using distillation-time dropout. However, generating these representations stochastically leads to noisy representations that are misaligned with the learned task. To overcome this problem, a novel stochastic self-distillation (SSD) training strategy is introduced for filtering and weighting teacher representation to distill from task-relevant representations only, using student-guided knowledge distillation (SGKD). The student representation at each distillation step is used as authority to guide the distillation process. Experimental results on real-world affective computing, wearable/biosignal datasets from the UCR Archive, the HAR dataset, and image classification datasets show that the proposed SSD method can outperform state-of-the-art methods without increasing the model size at both training and testing time, and incurs negligible computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art ensemble learning and weight averaging methods.

<div> Keywords: Imbalanced regression, neural networks, LDAO, oversampling, target distribution structure

Summary: 
Imbalanced regression poses challenges for machine learning models, particularly neural networks, due to skewed target distributions. Existing solutions for imbalanced regression often rely on arbitrary thresholds and may discard valuable information. In contrast, the proposed LDAO (Local Distribution-based Adaptive Oversampling) approach avoids categorizing samples as rare or frequent, instead learning the global distribution structure by decomposing the dataset into local distributions. By sampling from each local distribution independently and merging them into a balanced training set, LDAO achieves a balanced representation across the target range while preserving statistical characteristics. Evaluation on 45 imbalanced datasets shows that LDAO outperforms state-of-the-art oversampling methods for both frequent and rare target values, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of imbalanced regression. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced regression occurs when continuous target variables have skewed distributions, creating sparse regions that are difficult for machine learning models to predict accurately. This issue particularly affects neural networks, which often struggle with imbalanced data. While class imbalance in classification has been extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored, with few effective solutions. Existing approaches often rely on arbitrary thresholds to categorize samples as rare or frequent, ignoring the continuous nature of target distributions. These methods can produce synthetic samples that fail to improve model performance and may discard valuable information through undersampling. To address these limitations, we propose LDAO (Local Distribution-based Adaptive Oversampling), a novel data-level approach that avoids categorizing individual samples as rare or frequent. Instead, LDAO learns the global distribution structure by decomposing the dataset into a mixture of local distributions, each preserving its statistical characteristics. LDAO then models and samples from each local distribution independently before merging them into a balanced training set. LDAO achieves a balanced representation across the entire target range while preserving the inherent statistical structure within each local distribution. In extensive evaluations on 45 imbalanced datasets, LDAO outperforms state-of-the-art oversampling methods on both frequent and rare target values, demonstrating its effectiveness for addressing the challenge of imbalanced regression.

Reinforcement learning is crucial for improving large language models (LLMs). However, complex problems can hinder the model's ability to explore and solve efficiently. The new algorithm, Retrospective Replay-based Reinforcement Learning (RRL), addresses this issue by allowing the model to revisit promising states identified early in training. This dynamic replay mechanism enhances exploration effectiveness and efficiency throughout the training process. Extensive experiments on tasks such as mathematical reasoning, code generation, and dialogue tasks show that RRL significantly improves the model's performance in optimizing LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, RRL enhances the safety and helpfulness of the model, making it a more reliable tool for various applications. <br />  <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has increasingly become a pivotal technique in the post-training of large language models (LLMs). The effective exploration of the output space is essential for the success of RL. We observe that for complex problems, during the early stages of training, the model exhibits strong exploratory capabilities and can identify promising solution ideas. However, its limited capability at this stage prevents it from successfully solving these problems. The early suppression of these potentially valuable solution ideas by the policy gradient hinders the model's ability to revisit and re-explore these ideas later. Consequently, although the LLM's capabilities improve in the later stages of training, it still struggles to effectively address these complex problems. To address this exploration issue, we propose a novel algorithm named Retrospective Replay-based Reinforcement Learning (RRL), which introduces a dynamic replay mechanism throughout the training process. RRL enables the model to revisit promising states identified in the early stages, thereby improving its efficiency and effectiveness in exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of RRL, we conduct extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation, and general dialogue tasks. The results indicate that RRL maintains high exploration efficiency throughout the training period, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of RL in optimizing LLMs for complicated reasoning tasks. Moreover, it also improves the performance of RLHF, making the model both safer and more helpful.

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach called FLOW for large language model pruning, allowing for more expressivity in sparse models by considering outlier density. This method selects optimal N and M values for each layer, improving performance by up to 36%. To support flexible N:M patterns, a low-overhead digital compute-in-memory architecture called FlexCiM is proposed. FlexCiM partitions a digital CiM macro into smaller sub-macros, enabling adaptability for different sparsity patterns. Experiments on transformer-based and recurrence-based models show that FLOW outperforms existing methods and FlexCiM achieves lower inference latency and energy consumption compared to other sparse accelerators.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) pruning with fixed N:M structured sparsity significantly limits the expressivity of the sparse model, yielding sub-optimal performance. In contrast, supporting multiple N:M patterns to provide sparse representational freedom introduces costly overhead in hardware. To address these challenges for LLMs, we first present a flexible layer-wise outlier-density-aware N:M sparsity (FLOW) selection method. FLOW enables the identification of optimal layer-wise N and M values (from a given range) by simultaneously accounting for the presence and distribution of outliers, allowing a higher degree of representational freedom. To deploy sparse models with such N:M flexibility, we then introduce a flexible, low-overhead digital compute-in-memory architecture (FlexCiM). FlexCiM supports diverse sparsity patterns by partitioning a digital CiM (DCiM) macro into smaller sub-macros, which are adaptively aggregated and disaggregated through distribution and merging mechanisms for different N and M values. Extensive experiments on both transformer-based and recurrence-based state space foundation models (SSMs) demonstrate that FLOW outperforms existing alternatives with an accuracy improvement of up to 36%, while FlexCiM achieves up to 1.75x lower inference latency and 1.5x lower energy consumption compared to existing sparse accelerators.

<title>Do You Really Need Public Data? Surrogate Public Data for Differential Privacy on Tabular Data</title>

<div> Keywords: Differentially private machine learning, surrogate public data, tabular data, large language models, privacy-utility tradeoff <br />
Summary: <br />
This article introduces the concept of surrogate public data for generating realistic tabular data without accessing sensitive records, using schema-level specifications. It proposes two methods for generating surrogate public data using large language models: direct record generation as CSV files, and automated structural causal model construction for sampling records. Surrogate public data are shown to be effective in pretraining differentially private tabular classifiers, as well as for hyperparameter tuning of DP synthetic data generators and estimating the privacy-utility tradeoff. The use of surrogate public data allows for more accurate and representative data generation in scenarios where traditional public data assumptions may not hold across tabular data domains. <div>
arXiv:2504.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) machine learning often relies on the availability of public data for tasks like privacy-utility trade-off estimation, hyperparameter tuning, and pretraining. While public data assumptions may be reasonable in text and image domains, they are less likely to hold for tabular data due to tabular data heterogeneity across domains. We propose leveraging powerful priors to address this limitation; specifically, we synthesize realistic tabular data directly from schema-level specifications - such as variable names, types, and permissible ranges - without ever accessing sensitive records. To that end, this work introduces the notion of "surrogate" public data - datasets generated independently of sensitive data, which consume no privacy loss budget and are constructed solely from publicly available schema or metadata. Surrogate public data are intended to encode plausible statistical assumptions (informed by publicly available information) into a dataset with many downstream uses in private mechanisms. We automate the process of generating surrogate public data with large language models (LLMs); in particular, we propose two methods: direct record generation as CSV files, and automated structural causal model (SCM) construction for sampling records. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that surrogate public tabular data can effectively replace traditional public data when pretraining differentially private tabular classifiers. To a lesser extent, surrogate public data are also useful for hyperparameter tuning of DP synthetic data generators, and for estimating the privacy-utility tradeoff.

<div> deep learning, bathymetric data, uncertainty quantification, VQ-VAE, coastal hazard prediction

Summary: This study introduces a novel uncertainty-aware approach for improving the resolution of ocean floor maps using deep learning. By incorporating spatial blocks and a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture, the method efficiently captures local bathymetric complexity while providing adaptive uncertainty estimates. The framework enhances reconstruction quality and reliability of uncertainty estimation, particularly in areas with complex seafloor structures. By adjusting uncertainty widths based on local characteristics, the approach offers more accurate predictions and preserves topographical features. This advancement could significantly benefit ocean modeling and coastal hazard assessment by providing more reliable and detailed bathymetric data for improved predictions and risk assessments. <div>
arXiv:2504.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ocean modeling and coastal hazard prediction depend on high-resolution bathymetric data; yet, current worldwide datasets are too coarse for exact numerical simulations. While recent deep learning advances have improved earth observation data resolution, existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of producing detailed ocean floor maps, especially in maintaining physical structure consistency and quantifying uncertainties. This work presents a novel uncertainty-aware mechanism using spatial blocks to efficiently capture local bathymetric complexity based on block-based conformal prediction. Using the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) architecture, the integration of this uncertainty quantification framework yields spatially adaptive confidence estimates while preserving topographical features via discrete latent representations. With smaller uncertainty widths in well-characterized areas and appropriately larger bounds in areas of complex seafloor structures, the block-based design adapts uncertainty estimates to local bathymetric complexity. Compared to conventional techniques, experimental results over several ocean regions show notable increases in both reconstruction quality and uncertainty estimation reliability. This framework increases the reliability of bathymetric reconstructions by preserving structural integrity while offering spatially adaptive uncertainty estimates, so opening the path for more solid climate modeling and coastal hazard assessment.

arXiv:2504.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training conversational question-answering (QA) systems requires a substantial amount of in-domain data, which is often scarce in practice. A common solution to this challenge is to generate synthetic data. Traditional methods typically follow a top-down approach, where a large language model (LLM) generates multi-turn dialogues from a broad prompt. Although this method produces coherent conversations, it offers limited fine-grained control over the content and is susceptible to hallucinations. We introduce a bottom-up conversation synthesis approach, where QA pairs are generated first and then combined into a coherent dialogue. This method offers greater control and precision by dividing the process into two distinct steps, allowing refined instructions and validations to be handled separately. Additionally, this structure allows the use of non-local models in stages that do not involve proprietary knowledge, enhancing the overall quality of the generated data. Both human and automated evaluations demonstrate that our approach produces more realistic and higher-quality dialogues compared to top-down methods.

<title>Balancing Fairness and Performance in Healthcare AI: A Gradient Reconciliation Approach</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of healthcare data and advances in computational power have accelerated the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine. However, AI systems deployed without explicit fairness considerations risk exacerbating existing healthcare disparities, potentially leading to inequitable resource allocation and diagnostic disparities across demographic subgroups. To address this challenge, we propose FairGrad, a novel gradient reconciliation framework that automatically balances predictive performance and multi-attribute fairness optimization in healthcare AI models. Our method resolves conflicting optimization objectives by projecting each gradient vector onto the orthogonal plane of the others, thereby regularizing the optimization trajectory to ensure equitable consideration of all objectives. Evaluated on diverse real-world healthcare datasets and predictive tasks - including Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment and sepsis mortality - FairGrad achieved statistically significant improvements in multi-attribute fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. These results demonstrate the viability of harmonizing fairness and utility in mission-critical medical AI applications.

arXiv:2504.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) have gained attention in meta-learning for their ability to quantify uncertainty, together with their rapid prediction and adaptability. However, traditional NPs are prone to underfitting. Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs) significantly outperform existing NPs, yet their applicability in real-world scenarios is hindered by their quadratic computational complexity relative to both context and target data points. To address this, pseudo-token-based TNPs (PT-TNPs) have emerged as a novel NPs subset that condense context data into latent vectors or pseudo-tokens, reducing computational demands. We introduce the Induced Set Attentive Neural Processes (ISANPs), employing Induced Set Attention and an innovative query phase to improve querying efficiency. Our evaluations show that ISANPs perform competitively with TNPs and often surpass state-of-the-art models in 1D regression, image completion, contextual bandits, and Bayesian optimization. Crucially, ISANPs offer a tunable balance between performance and computational complexity, which scale well to larger datasets where TNPs face limitations.

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to accommodate diverse user preferences is essential for enhancing alignment and user satisfaction. Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches often rely on monolithic value representations, limiting their ability to adapt to individual preferences. We introduce a novel framework that leverages low-rank preference modeling to efficiently learn and generalize user-specific reward functions. By representing reward functions in a low-dimensional subspace and modeling individual preferences as weighted combinations of shared basis functions, our approach avoids rigid user categorization while enabling scalability and few-shot adaptation. We validate our method on multiple preference datasets, demonstrating superior generalization to unseen users and improved accuracy in preference prediction tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adherence to medications is a critical concern since nearly half of patients with chronic illnesses do not follow their prescribed medication regimens, leading to increased mortality, costs, and preventable human distress. Amongst stage 0-3 breast cancer survivors, adherence to long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy (i.e., Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) is associated with a significant increase in recurrence-free survival. This work aims to develop multi-scale models of medication adherence to understand the significance of different factors influencing adherence across varying time frames. We introduce a computational framework guided by Social Cognitive Theory for multi-scale (daily and weekly) modeling of longitudinal medication adherence. Our models employ both dynamic medication-taking patterns in the recent past (dynamic factors) as well as less frequently changing factors (static factors) for adherence prediction. Additionally, we assess the significance of various factors in influencing adherence behavior across different time scales. Our models outperform traditional machine learning counterparts in both daily and weekly tasks in terms of both accuracy and specificity. Daily models achieved an accuracy of 87.25%, and weekly models, an accuracy of 76.04%. Notably, dynamic past medication-taking patterns prove most valuable for predicting daily adherence, while a combination of dynamic and static factors is significant for macro-level weekly adherence patterns.

Abstract: Synthetic training data generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemma and OpenAI's GPT offer a promising solution to the challenge of obtaining large, labeled datasets for training classifiers. When rapid model deployment is critical, such as in classifying emerging social media trends or combating new forms of online abuse tied to current events, the ability to generate training data is invaluable. While prior research has examined the comparability of synthetic data to human-labeled data, this study introduces a novel sampling algorithm, based on the maximum coverage problem, to select a representative subset from a synthetically generated dataset. Our results demonstrate that training a classifier on this contextually sampled subset achieves superior performance compared to training on the entire dataset. This "less is more" approach not only improves accuracy but also reduces the volume of data required, leading to potentially more efficient model fine-tuning.

Abstract: The matrix expressions for every parts of a transformer are firstly described. Based on semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices the hypervectors are reconsidered and the linear transformation over hypervectors is constructed by using projection. Its properties and calculating formulas are obtained. Using projection-based transformation of hypervector (PBTH), the framework of dimension-free transformer (DFT) is proposed by verifying each linear transformation in a transformer and replacing it by a proper PBTH, which allows the inputs and outputs being of arbitrary dimensions. Using balanced information about all entries, DFT must be more efficient in dealing with signals.

<title>SlimPipe: Memory-Thrifty and Efficient Pipeline Parallelism for Long-Context LLM Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14519</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14519</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pipeline Parallelism (PP) serves as a crucial technique for training Large Language Models (LLMs), owing to its capability to alleviate memory pressure from model states with relatively low communication overhead. However, in long-context scenarios, existing pipeline parallelism methods fail to address the substantial activation memory pressure, primarily due to the peak memory consumption resulting from the accumulation of activations across multiple microbatches. Moreover, these approaches inevitably introduce considerable pipeline bubbles, further hindering efficiency.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose SlimPipe, a novel approach to fine-grained pipeline parallelism that employs uniform sequence slicing coupled with one-forward-one-backward (1F1B) schedule. It reduces the accumulated activations from several microbatches to just one, which is split into several slices. Although the slices are evenly partitioned, the computation cost is not equal across slices due to causal attention. We develop a sophisticated workload redistribution technique to address this load imbalance. SlimPipe achieves (1) near-zero memory overhead and (2) minimal pipeline bubbles simultaneously. The effectiveness of SlimPipe has been proven by thorough testing with diverse model architectures, context window sizes, and SlimPipe-specific configurations. For example, on the Llama 70B model, compared to state-of-the-art methods, SlimPipe significantly boosts the Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) to up to $1.57\times$ for a context length of 512K. More notably, for a context length of 2048K, it maintains over 45% utilization on 256 NVIDIA Hopper 80GB GPUs, while other approaches either suffer significant performance drops or fail entirely due to memory constraints.

arXiv:2504.14545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable prediction is an essential requirement for deep neural models that are deployed in open environments, where both covariate and semantic out-of-distribution (OOD) data arise naturally. In practice, to make safe decisions, a reliable model should accept correctly recognized inputs while rejecting both those misclassified covariate-shifted and semantic-shifted examples. Besides, considering the potential existing trade-off between rejecting different failure cases, more convenient, controllable, and flexible failure detection approaches are needed. To meet the above requirements, we propose a simple failure detection framework to unify and facilitate classification with rejection under both covariate and semantic shifts. Our key insight is that by separating and consolidating failure-specific reliability knowledge with low-rank adapters and then integrating them, we can enhance the failure detection ability effectively and flexibly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks but suffer from immense computational and memory demands, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, we propose NoWag: (Normalized Weight and Activation Guided Compression), a unified framework for zero-shot shape preserving compression algorithms. We compressed Llama-2 7B/13B/70B and Llama-3 8/70BB models, using two popular forms of shape-preserving compression, vector quantization NoWag-VQ (NoWag for Vector Quantization), and unstructured/semi-structured pruning NoWag-P (NoWag for Pruning). We found that NoWag-VQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero shot VQ, and that NoWag-P performs competitively against state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest commonalities between these compression paradigms that could inspire future work. Our code is available at https://github.com/LawrenceRLiu/NoWag

Abstract: Learning theory has traditionally followed a model-centric approach, focusing on designing optimal algorithms for a fixed natural learning task (e.g., linear classification or regression). In this paper, we adopt a complementary data-centric perspective, whereby we fix a natural learning rule and focus on optimizing the training data. Specifically, we study the following question: given a learning rule $\mathcal{A}$ and a data selection budget $n$, how well can $\mathcal{A}$ perform when trained on at most $n$ data points selected from a population of $N$ points? We investigate when it is possible to select $n \ll N$ points and achieve performance comparable to training on the entire population.
  We address this question across a variety of empirical risk minimizers. Our results include optimal data-selection bounds for mean estimation, linear classification, and linear regression. Additionally, we establish two general results: a taxonomy of error rates in binary classification and in stochastic convex optimization. Finally, we propose several open questions and directions for future research.

arXiv:2504.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto-bidding, with its strong capability to optimize bidding decisions within dynamic and competitive online environments, has become a pivotal strategy for advertising platforms. Existing approaches typically employ rule-based strategies or Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. However, rule-based strategies lack the flexibility to adapt to time-varying market conditions, and RL-based methods struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observations within Markov Decision Process (MDP) frameworks. Furthermore, these approaches often face challenges in ensuring strategy adaptability across diverse advertising objectives. Additionally, as offline training methods are increasingly adopted to facilitate the deployment and maintenance of stable online strategies, the issues of documented behavioral patterns and behavioral collapse resulting from training on fixed offline datasets become increasingly significant. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel offline Generative Auto-bidding framework with Value-Guided Explorations (GAVE). GAVE accommodates various advertising objectives through a score-based Return-To-Go (RTG) module. Moreover, GAVE integrates an action exploration mechanism with an RTG-based evaluation method to explore novel actions while ensuring stability-preserving updates. A learnable value function is also designed to guide the direction of action exploration and mitigate Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problems. Experimental results on two offline datasets and real-world deployments demonstrate that GAVE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests. The implementation code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

<title>No Imputation of Missing Values In Tabular Data Classification Using Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine learning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by imputation models often concern data stakeholders about computational complexity, data quality, and data-driven outcomes. This paper eliminates these concerns by proposing no imputation incremental learning (NIIL) of tabular data with varying missing value rates and types. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping feature sets while using attention masks to exclude missing values from attention scoring. The average classification performance rank order across 15 diverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of NIIL over 11 state-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations. Further experiments substantiate the robustness of NIIL against varying missing value types and rates compared to methods that involve the imputation of missing values. Our empirical analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half of the original feature space is, computation-wise and accuracy-wise, the best choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one of the first deep learning solutions that can effectively learn tabular data without requiring the imputation of missing values.

Abstract: We employ an evolutionary optimization framework that perturbs initial states to generate informative and diverse policy demonstrations. A joint surrogate fitness function guides the optimization by combining local diversity, behavioral certainty, and global population diversity. To assess demonstration quality, we apply a set of evaluation metrics, including the reward-based optimality gap, fidelity interquartile means (IQMs), fitness composition analysis, and trajectory visualizations. Hyperparameter sensitivity is also examined to better understand the dynamics of trajectory optimization. Our findings demonstrate that optimizing trajectory selection via surrogate fitness metrics significantly improves interpretability of RL policies in both discrete and continuous environments. In gridworld domains, evaluations reveal significantly enhanced demonstration fidelities compared to random and ablated baselines. In continuous control, the proposed framework offers valuable insights, particularly for early-stage policies, while fidelity-based optimization proves more effective for mature policies. By refining and systematically analyzing surrogate fitness functions, this study advances the interpretability of RL models. The proposed improvements provide deeper insights into RL decision-making, benefiting applications in safety-critical and explainability-focused domains.

Abstract: We introduce LeetCodeDataset, a high-quality benchmark for evaluating and training code-generation models, addressing two key challenges in LLM research: the lack of reasoning-focused coding benchmarks and self-contained training testbeds. By curating LeetCode Python problems with rich metadata, broad coverage, 100+ test cases per problem, and temporal splits (pre/post July 2024), our dataset enables contamination-free evaluation and efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experiments show reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning counterparts, while SFT with only 2.6K model-generated solutions achieves performance comparable to 110K-sample counterparts. The dataset and evaluation framework are available on Hugging Face and Github.

<title>Mitigating Parameter Interference in Model Merging via Sharpness-Aware Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models with a pretraining-finetuning paradigm have led to a surge of numerous task-specific models fine-tuned from a common pre-trained model. Recently, several research efforts have been made on merging these large models into a single multi-task model, particularly with simple arithmetic on parameters. Such merging methodology faces a central challenge: interference between model parameters fine-tuned on different tasks. Few recent works have focused on designing a new fine-tuning scheme that can lead to small parameter interference, however at the cost of the performance of each task-specific fine-tuned model and thereby limiting that of a merged model. To improve the performance of a merged model, we note that a fine-tuning scheme should aim for (1) smaller parameter interference and (2) better performance of each fine-tuned model on the corresponding task. In this work, we aim to design a new fine-tuning objective function to work towards these two goals. In the course of this process, we find such objective function to be strikingly similar to sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objective function, which aims to achieve generalization by finding flat minima. Drawing upon our observation, we propose to fine-tune pre-trained models via sharpness-aware minimization. The experimental and theoretical results showcase the effectiveness and orthogonality of our proposed approach, improving performance upon various merging and fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/baiklab/SAFT-Merge.

<title>Efficient Federated Split Learning for Large Language Models over Communication Networks</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLM) in a distributed manner poses significant challenges on resource-constrained edge devices. To address this challenge, we propose FedsLLM, a novel framework that integrates split federated learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. By leveraging model splitting and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), FedsLLM reduces the computational burden on edge devices. Furthermore, the introduction of a federated server facilitates parallel training and enhances privacy. To accommodate heterogeneous communication conditions and diverse computational capabilities of edge devices, as well as the impact of LoRA rank selection on model convergence and training cost, we formulate a joint optimization problem. The formulated problem jointly optimizes subchannel allocation, power control, model splitting point selection, and LoRA rank configuration, all aimed at minimizing total training delay. An alternating optimization algorithm is developed to efficiently solve this problem and accelerate the training process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FedsLLM framework achieves comparable model accuracy while significantly reducing client-side computational requirements. Furthermore, the proposed resource allocation scheme and adaptive LoRA rank selection strategy notably reduce the training latency compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Time series foundation models excel at diverse time series forecasting tasks, but their capacity for continuous improvement through incremental learning remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive study investigating these models' temporal plasticity - their ability to progressively enhance performance through continual learning while maintaining existing capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets exhibiting distribution shifts, we evaluate both conventional deep learning models and foundation models using a novel continual learning framework. Our findings reveal that while traditional models struggle with performance deterioration during incremental fine-tuning, foundation models like Time-MoE and Chronos demonstrate sustained improvement in predictive accuracy. This suggests that optimizing foundation model fine-tuning strategies may be more valuable than developing domain-specific small models. Our research introduces new evaluation methodologies and insights for developing foundation time series models with robust continuous learning capabilities.

<title>Learning Critically: Selective Self Distillation in Federated Learning on Non-IID Data</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model while keeping local data decentralized. Data heterogeneity (non-IID) across clients has imposed significant challenges to FL, which makes local models re-optimize towards their own local optima and forget the global knowledge, resulting in performance degradation and convergence slowdown. Many existing works have attempted to address the non-IID issue by adding an extra global-model-based regularizing item to the local training but without an adaption scheme, which is not efficient enough to achieve high performance with deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a Selective Self-Distillation method for Federated learning (FedSSD), which imposes adaptive constraints on the local updates by self-distilling the global model's knowledge and selectively weighting it by evaluating the credibility at both the class and sample level. The convergence guarantee of FedSSD is theoretically analyzed and extensive experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets, which demonstrates that FedSSD achieves better generalization and robustness in fewer communication rounds, compared with other state-of-the-art FL methods.

Abstract: The evolution of tokens through a deep transformer models can be modeled as an interacting particle system that has been shown to exhibit an asymptotic clustering behavior akin to the synchronization phenomenon in Kuramoto models. In this work, we investigate the long-time clustering of mean-field transformer models. More precisely, we establish exponential rates of contraction to a Dirac point mass for any suitably regular initialization under some assumptions on the parameters of transformer models, any suitably regular mean-field initialization synchronizes exponentially fast with some quantitative rates.

Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that when training a deep neural net with SGD, the majority of the loss landscape's curvature quickly concentrates in a tiny *top* eigenspace of the loss Hessian, which remains largely stable thereafter. Independently, it has been shown that successful magnitude pruning masks for deep neural nets emerge early in training and remain stable thereafter. In this work, we study these two phenomena jointly and show that they are connected: We develop a methodology to measure the similarity between arbitrary parameter masks and Hessian eigenspaces via Grassmannian metrics. We identify *overlap* as the most useful such metric due to its interpretability and stability. To compute *overlap*, we develop a matrix-free algorithm based on sketched SVDs that allows us to compute over 1000 Hessian eigenpairs for nets with over 10M parameters --an unprecedented scale by several orders of magnitude. Our experiments reveal an *overlap* between magnitude parameter masks and top Hessian eigenspaces consistently higher than chance-level, and that this effect gets accentuated for larger network sizes. This result indicates that *top Hessian eigenvectors tend to be concentrated around larger parameters*, or equivalently, that *larger parameters tend to align with directions of larger loss curvature*. Our work provides a methodology to approximate and analyze deep learning Hessians at scale, as well as a novel insight on the structure of their eigenspace.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods have recently become more prominent, serving as a core element in safety-critical autonomous systems. One major purpose of OOD detection is to reject invalid inputs that could lead to unpredictable errors and compromise safety. Due to the cost of labeled data, recent works have investigated the feasibility of self-supervised learning (SSL) OOD detection, unlabeled OOD detection, and zero shot OOD detection. In this work, we identify a set of conditions for a theoretical guarantee of failure in unlabeled OOD detection algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective. These conditions are present in all OOD tasks dealing with real-world data: I) we provide theoretical proof of unlabeled OOD detection failure when there exists zero mutual information between the learning objective and the in-distribution labels, a.k.a. 'label blindness', II) we define a new OOD task - Adjacent OOD detection - that tests for label blindness and accounts for a previously ignored safety gap in all OOD detection benchmarks, and III) we perform experiments demonstrating that existing unlabeled OOD methods fail under conditions suggested by our label blindness theory and analyze the implications for future research in unlabeled OOD methods.

<title>Pairwise or Pointwise? Evaluating Feedback Protocols for Bias in LLM-Based Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as proxies for human labelers in both training (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) and large-scale response evaluation (LLM-as-a-judge). Alignment and evaluation are critical components in the development of reliable LLMs, and the choice of feedback protocol plays a central role in both but remains understudied. In this work, we show that the choice of feedback protocol (absolute scores versus relative preferences) can significantly affect evaluation reliability and induce systematic biases. In particular, we show that pairwise evaluation protocols are more vulnerable to distracted evaluation. Generator models can exploit spurious attributes (or distractor features) favored by the LLM judge, resulting in inflated scores for lower-quality outputs and misleading training signals. We find that absolute scoring is more robust to such manipulation, producing judgments that better reflect response quality and are less influenced by distractor features. Our results demonstrate that generator models can flip preferences by embedding distractor features, skewing LLM-as-a-judge comparisons and leading to inaccurate conclusions about model quality in benchmark evaluations. Pairwise preferences flip in about 35% of the cases, compared to only 9% for absolute scores. We offer recommendations for choosing feedback protocols based on dataset characteristics and evaluation objectives.

Abstract: Humans and most animals inherently possess a distinctive capacity to continually acquire novel experiences and accumulate worldly knowledge over time. This ability, termed continual learning, is also critical for deep neural networks (DNNs) to adapt to the dynamically evolving world in open environments. However, DNNs notoriously suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge when trained on sequential tasks. In this work, inspired by the interactive human memory and learning system, we propose a novel biomimetic continual learning framework that integrates semi-parametric memory and the wake-sleep consolidation mechanism. For the first time, our method enables deep neural networks to retain high performance on novel tasks while maintaining prior knowledge in real-world challenging continual learning scenarios, e.g., class-incremental learning on ImageNet. This study demonstrates that emulating biological intelligence provides a promising path to enable deep neural networks with continual learning capabilities.

Abstract: We present a unified geometric framework for modeling learning dynamics in physical, biological, and machine learning systems. The theory reveals three fundamental regimes, each emerging from the power-law relationship $g \propto \kappa^a$ between the metric tensor $g$ in the space of trainable variables and the noise covariance matrix $\kappa$. The quantum regime corresponds to $a = 1$ and describes Schr\"odinger-like dynamics that emerges from a discrete shift symmetry. The efficient learning regime corresponds to $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ and describes very fast machine learning algorithms. The equilibration regime corresponds to $a = 0$ and describes classical models of biological evolution. We argue that the emergence of the intermediate regime $a = \tfrac{1}{2}$ is a key mechanism underlying the emergence of biological complexity.

Abstract: Designing an effective reward function has long been a challenge in reinforcement learning, particularly for complex tasks in unstructured environments. To address this, various learning paradigms have emerged that leverage different forms of human input to specify or refine the reward function. Reinforcement learning from human feedback is a prominent approach that utilizes human comparative feedback, expressed as a preference for one behavior over another, to tackle this problem. In contrast to comparative feedback, we explore multi-level human feedback, which is provided in the form of a score at the end of each episode. This type of feedback offers more coarse but informative signals about the underlying reward function than binary feedback. Additionally, it can handle non-Markovian rewards, as it is based on the evaluation of an entire episode. We propose an algorithm to efficiently learn both the reward function and the optimal policy from this form of feedback. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness through extensive simulations.

<title>AltGDmin: Alternating GD and Minimization for Partly-Decoupled (Federated) Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14741</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes a novel optimization solution framework, called alternating gradient descent (GD) and minimization (AltGDmin), that is useful for many problems for which alternating minimization (AltMin) is a popular solution. AltMin is a special case of the block coordinate descent algorithm that is useful for problems in which minimization w.r.t one subset of variables keeping the other fixed is closed form or otherwise reliably solved. Denote the two blocks/subsets of the optimization variables Z by Za, Zb, i.e., Z = {Za, Zb}. AltGDmin is often a faster solution than AltMin for any problem for which (i) the minimization over one set of variables, Zb, is much quicker than that over the other set, Za; and (ii) the cost function is differentiable w.r.t. Za. Often, the reason for one minimization to be quicker is that the problem is ``decoupled" for Zb and each of the decoupled problems is quick to solve. This decoupling is also what makes AltGDmin communication-efficient for federated settings.
  Important examples where this assumption holds include (a) low rank column-wise compressive sensing (LRCS), low rank matrix completion (LRMC), (b) their outlier-corrupted extensions such as robust PCA, robust LRCS and robust LRMC; (c) phase retrieval and its sparse and low-rank model based extensions; (d) tensor extensions of many of these problems such as tensor LRCS and tensor completion; and (e) many partly discrete problems where GD does not apply -- such as clustering, unlabeled sensing, and mixed linear regression. LRCS finds important applications in multi-task representation learning and few shot learning, federated sketching, and accelerated dynamic MRI. LRMC and robust PCA find important applications in recommender systems, computer vision and video analytics.

<title>AI for the Open-World: the Learning Principles</title>

Abstract: During the past decades, numerous successes of AI has been made on "specific capabilities", named closed-world, such as artificial environments or specific real-world tasks. This well-defined narrow capability brings two nice benefits, a clear criterion of success and the opportunity to collect a lot of examples. The criteria not only reveal whether a machine has achieved a goal, but reveal how the machine falls short of the goal. As a result, human designers can fix the problems one after the other until the machine is deemed good enough for the task. Furthermore, the large set of collected examples reduces the difficulty of this problem-fixing process (by the central limit theorem).
  Do the success in closed-world translate into broad open-world, where a machine is required to perform any task that a human could possibly undertake with fewer examples and less priori knowledge from human designers? No. Because competence in a specific task provides little insight in handling other tasks, the valuable criteria for specific tasks become helpless when handling broader unseen tasks. Furthermore, due to the shortage of examples in unseen tasks, central limit theorem does not stand on our side. At the end, human designers lose the oscilloscope to "hack" an AI system for the open-world.
  Achieving AI for the open-world requires unique learning principles and innovated techniques, which are different from the ones in building AI for the closed-world. This thesis explores necessary learning principles required to construct AI for the open-world, including rich features (analogy a large tool box), disentangled representation (an organized tool box), and inference-time learning (a tool-savvy hand). Driven by the learning principles, this thesis further proposes techniques to use the learning principles, conducts enormous large-scale experiments to verify the learning principles.

arXiv:2504.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a combinatorial and graph-theoretic theory of dropout by modeling training as a random walk over a high-dimensional graph of binary subnetworks. Each node represents a masked version of the network, and dropout induces stochastic traversal across this space. We define a subnetwork contribution score that quantifies generalization and show that it varies smoothly over the graph. Using tools from spectral graph theory, PAC-Bayes analysis, and combinatorics, we prove that generalizing subnetworks form large, connected, low-resistance clusters, and that their number grows exponentially with network width. This reveals dropout as a mechanism for sampling from a robust, structured ensemble of well-generalizing subnetworks with built-in redundancy. Extensive experiments validate every theoretical claim across diverse architectures. Together, our results offer a unified foundation for understanding dropout and suggest new directions for mask-guided regularization and subnetwork optimization.

Abstract: The traditional techniques for extracting polycrystalline grain structures from microscopy images, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are labour-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming, limiting their scalability for high-throughput analysis. In this study, we present an automated methodology integrating edge detection with generative diffusion models to effectively identify grains, eliminate noise, and connect broken segments in alignment with predicted grain boundaries. Due to the limited availability of adequate images preventing the training of deep machine learning models, a new seven-stage methodology is employed to generate synthetic TEM images for training. This concept-oriented synthetic data approach can be extended to any field of interest where the scarcity of data is a challenge. The presented model was applied to various metals with average grain sizes down to the nanoscale, producing grain morphologies from low-resolution TEM images that are comparable to those obtained from advanced and demanding experimental techniques with an average accuracy of 97.23%.

<title>Enhanced Data-driven Topology Design Methodology with Multi-level Mesh and Correlation-based Mutation for Stress-related Multi-objective Optimization</title>

Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) serves as a widely applied structural design approach to tackle various engineering problems. Nevertheless, sensitivity-based TO methods usually struggle with solving strongly nonlinear optimization problems. By leveraging high capacity of deep generative model, which is an influential machine learning technique, the sensitivity-free data-driven topology design (DDTD) methodology is regarded as an effective means of overcoming these issues. The DDTD methodology depends on initial dataset with a certain regularity, making its results highly sensitive to initial dataset quality. This limits its effectiveness and generalizability, especially for optimization problems without priori information. In this research, we proposed a multi-level mesh DDTD-based method with correlation-based mutation module to escape from the limitation of the quality of the initial dataset on the results and enhance computational efficiency. The core is to employ a correlation-based mutation module to assign new geometric features with physical meaning to the generated data, while utilizing a multi-level mesh strategy to progressively enhance the refinement of the structural representation, thus avoiding the maintenance of a high degree-of-freedom (DOF) representation throughout the iterative process. The proposed multi-level mesh DDTD-based method can be driven by a low quality initial dataset without the need for time-consuming construction of a specific dataset, thus significantly increasing generality and reducing application difficulty, while further lowering computational cost of DDTD methodology. Various comparison experiments with the traditional sensitivity-based TO methods on stress-related strongly nonlinear problems demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Predicting disease states from functional brain connectivity is critical for the early diagnosis of severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. Existing studies commonly employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer clinical diagnoses from node-based brain connectivity matrices generated through node-to-node similarities of regionally averaged fMRI signals. However, recent neuroscience studies found that such node-based connectivity does not accurately capture ``functional connections" within the brain. This paper proposes a novel approach to brain network analysis that emphasizes edge functional connectivity (eFC), shifting the focus to inter-edge relationships. Additionally, we introduce a co-embedding technique to integrate edge functional connections effectively. Experimental results on the ADNI and PPMI datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN methods in classifying functional brain networks.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MUL) is crucial for privacy protection and content regulation, yet recent studies reveal that traces of forgotten information persist in unlearned models, enabling adversaries to resurface removed knowledge. Existing verification methods only confirm whether unlearning was executed, failing to detect such residual information leaks. To address this, we introduce the concept of Robust Unlearning, ensuring models are indistinguishable from retraining and resistant to adversarial recovery. To empirically evaluate whether unlearning techniques meet this security standard, we propose the Unlearning Mapping Attack (UMA), a post-unlearning verification framework that actively probes models for forgotten traces using adversarial queries. Extensive experiments on discriminative and generative tasks show that existing unlearning techniques remain vulnerable, even when passing existing verification metrics. By establishing UMA as a practical verification tool, this study sets a new standard for assessing and enhancing machine unlearning security.

Abstract: The small sample imbalance (S&amp;I) problem is a major challenge in machine learning and data analysis. It is characterized by a small number of samples and an imbalanced class distribution, which leads to poor model performance. In addition, indistinct inter-class feature distributions further complicate classification tasks. Existing methods often rely on algorithmic heuristics without sufficiently analyzing the underlying data characteristics. We argue that a detailed analysis from the data perspective is essential before developing an appropriate solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic analytical framework for the S\&amp;I problem. We first summarize imbalance metrics and complexity analysis methods, highlighting the need for interpretable benchmarks to characterize S&amp;I problems. Second, we review recent solutions for conventional, complexity-based, and extreme S&amp;I problems, revealing methodological differences in handling various data distributions. Our summary finds that resampling remains a widely adopted solution. However, we conduct experiments on binary and multiclass datasets, revealing that classifier performance differences significantly exceed the improvements achieved through resampling. Finally, this paper highlights open questions and discusses future trends.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant progress in various domains, but scaling it to long-horizon tasks with complex decision-making remains challenging. Skill learning attempts to address this by abstracting actions into higher-level behaviors. However, current approaches often fail to recognize semantically similar behaviors as the same skill and use fixed skill lengths, limiting flexibility and generalization. To address this, we propose Dynamic Contrastive Skill Learning (DCSL), a novel framework that redefines skill representation and learning. DCSL introduces three key ideas: state-transition based skill representation, skill similarity function learning, and dynamic skill length adjustment. By focusing on state transitions and leveraging contrastive learning, DCSL effectively captures the semantic context of behaviors and adapts skill lengths to match the appropriate temporal extent of behaviors. Our approach enables more flexible and adaptive skill extraction, particularly in complex or noisy datasets, and demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing methods in task completion and efficiency.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks are powerful tools capable of addressing various tasks. Although the backpropagation algorithm has become a standard training method for these neural networks, its lack of biological plausibility has inspired the development of alternative learning approaches. One such alternative is Kaneko's Error Diffusion Learning Algorithm (EDLA), a biologically motivated approach wherein a single global error signal diffuses throughout a network composed of paired excitatory-inhibitory sublayers, thereby eliminating the necessity for layer-wise backpropagation. This study presents a contemporary formulation of the EDLA framework and evaluates its effectiveness through parity check, regression, and image classification tasks. Our experimental results indicate that EDLA networks can consistently achieve high accuracy across these benchmarks, with performance efficiency and convergence speed notably influenced by the choice of learning rate, neuron count, and network depth. Further investigation of the internal representations formed by EDLA networks reveals their capacity for meaningful feature extraction, similar to traditional neural networks. These results suggest that EDLA is a biologically motivated alternative for training feedforward networks and will motivate future work on extending this method to biologically inspired neural networks.

<title>What Lurks Within? Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.

arXiv:2504.14854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable, approximate inference hypernetwork framework for a general model of history-dependent processes. The flexible data model is based on a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) representing the evolution of internal states together with a trainable observation model subcomponent. The posterior distribution corresponding to the data model parameters (weights and biases) follows a stochastic differential equation with a drift term related to the score of the posterior that is learned jointly with the data model parameters. This Langevin sampling approach offers flexibility in balancing the computational budget between the evaluation cost of the data model and the approximation of the posterior density of its parameters. We demonstrate performance of the hypernetwork on chemical reaction and material physics data and compare it to mean-field variational inference.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to a significant increase in the number of IoT devices, applications, and services. This surge in IoT devices, along with their widespread presence, has made them a prime target for various cyber-attacks, particularly through IoT botnets. As a result, security has become a major concern within the IoT ecosystem. This study focuses on investigating how the latent dimension impacts the performance of different deep learning classifiers when trained on latent vector representations of the train dataset. The primary objective is to compare the outcomes of these models when encoder components from two cutting-edge architectures: the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are utilized to project the high dimensional train dataset to the learned low dimensional latent space. The encoder components are employed to project high-dimensional structured .csv IoT botnet traffic datasets to various latent sizes. Evaluated on N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022 datasets, findings reveal that VAE-encoder based dimension reduction outperforms ViT-encoder based dimension reduction for both datasets in terms of four performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for all models which can be attributed to absence of spatial patterns in the datasets the ViT model attempts to learn and extract from image instances.

<title>Some Optimizers are More Equal: Understanding the Role of Optimizers in Group Fairness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether and how the choice of optimization algorithm can impact group fairness in deep neural networks. Through stochastic differential equation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup, we demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences fairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show that when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and stochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher likelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic category). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter updates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We then validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different tasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label classification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness definitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD in terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. Our results highlight the role of adaptive updates as a crucial yet overlooked mechanism for promoting fair outcomes.

<title>Latent Bayesian Optimization via Autoregressive Normalizing Flows</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been recognized for its effectiveness in optimizing expensive and complex objective functions. Recent advancements in Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) have shown promise by integrating generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) to manage the complexity of high-dimensional and structured data spaces. However, existing LBO approaches often suffer from the value discrepancy problem, which arises from the reconstruction gap between input and latent spaces. This value discrepancy problem propagates errors throughout the optimization process, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a Normalizing Flow-based Bayesian Optimization (NF-BO), which utilizes normalizing flow as a generative model to establish one-to-one encoding function from the input space to the latent space, along with its left-inverse decoding function, eliminating the reconstruction gap. Specifically, we introduce SeqFlow, an autoregressive normalizing flow for sequence data. In addition, we develop a new candidate sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration probability for each token based on its importance. Through extensive experiments, our NF-BO method demonstrates superior performance in molecule generation tasks, significantly outperforming both traditional and recent LBO approaches.

Abstract: Accurate sea state estimation is crucial for the real-time control and future state prediction of autonomous vessels. However, traditional methods struggle with challenges such as data imbalance and feature redundancy in ship motion data, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose the Temporal-Graph Contrastive Clustering Sea State Estimator (TGC-SSE), a novel deep learning model that combines three key components: a time dimension factorization module to reduce data redundancy, a dynamic graph-like learning module to capture complex variable interactions, and a contrastive clustering loss function to effectively manage class imbalance. Our experiments demonstrate that TGC-SSE significantly outperforms existing methods across 14 public datasets, achieving the highest accuracy in 9 datasets, with a 20.79% improvement over EDI. Furthermore, in the field of sea state estimation, TGC-SSE surpasses five benchmark methods and seven deep learning models. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, demonstrating their respective roles in enhancing overall model performance. Overall, TGC-SSE not only improves the accuracy of sea state estimation but also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, providing reliable support for autonomous vessel operations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become a disruptive force in the industry, introducing unprecedented capabilities in natural language processing, logical reasoning and so on. However, the challenges of knowledge updates and hallucination issues have limited the application of LLMs in medical scenarios, where retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can offer significant assistance. Nevertheless, existing retrieve-then-read approaches generally digest the retrieved documents, without considering the timeliness, authoritativeness and commonality of retrieval. We argue that these approaches can be suboptimal, especially in real-world applications where information from different sources might conflict with each other and even information from the same source in different time scale might be different, and totally relying on this would deteriorate the performance of RAG approaches. We propose PolyRAG that carefully incorporate judges from different perspectives and finally integrate the polyviews for retrieval augmented generation in medical applications. Due to the scarcity of real-world benchmarks for evaluation, to bridge the gap we propose PolyEVAL, a benchmark consists of queries and documents collected from real-world medical scenarios (including medical policy, hospital & doctor inquiry and healthcare) with multiple tagging (e.g., timeliness, authoritativeness) on them. Extensive experiments and analysis on PolyEVAL have demonstrated the superiority of PolyRAG.

Abstract: Causal inference aids researchers in discovering cause-and-effect relationships, leading to scientific insights. Accurate causal estimation requires identifying confounding variables to avoid false discoveries. Pearl's causal model uses causal DAGs to identify confounding variables, but incorrect DAGs can lead to unreliable causal conclusions. However, for high dimensional data, the causal DAGs are often complex beyond human verifiability. Graph summarization is a logical next step, but current methods for general-purpose graph summarization are inadequate for causal DAG summarization. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a causal graph summarization objective that balances graph simplification for better understanding while retaining essential causal information for reliable inference. We develop an efficient greedy algorithm and show that summary causal DAGs can be directly used for inference and are more robust to misspecification of assumptions, enhancing robustness for causal inference. Experimenting with six real-life datasets, we compared our algorithm to three existing solutions, showing its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to generate summary DAGs that ensure both reliable causal inference and robustness against misspecifications.

<title>Learning to Reason under Off-Policy Guidance</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning (RL) with simple rule-based rewards. However, existing zero-RL approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY guidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Notably, we propose policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Remarkably, LUFFY achieves an over +7.0 average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over +6.2 points in out-of-distribution tasks. It also substantially surpasses imitation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in generalization. Analysis shows LUFFY not only imitates effectively but also explores beyond demonstrations, offering a scalable path to train generalizable reasoning models with off-policy guidance.

Abstract: As cloud computing continues to evolve, the adoption of multi-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) architecture by cloud service providers has introduced new challenges in virtual machine (VM) scheduling. To address these challenges and more accurately reflect the complexities faced by modern cloud environments, we introduce the Dynamic VM Allocation problem in Multi-NUMA PM (DVAMP). We formally define both offline and online versions of DVAMP as mixed-integer linear programming problems, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for analysis. A tight performance bound for greedy online algorithms is derived, offering insights into the worst-case optimality gap as a function of the number of physical machines and VM lifetime variability. To address the challenges posed by DVAMP, we propose SPANE (Symmetry-Preserving Architecture for Multi-NUMA Environments), a novel deep reinforcement learning approach that exploits the problem's inherent symmetries. SPANE produces invariant results under arbitrary permutations of physical machine states, enhancing learning efficiency and solution quality. Extensive experiments conducted on the Huawei-East-1 dataset demonstrate that SPANE outperforms existing baselines, reducing average VM wait time by 45%. Our work contributes to the field of cloud resource management by providing both theoretical insights and practical solutions for VM scheduling in multi-NUMA environments, addressing a critical gap in the literature and offering improved performance for real-world cloud systems.

Abstract: Textual data question answering has gained significant attention due to its growing applicability. Recently, a novel approach leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method was introduced, utilizing the Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) optimization for sub-graph construction. However, this method focused solely on node attributes, leading to incomplete contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach that replaces the PCST method with an attention-based sub-graph construction technique, enabling more efficient and context-aware retrieval. Additionally, we encode both node and edge attributes, leading to richer graph representations. Our method also incorporates an improved projection layer and multi-head attention pooling for better alignment with Large Language Models (LLMs). Experimental evaluations on the WebQSP dataset demonstrate that our approach is competitive and achieves marginally better results compared to the original method, underscoring its potential for more accurate question answering.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models enhance neural network scalability by dynamically selecting relevant experts per input token, enabling larger model sizes while maintaining manageable computation costs. However, efficient training of large-scale MoE models across thousands of GPUs presents significant challenges due to limitations in existing parallelism strategies. We introduce an end-to-end training framework for large-scale MoE models that utilizes five-dimensional hybrid parallelism: Tensor Parallelism, Expert Parallelism, Context Parallelism, Data Parallelism, and Pipeline Parallelism. Central to our approach is MoE Parallel Folding, a novel strategy that decouples the parallelization of attention and MoE layers in Transformer models, allowing each layer type to adopt optimal parallel configurations. Additionally, we develop a flexible token-level dispatcher that supports both token-dropping and token-dropless MoE training across all five dimensions of parallelism. This dispatcher accommodates dynamic tensor shapes and coordinates different parallelism schemes for Attention and MoE layers, facilitating complex parallelism implementations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in training efficiency and scalability. We achieve up to 49.3% Model Flops Utilization (MFU) for the Mixtral 8x22B model and 39.0% MFU for the Qwen2-57B-A14B model on H100 GPUs, outperforming existing methods. The framework scales efficiently up to 1,024 GPUs and maintains high performance with sequence lengths up to 128K tokens, validating its effectiveness for large-scale MoE model training. The code is available in Megatron-Core.

<title>Learning Compositional Transferability of Time Series for Source-Free Domain Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14994</link>

Abstract: Domain adaptation is challenging for time series classification due to the highly dynamic nature. This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both target labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain adaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data, time series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source time series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply fine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose the learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal patterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to disentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional architecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a U-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the initial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step to prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer adaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a residual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation branch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's output. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their composition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is disentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is retained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the training, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay branch to tolerate instance-wise variation. The experimental results show that such compositional architecture of time series reconstruction leads to SOTA performance on 3 widely used benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in general vision-language tasks. However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology-from training data to reasoning mechanisms-influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: Activation functions are fundamental in deep neural networks and directly impact gradient flow, optimization stability, and generalization. Although ReLU remains standard because of its simplicity, it suffers from vanishing gradients and lacks adaptability. Alternatives like Swish and GELU introduce smooth transitions, but fail to dynamically adjust to input statistics. We propose VeLU, a Variance-enhanced Learning Unit as an activation function that dynamically scales based on input variance by integrating ArcTan-Sin transformations and Wasserstein-2 regularization, effectively mitigating covariate shifts and stabilizing optimization. Extensive experiments on ViT_B16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB3 confirm VeLU's superiority over ReLU, ReLU6, Swish, and GELU on six vision benchmarks. The codes of VeLU are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in transforming natural language questions about relational databases into SQL queries. Despite recent improvements, small LLMs struggle to handle questions involving multiple tables and complex SQL patterns under a Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) setting. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) partially compensate the knowledge deficits in pretrained models but falls short while dealing with queries involving multi-hop reasoning. To bridge this gap, different LLM training strategies to reinforce reasoning capabilities have been proposed, ranging from leveraging a thinking process within ZSL, including reasoning traces in SFT, or adopt Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. However, the influence of reasoning on Text2SQL performance is still largely unexplored. This paper investigates to what extent LLM reasoning capabilities influence their Text2SQL performance on four benchmark datasets. To this end, it considers the following LLM settings: (1) ZSL, including general-purpose reasoning or not; (2) SFT, with and without task-specific reasoning traces; (3) RL, leveraging execution accuracy as primary reward function; (4) SFT+RL, i.e, a two-stage approach that combines SFT and RL. The results show that general-purpose reasoning under ZSL proves to be ineffective in tackling complex Text2SQL cases. Small LLMs benefit from SFT with reasoning much more than larger ones, bridging the gap of their (weaker) model pretraining. RL is generally beneficial across all tested models and datasets, particularly when SQL queries involve multi-hop reasoning and multiple tables. Small LLMs with SFT+RL excel on most complex datasets thanks to a strategic balance between generality of the reasoning process and optimization of the execution accuracy. Thanks to RL, the7B Qwen-Coder-2.5 model performs on par with 100+ Billion ones on the Bird dataset.

Abstract: A recommender system (RS) aims to provide users with personalized item recommendations, enhancing their overall experience. Traditional RSs collect and process all user data on a central server. However, this centralized approach raises significant privacy concerns, as it increases the risk of data breaches and privacy leakages, which are becoming increasingly unacceptable to privacy-sensitive users. To address these privacy challenges, federated learning has been integrated into RSs, ensuring that user data remains secure. In centralized RSs, the issue of rating bias is effectively addressed by jointly analyzing all users' raw interaction data. However, this becomes a significant challenge in federated RSs, as raw data is no longer accessible due to privacy-preserving constraints. To overcome this problem, we propose a Federated Bias-Aware Latent Factor (FBALF) model. In FBALF, training bias is explicitly incorporated into every local model's loss function, allowing for the effective elimination of rating bias without compromising data privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FBALF achieves significantly higher recommendation accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art federated RSs.

Abstract: Up to now, the training processes of typical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are still particularly sensitive to data properties and hyperparameters, which may lead to severe oscillations, difficulties in convergence, or even failures to converge, especially when the overall variances of the training sets are large. These phenomena are often attributed to the training characteristics of such networks. Aiming at the problem, this paper develops a new intelligent optimizer, Fast-Slow Co-advancing Optimizer (FSCO), which employs reinforcement learning in the training process of GANs to make training easier. Specifically, this paper allows the training step size to be controlled by an agent to improve training stability, and makes the training process more intelligent with variable learning rates, making GANs less sensitive to step size. Experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets to verify the effectiveness of the developed FSCO.

Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha < s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.

Abstract: The training of artificial neural networks is heavily dependent on the careful selection of an appropriate loss function. While commonly used loss functions, such as cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE), generally suffice for a broad range of tasks, challenges often emerge due to limitations in data quality or inefficiencies within the learning process. In such circumstances, the integration of supplementary terms into the loss function can serve to address these challenges, enhancing both model performance and robustness. Two prominent techniques, loss regularization and contrastive learning, have been identified as effective strategies for augmenting the capacity of loss functions in artificial neural networks.
  Knowledge tracing is a compelling area of research that leverages predictive artificial intelligence to facilitate the automation of personalized and efficient educational experiences for students. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the deep learning-based knowledge tracing (DKT) algorithms trained using advanced loss functions and discuss their improvements over prior techniques. We discuss contrastive knowledge tracing algorithms, such as Bi-CLKT, CL4KT, SP-CLKT, CoSKT, and prediction-consistent DKT, providing performance benchmarks and insights into real-world deployment challenges. The survey concludes with future research directions, including hybrid loss strategies and context-aware modeling.

<title>Audio-Visual Class-Incremental Learning for Fish Feeding intensity Assessment in Aquaculture</title>

Abstract: Fish Feeding Intensity Assessment (FFIA) is crucial in industrial aquaculture management. Recent multi-modal approaches have shown promise in improving FFIA robustness and efficiency. However, these methods face significant challenges when adapting to new fish species or environments due to catastrophic forgetting and the lack of suitable datasets. To address these limitations, we first introduce AV-CIL-FFIA, a new dataset comprising 81,932 labelled audio-visual clips capturing feeding intensities across six different fish species in real aquaculture environments. Then, we pioneer audio-visual class incremental learning (CIL) for FFIA and demonstrate through benchmarking on AV-CIL-FFIA that it significantly outperforms single-modality methods. Existing CIL methods rely heavily on historical data. Exemplar-based approaches store raw samples, creating storage challenges, while exemplar-free methods avoid data storage but struggle to distinguish subtle feeding intensity variations across different fish species. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HAIL-FFIA, a novel audio-visual class-incremental learning framework that bridges this gap with a prototype-based approach that achieves exemplar-free efficiency while preserving essential knowledge through compact feature representations. Specifically, HAIL-FFIA employs hierarchical representation learning with a dual-path knowledge preservation mechanism that separates general intensity knowledge from fish-specific characteristics. Additionally, it features a dynamic modality balancing system that adaptively adjusts the importance of audio versus visual information based on feeding behaviour stages. Experimental results show that HAIL-FFIA is superior to SOTA methods on AV-CIL-FFIA, achieving higher accuracy with lower storage needs while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental fish species learning.

<title>How Global Calibration Strengthens Multiaccuracy</title>

Abstract: Multiaccuracy and multicalibration are multigroup fairness notions for prediction that have found numerous applications in learning and computational complexity. They can be achieved from a single learning primitive: weak agnostic learning. Here we investigate the power of multiaccuracy as a learning primitive, both with and without the additional assumption of calibration. We find that multiaccuracy in itself is rather weak, but that the addition of global calibration (this notion is called calibrated multiaccuracy) boosts its power substantially, enough to recover implications that were previously known only assuming the stronger notion of multicalibration.
  We give evidence that multiaccuracy might not be as powerful as standard weak agnostic learning, by showing that there is no way to post-process a multiaccurate predictor to get a weak learner, even assuming the best hypothesis has correlation $1/2$. Rather, we show that it yields a restricted form of weak agnostic learning, which requires some concept in the class to have correlation greater than $1/2$ with the labels. However, by also requiring the predictor to be calibrated, we recover not just weak, but strong agnostic learning.
  A similar picture emerges when we consider the derivation of hardcore measures from predictors satisfying multigroup fairness notions. On the one hand, while multiaccuracy only yields hardcore measures of density half the optimal, we show that (a weighted version of) calibrated multiaccuracy achieves optimal density.
  Our results yield new insights into the complementary roles played by multiaccuracy and calibration in each setting. They shed light on why multiaccuracy and global calibration, although not particularly powerful by themselves, together yield considerably stronger notions.

<title>Compute-Optimal LLMs Provably Generalize Better With Scale</title>

Abstract: Why do larger language models generalize better? To investigate this question, we develop generalization bounds on the pretraining objective of large language models (LLMs) in the compute-optimal regime, as described by the Chinchilla scaling laws. We introduce a novel, fully empirical Freedman-type martingale concentration inequality that tightens existing bounds by accounting for the variance of the loss function. This generalization bound can be decomposed into three interpretable components: the number of parameters per token, the loss variance, and the quantization error at a fixed bitrate. As compute-optimal language models are scaled up, the number of parameters per data point remains constant; however, both the loss variance and the quantization error decrease, implying that larger models should have smaller generalization gaps. We examine why larger models tend to be more quantizable from an information theoretic perspective, showing that the rate at which they can integrate new information grows more slowly than their capacity on the compute-optimal frontier. From these findings we produce a scaling law for the generalization gap, with bounds that become predictably stronger with scale.

<title>A Causal Convolutional Low-rank Representation Model for Imputation of Water Quality Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15209</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The monitoring of water quality is a crucial part of environmental protection, and a large number of monitors are widely deployed to monitor water quality. Due to unavoidable factors such as data acquisition breakdowns, sensors and communication failures, water quality monitoring data suffers from missing values over time, resulting in High-Dimensional and Sparse (HDS) Water Quality Data (WQD). The simple and rough filling of the missing values leads to inaccurate results and affects the implementation of relevant measures. Therefore, this paper proposes a Causal convolutional Low-rank Representation (CLR) model for imputing missing WQD to improve the completeness of the WQD, which employs a two-fold idea: a) applying causal convolutional operation to consider the temporal dependence of the low-rank representation, thus incorporating temporal information to improve the imputation accuracy; and b) implementing a hyperparameters adaptation scheme to automatically adjust the best hyperparameters during model training, thereby reducing the tedious manual adjustment of hyper-parameters. Experimental studies on three real-world water quality datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLR model is superior to some of the existing state-of-the-art imputation models in terms of imputation accuracy and time cost, as well as indicating that the proposed model provides more reliable decision support for environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods adapt large artificial neural networks to downstream tasks without fine-tuning the entire model. However, existing additive methods, such as adapters, sometimes struggle to capture distributional shifts in intermediate feature embeddings. We propose a novel histogram-based parameter-efficient tuning (HPT) technique that captures the statistics of the target domain and modulates the embeddings. Experimental results on three downstream passive sonar datasets (ShipsEar, DeepShip, VTUAD) demonstrate that HPT outperforms conventional adapters. Notably, HPT achieves 91.8% vs. 89.8% accuracy on VTUAD. Furthermore, HPT trains faster and yields feature representations closer to those of fully fine-tuned models. Overall, HPT balances parameter savings and performance, providing a distribution-aware alternative to existing adapters and shows a promising direction for scalable transfer learning in resource-constrained environments. The code is publicly available: https://github.com/Advanced-Vision-and-Learning-Lab/HLAST_DeepShip_ParameterEfficient.

<title>A Deep Learning Framework for Sequence Mining with Bidirectional LSTM and Multi-Scale Attention</title>

arXiv:2504.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of mining latent patterns and modeling contextual dependencies in complex sequence data. A sequence pattern mining algorithm is proposed by integrating Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with a multi-scale attention mechanism. The BiLSTM captures both forward and backward dependencies in sequences, enhancing the model's ability to perceive global contextual structures. At the same time, the multi-scale attention module assigns adaptive weights to key feature regions under different window sizes. This improves the model's responsiveness to both local and global important information. Extensive experiments are conducted on a publicly available multivariate time series dataset. The proposed model is compared with several mainstream sequence modeling methods. Results show that it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. This confirms the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed architecture in complex pattern recognition tasks. Further ablation studies and sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the effects of attention scale and input sequence length on model performance. These results provide empirical support for structural optimization of the model.

<title>M$^2$AD: Multi-Sensor Multi-System Anomaly Detection through Global Scoring and Calibrated Thresholding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread availability of sensor data across industrial and operational systems, we frequently encounter heterogeneous time series from multiple systems. Anomaly detection is crucial for such systems to facilitate predictive maintenance. However, most existing anomaly detection methods are designed for either univariate or single-system multivariate data, making them insufficient for these complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce M$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models to capture expected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators of potential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly score through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically demonstrate that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and dependencies across sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms existing methods in extensive evaluations by 21% on average, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale real-world case study on 130 assets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers. Our code and results are available at https://github.com/sarahmish/M2AD.

Abstract: This paper explores uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods in the context of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We apply an ensemble approach to KANs to obtain a heuristic measure of UQ, enhancing interpretability and robustness in modeling complex functions. Building on this, we introduce Conformalized-KANs, which integrate conformal prediction, a distribution-free UQ technique, with KAN ensembles to generate calibrated prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, focusing particularly on the robustness and accuracy of the prediction intervals under various hyperparameter settings. We show that the conformal KAN predictions can be applied to recent extensions of KANs, including Finite Basis KANs (FBKANs) and multifideilty KANs (MFKANs). The results demonstrate the potential of our approaches to improve the reliability and applicability of KANs in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Constrained optimization with multiple functional inequality constraints has significant applications in machine learning. This paper examines a crucial subset of such problems where both the objective and constraint functions are weakly convex. Existing methods often face limitations, including slow convergence rates or reliance on double-loop algorithmic designs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel single-loop penalty-based stochastic algorithm. Following the classical exact penalty method, our approach employs a {\bf hinge-based penalty}, which permits the use of a constant penalty parameter, enabling us to achieve a {\bf state-of-the-art complexity} for finding an approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. We further extend our algorithm to address finite-sum coupled compositional objectives, which are prevalent in artificial intelligence applications, establishing improved complexity over existing approaches. Finally, we validate our method through experiments on fair learning with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) fairness constraints and continual learning with non-forgetting constraints.

Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of learning Boolean disjunctions in the distribution-free agnostic PAC model. The best known agnostic learner for the class of disjunctions over $\{0, 1\}^n$ is the $L_1$-polynomial regression algorithm, achieving complexity $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})}$. This complexity bound is known to be nearly best possible within the class of Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) algorithms. In this work, we develop an agnostic learner for this concept class with complexity $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}$. Our algorithm can be implemented in the Statistical Query (SQ) model, providing the first separation between the SQ and CSQ models in distribution-free agnostic learning.

Abstract: We study the complexity of learning $k$-mixtures of Gaussians ($k$-GMMs) on $\mathbb{R}^d$. This task is known to have complexity $d^{\Omega(k)}$ in full generality. To circumvent this exponential lower bound on the number of components, research has focused on learning families of GMMs satisfying additional structural properties. A natural assumption posits that the component weights are not exponentially small and that the components have the same unknown covariance. Recent work gave a $d^{O(\log(1/w_{\min}))}$-time algorithm for this class of GMMs, where $w_{\min}$ is the minimum weight. Our first main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that this quasi-polynomial upper bound is essentially best possible, even for the special case of uniform weights. Specifically, we show that it is SQ-hard to distinguish between such a mixture and the standard Gaussian. We further explore how the distribution of weights affects the complexity of this task. Our second main result is a quasi-polynomial upper bound for the aforementioned testing task when most of the weights are uniform while a small fraction of the weights are potentially arbitrary.

arXiv:2504.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic and memorizes excessively; comparatively, multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, in our tasks, we find that to elicit randomness from the Transformer without hurting coherence, it is better to inject noise right at the input layer (via a method we dub hash-conditioning) rather than defer to temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and softmax-based sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) systems facilitate distributed machine learning across a server and multiple devices. However, FL systems have low resource utilization limiting their practical use in the real world. This inefficiency primarily arises from two types of idle time: (i) task dependency between the server and devices, and (ii) stragglers among heterogeneous devices. This paper introduces FedOptima, a resource-optimized FL system designed to simultaneously minimize both types of idle time; existing systems do not eliminate or reduce both at the same time. FedOptima offloads the training of certain layers of a neural network from a device to server using three innovations. First, devices operate independently of each other using asynchronous aggregation to eliminate straggler effects, and independently of the server by utilizing auxiliary networks to minimize idle time caused by task dependency. Second, the server performs centralized training using a task scheduler that ensures balanced contributions from all devices, improving model accuracy. Third, an efficient memory management mechanism on the server increases scalability of the number of participating devices. Four state-of-the-art offloading-based and asynchronous FL methods are chosen as baselines. Experimental results show that compared to the best results of the baselines on convolutional neural networks and transformers on multiple lab-based testbeds, FedOptima (i) achieves higher or comparable accuracy, (ii) accelerates training by 1.9x to 21.8x, (iii) reduces server and device idle time by up to 93.9% and 81.8%, respectively, and (iv) increases throughput by 1.1x to 2.0x.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Translational Evaluation of Multimodal AI for Inspection (TEMAI) framework, bridging multimodal AI capabilities with industrial inspection implementation. Adapting translational research principles from healthcare to industrial contexts, TEMAI establishes three core dimensions: Capability (technical feasibility), Adoption (organizational readiness), and Utility (value realization). The framework demonstrates that technical capability alone yields limited value without corresponding adoption mechanisms. TEMAI incorporates specialized metrics including the Value Density Coefficient and structured implementation pathways. Empirical validation through retail and photovoltaic inspection implementations revealed significant differences in value realization patterns despite similar capability reduction rates, confirming the framework's effectiveness across diverse industrial sectors while highlighting the importance of industry-specific adaptation strategies.

Abstract: This study estimates cognitive effort (CE) based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and performance scores using a hybrid deep learning model. The estimation of CE enables educators to modify material to enhance learning effectiveness and student engagement. Relative neural efficiency (RNE) and relative neural involvement (RNI) are two metrics that have been used to represent CE. To estimate RNE and RNI we need hemodynamic response in the brain and the performance score of a task.We collected oxygenated hemoglobin ($\Delta \mathrm{HbO}$). Sixteen participants answered 16 questions in a unity-based educational game, each with a 30-second response time. We used deep learning models to predict the performance score and estimate RNE and RNI to understand CE. The study compares traditional machine learning techniques with deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and a hybrid CNN-GRU to determine which approach provides better accuracy in predicting performance scores. The result shows that the hybrid CNN-GRU gives better performance with 78.36\% training accuracy and 73.08\% test accuracy than other models. We performed XGBoost on the extracted GRU feature and got the highest accuracy (69.23\%). This suggests that the features learned from this hybrid model generalize better even in traditional machine learning algorithms. We used the $\Delta \mathrm{HbO}$ and predicted score to calculate RNE and RNI to observe cognitive effort in our four test cases. Our result shows that even with moderate accuracy, the predicted RNE and RNI closely follows the actual trends. we also observed that when participants were in a state of high CE, introducing rest led decrease of CE. These findings can be helpful to design and improve learning environments and provide valuable insights in learning materials.

Abstract: App agents, which autonomously operate mobile Apps through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), have gained significant interest in real-world applications. Yet, they often struggle with long-horizon planning, failing to find the optimal actions for complex tasks with longer steps. To address this, world models are used to predict the next GUI observation based on user actions, enabling more effective agent planning. However, existing world models primarily focus on generating only textual descriptions, lacking essential visual details. To fill this gap, we propose ViMo, the first visual world model designed to generate future App observations as images. For the challenge of generating text in image patches, where even minor pixel errors can distort readability, we decompose GUI generation into graphic and text content generation. We propose a novel data representation, the Symbolic Text Representation~(STR) to overlay text content with symbolic placeholders while preserving graphics. With this design, ViMo employs a STR Predictor to predict future GUIs' graphics and a GUI-text Predictor for generating the corresponding text. Moreover, we deploy ViMo to enhance agent-focused tasks by predicting the outcome of different action options. Experiments show ViMo's ability to generate visually plausible and functionally effective GUIs that enable App agents to make more informed decisions.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often criticized as opaque from a lack of transparency in their decision-making process. This study examines how policy design impacts the quality of explanations in ML models. We conducted a classroom experiment with 124 participants and analyzed the effects of policy length and purpose on developer compliance with policy requirements. Our results indicate that while policy length affects engagement with some requirements, policy purpose has no effect, and explanation quality is generally poor. These findings highlight the challenge of effective policy development and the importance of addressing diverse stakeholder perspectives within explanations.

Abstract: The advancement of AI systems for mental health support is hindered by limited access to therapeutic conversation data, particularly for trauma treatment. We present Thousand Voices of Trauma, a synthetic benchmark dataset of 3,000 therapy conversations based on Prolonged Exposure therapy protocols for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The dataset comprises 500 unique cases, each explored through six conversational perspectives that mirror the progression of therapy from initial anxiety to peak distress to emotional processing. We incorporated diverse demographic profiles (ages 18-80, M=49.3, 49.4% male, 44.4% female, 6.2% non-binary), 20 trauma types, and 10 trauma-related behaviors using deterministic and probabilistic generation methods. Analysis reveals realistic distributions of trauma types (witnessing violence 10.6%, bullying 10.2%) and symptoms (nightmares 23.4%, substance abuse 20.8%). Clinical experts validated the dataset's therapeutic fidelity, highlighting its emotional depth while suggesting refinements for greater authenticity. We also developed an emotional trajectory benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating model responses. This privacy-preserving dataset addresses critical gaps in trauma-focused mental health data, offering a valuable resource for advancing both patient-facing applications and clinician training tools.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key indicator of soil health, fertility, and carbon sequestration, making it essential for sustainable land management and climate change mitigation. However, large-scale SOC monitoring remains challenging due to spatial variability, temporal dynamics, and multiple influencing factors. We present WALGREEN, a platform that enhances SOC inference by overcoming limitations of current applications. Leveraging machine learning and diverse soil samples, WALGREEN generates predictive models using historical public and private data. Built on cloud-based technologies, it offers a user-friendly interface for researchers, policymakers, and land managers to access carbon data, analyze trends, and support evidence-based decision-making. Implemented in Python, Java, and JavaScript, WALGREEN integrates Google Earth Engine and Sentinel Copernicus via scripting, OpenLayers, and Thymeleaf in a Model-View-Controller framework. This paper aims to advance soil science, promote sustainable agriculture, and drive critical ecosystem responses to climate change.

Abstract: Background. Diet and inflammation are critical factors influencing cancer risk. However, the combined impact of nutritional status and inflammatory biomarkers on cancer status and type, using machine learning (ML), remains underexplored.
  Objectives. This study investigates the association between nutritional factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and cancer status, and whether these relationships differ across cancer types using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data.
  Methods. We analyzed 24 macro- and micronutrients, C-reactive protein (CRP), and the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in 26,409 NHANES participants (2,120 with cancer). Multivariable logistic regression assessed associations with cancer prevalence. We also examined whether these features differed across the five most common cancer types. To evaluate predictive value, we applied three ML models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost - on the full feature set.
  Results. The cohort's mean age was 49.1 years; 34.7% were obese. Comorbidities such as anemia and liver conditions, along with nutritional factors like protein and several vitamins, were key predictors of cancer status. Among the models, Random Forest performed best, achieving an accuracy of 0.72.
  Conclusions. Higher-quality nutritional intake and lower levels of inflammation may offer protective effects against cancer. These findings highlight the potential of combining nutritional and inflammatory markers with ML to inform cancer prevention strategies.

<title>CPR: Leveraging LLMs for Topic and Phrase Suggestion to Facilitate Comprehensive Product Reviews</title>

Abstract: Consumers often heavily rely on online product reviews, analyzing both quantitative ratings and textual descriptions to assess product quality. However, existing research hasn't adequately addressed how to systematically encourage the creation of comprehensive reviews that capture both customers sentiment and detailed product feature analysis. This paper presents CPR, a novel methodology that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Topic Modeling to guide users in crafting insightful and well-rounded reviews. Our approach employs a three-stage process: first, we present users with product-specific terms for rating; second, we generate targeted phrase suggestions based on these ratings; and third, we integrate user-written text through topic modeling, ensuring all key aspects are addressed. We evaluate CPR using text-to-text LLMs, comparing its performance against real-world customer reviews from Walmart. Our results demonstrate that CPR effectively identifies relevant product terms, even for new products lacking prior reviews, and provides sentiment-aligned phrase suggestions, saving users time and enhancing reviews quality. Quantitative analysis reveals a 12.3% improvement in BLEU score over baseline methods, further supported by manual evaluation of generated phrases. We conclude by discussing potential extensions and future research directions.

Abstract: We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.

Abstract: Knitting, a cornerstone of textile manufacturing, is uniquely challenging to automate, particularly in terms of converting fabric designs into precise, machine-readable instructions. This research bridges the gap between textile production and robotic automation by proposing a novel deep learning-based pipeline for reverse knitting to integrate vision-based robotic systems into textile manufacturing. The pipeline employs a two-stage architecture, enabling robots to first identify front labels before inferring complete labels, ensuring accurate, scalable pattern generation. By incorporating diverse yarn structures, including single-yarn (sj) and multi-yarn (mj) patterns, this study demonstrates how our system can adapt to varying material complexities. Critical challenges in robotic textile manipulation, such as label imbalance, underrepresented stitch types, and the need for fine-grained control, are addressed by leveraging specialized deep-learning architectures. This work establishes a foundation for fully automated robotic knitting systems, enabling customizable, flexible production processes that integrate perception, planning, and actuation, thereby advancing textile manufacturing through intelligent robotic automation.

<title>Causal pieces: analysing and improving spiking neural networks piece by piece</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We introduce a novel concept for spiking neural networks (SNNs) derived from the idea of "linear pieces" used to analyse the expressiveness and trainability of artificial neural networks (ANNs). We prove that the input domain of SNNs decomposes into distinct causal regions where its output spike times are locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to the input spike times and network parameters. The number of such regions - which we call "causal pieces" - is a measure of the approximation capabilities of SNNs. In particular, we demonstrate in simulation that parameter initialisations which yield a high number of causal pieces on the training set strongly correlate with SNN training success. Moreover, we find that feedforward SNNs with purely positive weights exhibit a surprisingly high number of causal pieces, allowing them to achieve competitive performance levels on benchmark tasks. We believe that causal pieces are not only a powerful and principled tool for improving SNNs, but might also open up new ways of comparing SNNs and ANNs in the future.

Abstract: Practitioners often struggle with the overwhelming number of security practices outlined in cybersecurity frameworks for risk mitigation. Given the limited budget, time, and resources, practitioners want to prioritize the adoption of security practices based on empirical evidence. The goal of this study is to assist practitioners and policymakers in making informed decisions on which security practices to adopt by evaluating the relationship between software security practices and security outcome metrics. The study investigated the relationship between security practice adoption and security outcomes. We selected the OpenSSF Scorecard metrics to automatically measure the adoption of security practices in npm GitHub repositories. We also explored security outcome metrics, such as the number of open vulnerabilities (Vul_Count), mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities in dependencies, and mean time to update (MTTU) dependencies. We conducted regression and causal analysis using 12 Scorecard metrics and their aggregated Scorecard score (computed by aggregating individual security practice scores) as predictors and Vul_Count, MTTR, and MTTU as target variables. Our findings show that higher aggregated Scorecard scores are associated with fewer Vul_Count and shorter MTTU, also supported by causal analysis. However, while the regression model suggests shorter MTTR, causal analysis indicates project characteristics likely influence MTTR direction. Segment analysis shows that larger, newer repositories with more contributors, dependencies, and downloads have shorter MTTR. Among individual security practices, Code Review, Maintained status, Pinned Dependencies, and Branch Protection show strong associations with security outcomes; the directionality of these associations varies across security outcomes.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINOv2 and CLIP have achieved impressive results on various downstream tasks, but their limited feature resolution hampers performance in applications requiring pixel-level understanding. Feature upsampling offers a promising direction to address this challenge. In this work, we identify two critical factors for enhancing feature upsampling: the upsampler architecture and the training objective. For the upsampler architecture, we introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer that integrates the high-resolution images with coordinates and low-resolution VFM features to generate sharp, high-quality features. For the training objective, we propose constructing high-resolution pseudo-groundtruth features by leveraging class-agnostic masks and self-distillation. Our approach effectively captures fine-grained details and adapts flexibly to various input and feature resolutions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing feature upsampling techniques across various downstream tasks. Our code is released at https://github.com/andrehuang/loftup.

<title>Sentiment Analysis of Airbnb Reviews: Exploring Their Impact on Acceptance Rates and Pricing Across Multiple U.S. Regions</title>

Abstract: This research examines whether Airbnb guests' positive and negative comments influence acceptance rates and rental prices across six U.S. regions: Rhode Island, Broward County, Chicago, Dallas, San Diego, and Boston. Thousands of reviews were collected and analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify sentiments as positive or negative, followed by statistical testing (t-tests and basic correlations) on the average scores. The findings reveal that over 90 percent of reviews in each region are positive, indicating that having additional reviews does not significantly enhance prices. However, listings with predominantly positive feedback exhibit slightly higher acceptance rates, suggesting that sentiment polarity, rather than the sheer volume of reviews, is a more critical factor for host success. Additionally, budget listings often gather extensive reviews while maintaining competitive pricing, whereas premium listings sustain higher prices with fewer but highly positive reviews. These results underscore the importance of sentiment quality over quantity in shaping guest behavior and pricing strategies in an overwhelmingly positive review environment.

Abstract: Standard semantic instance segmentation provides useful, but inherently 2D information from a single image. To enable 3D analysis, one usually integrates absolute monocular depth estimation with instance segmentation. However, monocular depth is a difficult task. Instead, we leverage a simpler single-image task, occlusion-based relative depth ordering, providing coarser but useful 3D information. We show that relative depth ordering works more reliably from occlusions than from absolute depth. We propose to solve the joint task of relative depth ordering and segmentation of instances based on occlusions. We call this task Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation (OOSIS). We develop an approach to OOSIS that extracts instances and their occlusion order simultaneously from oriented occlusion boundaries and semantic segmentation. Unlike popular detect-and-segment framework for instance segmentation, combining occlusion ordering with instance segmentation allows a simple and clean formulation of OOSIS as a labeling problem. As a part of our solution for OOSIS, we develop a novel oriented occlusion boundaries approach that significantly outperforms prior work. We also develop a new joint OOSIS metric based both on instance mask accuracy and correctness of their occlusion order. We achieve better performance than strong baselines on KINS and COCOA datasets.

Abstract: With the recent developments in machine intelligence and web technologies, new generative music systems are being explored for assisted composition using machine learning techniques on the web. Such systems are built for various tasks such as melodic, harmonic or rhythm generation, music interpolation, continuation and style imitation. In this paper, we introduce Apollo, an interactive music application for generating symbolic phrases of conventional western music using corpus-based style imitation techniques. In addition to enabling the construction and management of symbolic musical corpora, the system makes it possible for music artists and researchers to generate new musical phrases in the style of the proposed corpus. The system is available as a desktop application. The generated symbolic music materials, encoded in the MIDI format, can be exported or streamed for various purposes including using them as seed material for musical projects. We present the system design, implementation details, discuss and conclude with future work for the system.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in its application towards creative domains, including music. There exist many systems built that apply machine learning approaches to the problem of computer-assisted music composition (CAC). Calliope is a web application that assists users in performing a variety of multi-track composition tasks in the symbolic domain. The user can upload (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) MIDI files, visualize and edit MIDI tracks, and generate partial (via bar in-filling) or complete multi-track content using the Multi-Track Music Machine (MMM). Generation of new MIDI excerpts can be done in batch and can be combined with active playback listening for an enhanced assisted-composition workflow. The user can export generated MIDI materials or directly stream MIDI playback from the system to their favorite Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). We present a demonstration of the system, its features, generative parameters and describe the co-creative workflows that it affords.

Abstract: We present a baseline for the CLPsych 2025 A.1 task: classifying self-states in mental health data taken from Reddit. We use few-shot learning with a 4-bit quantized Gemma 2 9B model and a data preprocessing step which first identifies relevant sentences indicating self-state evidence, and then performs a binary classification to determine whether the sentence is evidence of an adaptive or maladaptive self-state. This system outperforms our other method which relies on an LLM to highlight spans of variable length independently. We attribute the performance of our model to the benefits of this sentence chunking step for two reasons: partitioning posts into sentences 1) broadly matches the granularity at which self-states were human-annotated and 2) simplifies the task for our language model to a binary classification problem. Our system places third out of fourteen systems submitted for Task A.1, achieving a test-time recall of 0.579.

Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been increasing interest in human-AI co-creation in a variety of artistic domains including music as AI-driven systems are frequently able to generate human-competitive artifacts. Now, the implications of such systems for musical practice are being investigated. We report on a thorough evaluation of the user adoption of the Multi-Track Music Machine (MMM) as a co-creative AI tool for music composers. To do this, we integrate MMM into Cubase, a popular Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) by Steinberg, by producing a "1-parameter" plugin interface named MMM-Cubase (MMM-C), which enables human-AI co-composition. We contribute a methodological assemblage as a 3-part mixed method study measuring usability, user experience and technology acceptance of the system across two groups of expert-level composers: hobbyists and professionals. Results show positive usability and acceptance scores. Users report experiences of novelty, surprise and ease of use from using the system, and limitations on controllability and predictability of the interface when generating music. Findings indicate no significant difference between the two user groups.

Abstract: Advancements in audio neural networks have established state-of-the-art results on downstream audio tasks. However, the black-box structure of these models makes it difficult to interpret the information encoded in their internal audio representations. In this work, we explore the semantic interpretability of audio embeddings extracted from these neural networks by leveraging CLAP, a contrastive learning model that brings audio and text into a shared embedding space. We implement a post-hoc method to transform CLAP embeddings into concept-based, sparse representations with semantic interpretability. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the concept-based representations outperform or match the performance of original audio embeddings on downstream tasks while providing interpretability. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the concept-based representations can further improve their performance on downstream tasks. Lastly, we publish three audio-specific vocabularies for concept-based interpretability of audio embeddings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities across various domains. However, LLMs still face distinct challenges in complex logical reasoning, as (1) proof-finding requires systematic exploration and the maintenance of logical coherence and (2) searching the right combination of premises at each reasoning step is inherently challenging in tasks with large premise space. To address this, we propose LogicTree, an inference-time modular framework employing algorithm-guided search to automate structured proof exploration and ensure logical coherence. Advancing beyond tree-of-thought (ToT), we incorporate caching mechanism into LogicTree to enable effective utilization of historical knowledge, preventing reasoning stagnation and minimizing redundancy. Furthermore, we address the combinatorial complexity of premise search by decomposing it into a linear process. The refined premise selection restricts subsequent inference to at most one derivation per step, enhancing reasoning granularity and enforcing strict step-by-step reasoning. Additionally, we introduce two LLM-free heuristics for premise prioritization, enabling strategic proof search. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that LogicTree optimally scales inference-time computation to achieve higher proof accuracy, surpassing chain-of-thought (CoT) and ToT with average gains of 23.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on GPT-4o. Moreover, within LogicTree, GPT-4o outperforms o3-mini by 7.6% on average.

Abstract: This paper introduces WavesFM, a novel Wireless Foundation Model (WFM) framework, capable of supporting a wide array of communication, sensing, and localization tasks. Our proposed architecture combines a shared Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone with task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) heads and incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This design promotes full parameter sharing across tasks, significantly reducing the computational and memory footprint without sacrificing performance. The model processes both image-like wireless modalities, such as spectrograms and channel state information (CSI), and in-phase and quadrature (IQ) signals arranged as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) resource grids. We demonstrate the strong generalization capabilities of WavesFM through extensive experiments on four downstream tasks: Fifth Generation New Radio (5G NR) positioning; multiple-input multiple-output OFDM (MIMO-OFDM) channel estimation; human activity sensing; and radio-frequency (RF) signal classification. Compared to supervised baselines trained individually, our approach achieves superior performance while sharing 80% of its parameters across tasks. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on domain-relevant data not only boosts performance but also accelerates convergence, reducing training time by up to 5x. These results demonstrate that our unified WFM can support diverse tasks and deliver significant gains in both performance and efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of foundation models to drive AI-native paradigms in future sixth-generation (6G) networks.

Abstract: We investigate tasks that can be accomplished with unlabelled graphs, where nodes do not have persistent or semantically meaningful labels. New techniques to visualize these graphs have been proposed, but more understanding of unlabelled graph tasks is required before they can be adequately evaluated. Some tasks apply to both labelled and unlabelled graphs, but many do not translate between these contexts. We propose a taxonomy of unlabelled graph abstract tasks, organized according to the Scope of the data at play, the Action intended by the user, and the Target data under consideration. We show the descriptive power of this task abstraction by connecting to concrete examples from previous frameworks, and connect these abstractions to real-world problems. To showcase the evaluative power of the taxonomy, we perform a preliminary assessment of 6 visualizations for each task. For each combination of task and visual encoding, we consider the effort required from viewers, the likelihood of task success, and how both factors vary between small-scale and large-scale graphs.

Abstract: Determining the ideal architecture for deep learning models, such as the number of layers and neurons, is a difficult and resource-intensive process that frequently relies on human tuning or computationally costly optimization approaches. While Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been individually applied in optimization and deep learning, their combined use for enhancing convergence in numerical optimization tasks remains underexplored. Our work addresses this gap by integrating LLMs into PSO to reduce model evaluations and improve convergence for deep learning hyperparameter tuning. The proposed LLM-enhanced PSO method addresses the difficulties of efficiency and convergence by using LLMs (particularly ChatGPT-3.5 and Llama3) to improve PSO performance, allowing for faster achievement of target objectives. Our method speeds up search space exploration by substituting underperforming particle placements with best suggestions offered by LLMs. Comprehensive experiments across three scenarios -- (1) optimizing the Rastrigin function, (2) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series regression, and (3) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for material classification -- show that the method significantly improves convergence rates and lowers computational costs. Depending on the application, computational complexity is lowered by 20% to 60% compared to traditional PSO methods. Llama3 achieved a 20% to 40% reduction in model calls for regression tasks, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 reduced model calls by 60% for both regression and classification tasks, all while preserving accuracy and error rates. This groundbreaking methodology offers a very efficient and effective solution for optimizing deep learning models, leading to substantial computational performance improvements across a wide range of applications.

Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. We compare the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.

Abstract: High-fidelity simulation is essential for robotics research, enabling safe and efficient testing of perception, control, and navigation algorithms. However, achieving both photorealistic rendering and accurate physics modeling remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel simulation framework--the Unreal Robotics Lab (URL) that integrates the Unreal Engine's advanced rendering capabilities with MuJoCo's high-precision physics simulation. Our approach enables realistic robotic perception while maintaining accurate physical interactions, facilitating benchmarking and dataset generation for vision-based robotics applications. The system supports complex environmental effects, such as smoke, fire, and water dynamics, which are critical for evaluating robotic performance under adverse conditions. We benchmark visual navigation and SLAM methods within our framework, demonstrating its utility for testing real-world robustness in controlled yet diverse scenarios. By bridging the gap between physics accuracy and photorealistic rendering, our framework provides a powerful tool for advancing robotics research and sim-to-real transfer.

<title>Walk the Talk? Measuring the Faithfulness of Large Language Model Explanations</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating plausible explanations of how they arrived at an answer to a question. However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's "reasoning" process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.

<title>FGMP: Fine-Grained Mixed-Precision Weight and Activation Quantization for Hardware-Accelerated LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Quantization is a powerful tool to improve large language model (LLM) inference efficiency by utilizing more energy-efficient low-precision datapaths and reducing memory footprint. However, accurately quantizing LLM weights and activations to low precision is challenging without degrading model accuracy. We propose fine-grained mixed precision (FGMP) quantization, a post-training mixed-precision quantization hardware-software co-design methodology that maintains accuracy while quantizing the majority of weights and activations to reduced precision. Our work makes the following contributions: 1) We develop a policy that uses the perturbation in each value, weighted by the Fisher information, to select which weight and activation blocks to keep in higher precision. This approach preserves accuracy by identifying which weight and activation blocks need to be retained in higher precision to minimize the perturbation in the model loss. 2) We also propose a sensitivity-weighted clipping approach for fine-grained quantization which helps retain accuracy for blocks that are quantized to low precision. 3) We then propose hardware augmentations to leverage the efficiency benefits of FGMP quantization. Our hardware implementation encompasses i) datapath support for FGMP at block granularity, and ii) a mixed-precision activation quantization unit to assign activation blocks to high or low precision on the fly with minimal runtime and energy overhead. Our design, prototyped using NVFP4 (an FP4 format with microscaling) as the low-precision datatype and FP8 as the high-precision datatype, facilitates efficient FGMP quantization, attaining <1% perplexity degradation on Wikitext-103 for the Llama-2-7B model relative to an all-FP8 baseline design while consuming 14% less energy during inference and requiring 30% less weight memory.

<title>SConU: Selective Conformal Uncertainty in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly utilized in real-world applications, guarantees of task-specific metrics are essential for their reliable deployment. Previous studies have introduced various criteria of conformal uncertainty grounded in split conformal prediction, which offer user-specified correctness coverage. However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level. Our approach not only facilitates rigorous management of miscoverage rates across both single-domain and interdisciplinary contexts, but also enhances the efficiency of predictions. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the components of the conformal procedures, aiming to approximate conditional coverage, particularly in high-stakes question-answering tasks.

<title>DeepPD: Joint Phase and Object Estimation from Phase Diversity with Neural Calibration of a Deformable Mirror</title>

Abstract: Sample-induced aberrations and optical imperfections limit the resolution of fluorescence microscopy. Phase diversity is a powerful technique that leverages complementary phase information in sequentially acquired images with deliberately introduced aberrations--the phase diversities--to enable phase and object reconstruction and restore diffraction-limited resolution. These phase diversities are typically introduced into the optical path via a deformable mirror. Existing phase-diversity-based methods are limited to Zernike modes, require large numbers of diversity images, or depend on accurate mirror calibration--which are all suboptimal. We present DeepPD, a deep learning-based framework that combines neural representations of the object and wavefront with a learned model of the deformable mirror to jointly estimate both object and phase from only five images. DeepPD improves robustness and reconstruction quality over previous approaches, even under severe aberrations. We demonstrate its performance on calibration targets and biological samples, including immunolabeled myosin in fixed PtK2 cells.

<title>Learning over von Mises-Fisher Distributions via a Wasserstein-like Geometry</title>

Abstract: We introduce a novel, geometry-aware distance metric for the family of von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions, which are fundamental models for directional data on the unit hypersphere. Although the vMF distribution is widely employed in a variety of probabilistic learning tasks involving spherical data, principled tools for comparing vMF distributions remain limited, primarily due to the intractability of normalization constants and the absence of suitable geometric metrics. Motivated by the theory of optimal transport, we propose a Wasserstein-like distance that decomposes the discrepancy between two vMF distributions into two interpretable components: a geodesic term capturing the angular separation between mean directions, and a variance-like term quantifying differences in concentration parameters. The derivation leverages a Gaussian approximation in the high-concentration regime to yield a tractable, closed-form expression that respects the intrinsic spherical geometry. We show that the proposed distance exhibits desirable theoretical properties and induces a latent geometric structure on the space of non-degenerate vMF distributions. As a primary application, we develop the efficient algorithms for vMF mixture reduction, enabling structure-preserving compression of mixture models in high-dimensional settings. Empirical results on synthetic datasets and real-world high-dimensional embeddings, including biomedical sentence representations and deep visual features, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed geometry in distinguishing distributions and supporting interpretable inference. This work expands the statistical toolbox for directional data analysis by introducing a tractable, transport-inspired distance tailored to the geometry of the hypersphere.

<title>Rethinking Traffic Flow Forecasting: From Transition to Generatation</title>

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction plays an important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems in traffic management and urban planning. There have been extensive successful works in this area. However, these approaches focus only on modelling the flow transition and ignore the flow generation process, which manifests itself in two ways: (i) The models are based on Markovian assumptions, ignoring the multi-periodicity of the flow generation in nodes. (ii) The same structure is designed to encode both the transition and generation processes, ignoring the differences between them. To address these problems, we propose an Effective Multi-Branch Similarity Transformer for Traffic Flow Prediction, namely EMBSFormer. Through data analysis, we find that the factors affecting traffic flow include node-level traffic generation and graph-level traffic transition, which describe the multi-periodicity and interaction pattern of nodes, respectively. Specifically, to capture traffic generation patterns, we propose a similarity analysis module that supports multi-branch encoding to dynamically expand significant cycles. For traffic transition, we employ a temporal and spatial self-attention mechanism to maintain global node interactions, and use GNN and time conv to model local node interactions, respectively. Model performance is evaluated on three real-world datasets on both long-term and short-term prediction tasks. Experimental results show that EMBSFormer outperforms baselines on both tasks. Moreover, compared to models based on flow transition modelling (e.g. GMAN, 513k), the variant of EMBSFormer(93K) only uses 18\% of the parameters, achieving the same performance.

Abstract: As machine learning evolves, domain generalization (DG) and domain adaptation (DA) have become crucial for enhancing model robustness across diverse environments. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) plays a significant role in these tasks, offering powerful zero-shot capabilities that allow models to perform effectively in unseen domains. However, there remains a significant gap in the literature, as no comprehensive survey currently exists that systematically explores the applications of CLIP in DG and DA, highlighting the necessity for this review. This survey presents a comprehensive review of CLIP's applications in DG and DA. In DG, we categorize methods into optimizing prompt learning for task alignment and leveraging CLIP as a backbone for effective feature extraction, both enhancing model adaptability. For DA, we examine both source-available methods utilizing labeled source data and source-free approaches primarily based on target domain data, emphasizing knowledge transfer mechanisms and strategies for improved performance across diverse contexts. Key challenges, including overfitting, domain diversity, and computational efficiency, are addressed, alongside future research opportunities to advance robustness and efficiency in practical applications. By synthesizing existing literature and pinpointing critical gaps, this survey provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, proposing directions for effectively leveraging CLIP to enhance methodologies in domain generalization and adaptation. Ultimately, this work aims to foster innovation and collaboration in the quest for more resilient machine learning models that can perform reliably across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) plays a pivotal role in knowledge graph completion or question answering systems, providing richer and more accurate triples and attributes. As numerical attributes become increasingly essential in characterizing entities and relations in KGs, the ability to reason over these attributes has gained significant importance. Existing graph-based methods such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), primarily focus on aggregating homogeneous local neighbors and implicitly embedding diverse triples. However, these approaches often fail to fully leverage the potential of logical paths within the graph, limiting their effectiveness in exploiting the reasoning process. To address these limitations, we propose ChainsFormer, a novel chain-based framework designed to support numerical reasoning. Chainsformer not only explicitly constructs logical chains but also expands the reasoning depth to multiple hops. Specially, we introduces Relation-Attribute Chains (RA-Chains), a specialized logic chain, to model sequential reasoning patterns. ChainsFormer captures the step-by-step nature of multi-hop reasoning along RA-Chains by employing sequential in-context learning. To mitigate the impact of noisy chains, we propose a hyperbolic affinity scoring mechanism that selects relevant logic chains in a variable-resolution space. Furthermore, ChainsFormer incorporates an attention-based numerical reasoner to identify critical reasoning paths, enhancing both reasoning accuracy and transparency. Experimental results demonstrate that ChainsFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 20.0% improvement in performance. The implementations are available at https://github.com/zhaodazhuang2333/ChainsFormer.

Abstract: The recent successes of large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of theoretical research into language generation. A recent line of work proposes an abstract view, called language generation in the limit, where generation is seen as a game between an adversary and an algorithm: the adversary generates strings from an unknown language $K$, chosen from a countable collection of candidate languages, and after seeing a finite set of these strings, the algorithm must generate new strings from $K$ that it has not seen before. This formalism highlights a key tension: the trade-off between validity (the algorithm should only produce strings from the language) and breadth (it should be able to produce many strings from the language). This trade-off is central in applied language generation as well, where it appears as a balance between hallucination (generating invalid utterances) and mode collapse (generating only a restricted set of outputs). Despite its importance, this trade-off has been challenging to study quantitatively. We develop ways to quantify this trade-off by formalizing breadth using measures of density. Existing algorithms for language generation in the limit produce output sets that can have zero density in the true language, and this important failure of breadth might seem unavoidable. We show, however, that such a failure is not necessary: we provide an algorithm for language generation in the limit whose outputs have strictly positive density in $K$. We also study the internal representations built by these algorithms, specifically the sequence of hypothesized candidate languages they consider, and show that achieving the strongest form of breadth may require oscillating indefinitely between high- and low-density representations. Our analysis introduces a novel topology on language families, with notions of convergence and limit points playing a key role.

Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) is a burgeoning characterization technique that provides compositional mapping of materials in three-dimensions at near-atomic scale. Since its significant expansion in the past 30 years, we estimate that one million APT datasets have been collected, each containing millions to billions of individual ions. Their analysis and the extraction of microstructural information has largely relied upon individual users whose varied level of expertise causes clear and documented bias. Current practices hinder efficient data processing, and make challenging standardization and the deployment of data analysis workflows that would be compliant with FAIR data principles. Over the past decade, building upon the long-standing expertise of the APT community in the development of advanced data processing or data mining techniques, there has been a surge of novel machine learning (ML) approaches aiming for user-independence, and that are efficient, reproducible, and robust from a statistics perspective. Here, we provide a snapshot review of this rapidly evolving field. We begin with a brief introduction to APT and the nature of the APT data. This is followed by an overview of relevant ML algorithms and a comprehensive review of their applications to APT. We also discuss how ML can enable discoveries beyond human capability, offering new insights into the mechanisms within materials. Finally, we provide guidance for future directions in this domain.

Abstract: How do reasoning models verify their own answers? We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task. We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, resulting in a model that always produces highly structured and easily parse-able chain-of-thought sequences. With this setup, we do a top-down and bottom-up analysis to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs. Our top-down analysis reveals Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect'', which activate according to the correctness of the model's reasoning steps. Our bottom-up analysis reveals that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for model verification. Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU vectors to localize as few as three attention heads that can disable model verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit.

We first pre-train a neural acoustic field conditioned by room geometry on an external large-scale dataset in which pairs of RIRs and the geometries are provided. The neural acoustic field is then adapted to each target room by using the enrollment data, where we leverage either the provided room geometries or geometries retrieved from the external dataset, depending on availability. Lastly, we predict the RIRs for each pair of source and receiver locations specified by Task 1, and use these RIRs to train the speaker distance estimation model in Task 2.

Abstract: The increasingly challenging task of maintaining power grid security requires innovative solutions. Novel approaches using reinforcement learning (RL) agents have been proposed to help grid operators navigate the massive decision space and nonlinear behavior of these complex networks. However, applying RL to power grid security assessment, specifically for combinatorially troublesome contingency analysis problems, has proven difficult to scale. The integration of quantum computing into these RL frameworks helps scale by improving computational efficiency and boosting agent proficiency by leveraging quantum advantages in action exploration and model-based interdependence. To demonstrate a proof-of-concept use of quantum computing for RL agent training and simulation, we propose a hybrid agent that runs on quantum hardware using IBM's Qiskit Runtime. We also provide detailed insight into the construction of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for generating relevant quantum output. This agent's proficiency at maintaining grid stability is demonstrated relative to a benchmark model without quantum enhancement using N-k contingency analysis. Additionally, we offer a comparative assessment of the training procedures for RL models integrated with a quantum backend.

Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) offers a powerful and versatile approach to simulating diverse hydrodynamic phenomena, spanning microfluidics to aerodynamics. The vast range of spatiotemporal scales inherent in these systems currently renders full resolution impractical, necessitating the development of effective closure models for under-resolved simulations. Under-resolved LBMs are unstable, and while there is a number of important efforts to stabilize them, they often face limitations in generalizing across scales and physical systems. We present a novel, data-driven, multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that drastically improves stability and accuracy of coarse-grained LBM simulations. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network to dynamically control the local relaxation parameter for the LB across the simulation grid. The LB-MARL framework is showcased in turbulent Kolmogorov flows. We find that the MARL closures stabilize the simulations and recover the energy spectra of significantly more expensive fully resolved simulations while maintaining computational efficiency. The learned closure model can be transferred to flow scenarios unseen during training and has improved robustness and spectral accuracy compared to traditional LBM models. We believe that MARL closures open new frontiers for efficient and accurate simulations of a multitude of complex problems not accessible to present-day LB methods alone.

Abstract: Flow-based methods for sampling and generative modeling use continuous-time dynamical systems to represent a {transport map} that pushes forward a source measure to a target measure. The introduction of a time axis provides considerable design freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this freedom. Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero acceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved'' trajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning. In particular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given transport map $T$ and seek the schedule $\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ that minimizes the spatial Lipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t \in [0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation error when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad class of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \emph{optimal schedule} can be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal Lipschitz constant is \emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an identity schedule (corresponding to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic). Our proof technique relies on the calculus of variations and $\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the aforementioned degenerate objective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.

Abstract: Including children's images in datasets has raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, consent, data protection, and accountability. These datasets, often built by scraping publicly available images from the Internet, can expose children to risks such as exploitation, profiling, and tracking. Despite the growing recognition of these issues, approaches for addressing them remain limited. We explore the ethical implications of using children's images in AI datasets and propose a pipeline to detect and remove such images. As a use case, we built the pipeline on a Vision-Language Model under the Visual Question Answering task and tested it on the #PraCegoVer dataset. We also evaluate the pipeline on a subset of 100,000 images from the Open Images V7 dataset to assess its effectiveness in detecting and removing images of children. The pipeline serves as a baseline for future research, providing a starting point for more comprehensive tools and methodologies. While we leverage existing models trained on potentially problematic data, our goal is to expose and address this issue. We do not advocate for training or deploying such models, but instead call for urgent community reflection and action to protect children's rights. Ultimately, we aim to encourage the research community to exercise - more than an additional - care in creating new datasets and to inspire the development of tools to protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable groups, particularly children.

The resulting model achieves competitive predictive performance while yielding clear coefficients mapped onto psychological constructs, making it suitable for applications ranging from AI safety to economic policy analysis.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) can memorize and reproduce segments from their pretraining data verbatim even in non-adversarial settings, raising concerns about copyright, plagiarism, privacy, and creativity. We introduce Paraphrase Preference Optimization (ParaPO), a post-training method that fine-tunes LMs to reduce unintentional regurgitation while preserving their overall utility. ParaPO trains LMs to prefer paraphrased versions of memorized segments over the original verbatim content from the pretraining data. To maintain the ability to recall famous quotations when appropriate, we develop a variant of ParaPO that uses system prompts to control regurgitation behavior. In our evaluation on Llama3.1-8B, ParaPO consistently reduces regurgitation across all tested datasets (e.g., reducing the regurgitation metric from 17.3 to 12.9 in creative writing), whereas unlearning methods used in prior work to mitigate regurgitation are less effective outside their targeted unlearned domain (from 17.3 to 16.9). When applied to the instruction-tuned Tulu3-8B model, ParaPO with system prompting successfully preserves famous quotation recall while reducing unintentional regurgitation (from 8.7 to 6.3 in creative writing) when prompted not to regurgitate. In contrast, without ParaPO tuning, prompting the model not to regurgitate produces only a marginal reduction (8.7 to 8.4).

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique that enables observation of quantum states without direct measurement, preserving them for reuse. Our method allows multiple quantum states to be observed at different points within a single circuit, one at a time, and saved into classical memory without destruction. These saved states can be accessed on demand by downstream applications, introducing a dynamic and programmable notion of quantum memory that supports modular, non-destructive quantum workflows. We propose a hardware-agnostic, machine learning-driven framework to capture non-destructive estimates, or "snapshots," of quantum states at arbitrary points within a circuit, enabling classical storage and later reconstruction, similar to memory operations in classical computing. This capability is essential for debugging, introspection, and persistent memory in quantum systems, yet remains difficult due to the no-cloning theorem and destructive measurements. Our guess-and-check approach uses fidelity estimation via the SWAP test to guide state reconstruction. We explore both gradient-based deep neural networks and gradient-free evolutionary strategies to estimate quantum states using only fidelity as the learning signal. We demonstrate a key component of our framework on IBM quantum hardware, achieving high-fidelity (approximately 1.0) reconstructions for Hadamard and other known states. In simulation, our models achieve an average fidelity of 0.999 across 100 random quantum states. This provides a pathway toward non-volatile quantum memory, enabling long-term storage and reuse of quantum information, and laying groundwork for future quantum memory architectures.

Abstract: Interpreting neural activity through meaningful latent representations remains a complex and evolving challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We investigate the potential of multimodal foundation models to align invasive brain recordings with natural language. We present SSENSE, a contrastive learning framework that projects single-subject stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) signals into the sentence embedding space of a frozen CLIP model, enabling sentence-level retrieval directly from brain activity. SSENSE trains a neural encoder on spectral representations of sEEG using InfoNCE loss, without fine-tuning the text encoder. We evaluate our method on time-aligned sEEG and spoken transcripts from a naturalistic movie-watching dataset. Despite limited data, SSENSE achieves promising results, demonstrating that general-purpose language representations can serve as effective priors for neural decoding.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.

<title>Towards Model Resistant to Transferable Adversarial Examples via Trigger Activation</title>

Abstract: Adversarial examples, characterized by imperceptible perturbations, pose significant threats to deep neural networks by misleading their predictions. A critical aspect of these examples is their transferability, allowing them to deceive {unseen} models in black-box scenarios. Despite the widespread exploration of defense methods, including those on transferability, they show limitations: inefficient deployment, ineffective defense, and degraded performance on clean images. In this work, we introduce a novel training paradigm aimed at enhancing robustness against transferable adversarial examples (TAEs) in a more efficient and effective way. We propose a model that exhibits random guessing behavior when presented with clean data $\boldsymbol{x}$ as input, and generates accurate predictions when with triggered data $\boldsymbol{x}+\boldsymbol{\tau}$. Importantly, the trigger $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ remains constant for all data instances. We refer to these models as \textbf{models with trigger activation}. We are surprised to find that these models exhibit certain robustness against TAEs. Through the consideration of first-order gradients, we provide a theoretical analysis of this robustness. Moreover, through the joint optimization of the learnable trigger and the model, we achieve improved robustness to transferable attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse datasets, evaluating a variety of attacking methods, underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in various private and commercial applications, e.g. traffic control, package delivery, and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. Machine Learning (ML) methods used in UAV-assisted Sensor Networks (UASNETs) and especially in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) face challenges such as complex and lengthy model training, gaps between simulation and reality, and low sample efficiency, which conflict with the urgency of emergencies such as SAR operations. This paper proposes In-Context Learning (ICL)-based Data Collection Scheduling (ICLDC) scheme, as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The UAV collects and transmits logged sensory data, to an LLM, to generate a task description in natural language, from which it obtains a data collection schedule to be executed by the UAV. The system continuously adapts by adding feedback to task descriptions and utilizing feedback for future decisions. This method is tested against jailbreaking attacks, where task description is manipulated to undermine network performance, highlighting the vulnerability of LLMs to such attacks. The proposed ICLDC outperforms the Maximum Channel Gain by reducing cumulative packet loss by approximately 56\%. ICLDC presents a promising direction for intelligent scheduling and control in UAV-assisted data collection.

Abstract: The main approach to hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (QNN) is employing quantum computing to build a neural network (NN) that has quantum features, which is then optimized classically. Here, we propose a different strategy: to use quantum computing in order to optimize the weights of a classical NN. As such, we design an instance of Grover's quantum search algorithm to accelerate the search for the optimal parameters of an NN during the training process, a task traditionally performed using the backpropagation algorithm with the gradient descent method. Indeed, gradient descent has issues such as exploding gradient, vanishing gradient, or convexity problem. Other methods tried to address such issues with strategies like genetic searches, but they carry additional problems like convergence consistency. Our original method avoids these issues -- because it does not calculate gradients -- and capitalizes on classical architectures' robustness and Grover's quadratic speedup in high-dimensional search spaces to significantly reduce test loss (58.75%) and improve test accuracy (35.25%), compared to classical NN weight optimization, on small datasets. Unlike most QNNs that are trained on small datasets only, our method is also scalable, as it allows the optimization of deep networks; for an NN with 3 hidden layers, trained on the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, we obtained a mean accuracy of 97.7%. Moreover, our method requires a much smaller number of qubits compared to other QNN approaches, making it very practical for near-future quantum computers that will still deliver a limited number of logical qubits.

<title>Generalized Derangetropy Functionals for Modeling Cyclical Information Flow</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for modeling cyclical and feedback-driven information flow through a generalized family of entropy-modulated transformations called derangetropy functionals. Unlike scalar and static entropy measures such as Shannon entropy, these functionals act directly on probability densities and provide a topographical representation of information structure across the support of the distribution. The framework captures periodic and self-referential aspects of information distribution and encodes them through functional operators governed by nonlinear differential equations. When applied recursively, these operators induce a spectral diffusion process governed by the heat equation, leading to convergence toward a Gaussian characteristic function. This convergence theorem provides a unified analytical foundation for describing the long-term dynamics of information under cyclic modulation. The proposed framework offers new tools for analyzing the temporal evolution of information in systems characterized by periodic structure, stochastic feedback, and delayed interaction, with applications in artificial neural networks, communication theory, and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

Abstract: Real-world \underline{F}ederated \underline{L}earning systems often encounter \underline{D}ynamic clients with \underline{A}gnostic and highly heterogeneous data distributions (DAFL), which pose challenges for efficient communication and model initialization. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from the recently proposed Learngene paradigm, which compresses the large-scale model into lightweight, cross-task meta-information fragments. Learngene effectively encapsulates and communicates core knowledge, making it particularly well-suited for DAFL, where dynamic client participation requires communication efficiency and rapid adaptation to new data distributions. Based on this insight, we propose a Gene-driven parameter-efficient dynamic Federated Learning (GENE-FL) framework. First, local models perform quadratic constraints based on parameters with high Fisher values in the global model, as these parameters are considered to encapsulate generalizable knowledge. Second, we apply the strategy of parameter sensitivity analysis in local model parameters to condense the \textit{learnGene} for interaction. Finally, the server aggregates these small-scale trained \textit{learnGene}s into a robust \textit{learnGene} with cross-task generalization capability, facilitating the rapid initialization of dynamic agnostic client models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GENE-FL reduces \textbf{4 $\times$} communication costs compared to FEDAVG and effectively initializes agnostic client models with only about \textbf{9.04} MB.

Abstract: Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer a valuable opportunity to create privacy preserving and harmonized structured data, supporting numerous applications in healthcare. Key benefits of synthetic data include precise control over the data schema, improved fairness and representation of patient populations, and the ability to share datasets without concerns about compromising real individuals privacy. Consequently, the AI community has increasingly turned to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data across various domains. However, a significant challenge in healthcare is ensuring that synthetic health records reliably generalize across different hospitals, a long standing issue in the field. In this work, we evaluate the current state of commercial LLMs for generating synthetic data and investigate multiple aspects of the generation process to identify areas where these models excel and where they fall short. Our main finding from this work is that while LLMs can reliably generate synthetic health records for smaller subsets of features, they struggle to preserve realistic distributions and correlations as the dimensionality of the data increases, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize across diverse hospital settings.

Abstract: Mobile network operators (MNOs) manage Radio Access Networks (RANs) with massive amounts of cells over multiple radio generations (2G-5G). To handle such complexity, operations teams rely on monitoring systems, including anomaly detection tools that identify unexpected behaviors. In this paper, we present c-ANEMON, a Contextual ANomaly dEtection MONitor for the RAN based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our solution captures spatio-temporal variations by analyzing the behavior of individual cells in relation to their local neighborhoods, enabling the detection of anomalies that are independent of external mobility factors. This, in turn, allows focusing on anomalies associated with network issues (e.g., misconfigurations, equipment failures). We evaluate c-ANEMON using real-world data from a large European metropolitan area (7,890 cells; 3 months). First, we show that the GNN model within our solution generalizes effectively to cells from previously unseen areas, suggesting the possibility of using a single model across extensive deployment regions. Then, we analyze the anomalies detected by c-ANEMON through manual inspection and define several categories of long-lasting anomalies (6+ hours). Notably, 45.95% of these anomalies fall into a category that is more likely to require intervention by operations teams.

Abstract: We introduce a differentially private (DP) algorithm called reveal-or-obscure (ROO) to generate a single representative sample from a dataset of $n$ observations drawn i.i.d. from an unknown discrete distribution $P$. Unlike methods that add explicit noise to the estimated empirical distribution, ROO achieves $\epsilon$-differential privacy by randomly choosing whether to "reveal" or "obscure" the empirical distribution. While ROO is structurally identical to Algorithm 1 proposed by Cheu and Nayak (arXiv:2412.10512), we prove a strictly better bound on the sampling complexity than that established in Theorem 12 of (arXiv:2412.10512). To further improve the privacy-utility trade-off, we propose a novel generalized sampling algorithm called Data-Specific ROO (DS-ROO), where the probability of obscuring the empirical distribution of the dataset is chosen adaptively. We prove that DS-ROO satisfies $\epsilon$-DP, and provide empirical evidence that DS-ROO can achieve better utility under the same privacy budget of vanilla ROO.

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) based hand gesture recognition converts forearm muscle activity into control commands for prosthetics, rehabilitation, and human computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to EMG-based hand gesture recognition that uses fine-grained classification and presents XMANet, which unifies low-level local and high level semantic cues through cross layer mutual attention among shallow to deep CNN experts. Using stacked spectrograms and scalograms derived from the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform (WT), we benchmark XMANet against ResNet50, DenseNet-121, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetB0. Experimental results on the Grabmyo dataset indicate that, using STFT, the proposed XMANet model outperforms the baseline ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV3, and DenseNet121 models with improvement of approximately 1.72%, 4.38%, 5.10%, and 2.53%, respectively. When employing the WT approach, improvements of around 1.57%, 1.88%, 1.46%, and 2.05% are observed over the same baselines. Similarly, on the FORS EMG dataset, the XMANet(ResNet50) model using STFT shows an improvement of about 5.04% over the baseline ResNet50. In comparison, the XMANet(DenseNet121) and XMANet(MobileNetV3) models yield enhancements of approximately 4.11% and 2.81%, respectively. Moreover, when using WT, the proposed XMANet achieves gains of around 4.26%, 9.36%, 5.72%, and 6.09% over the baseline ResNet50, DenseNet121, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetB0 models, respectively. These results confirm that XMANet consistently improves performance across various architectures and signal processing techniques, demonstrating the strong potential of fine grained features for accurate and robust EMG classification.

Abstract: We introduce TAPIP3D, a novel approach for long-term 3D point tracking in monocular RGB and RGB-D videos. TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera motion is effectively canceled. TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame 3D motion estimates within this stabilized representation, enabling robust tracking over extended periods. To manage the inherent irregularities of 3D point distributions, we propose a Local Pair Attention mechanism. This 3D contextualization strategy effectively exploits spatial relationships in 3D, forming informative feature neighborhoods for precise 3D trajectory estimation. Our 3D-centric approach significantly outperforms existing 3D point tracking methods and even enhances 2D tracking accuracy compared to conventional 2D pixel trackers when accurate depth is available. It supports inference in both camera coordinates (i.e., unstabilized) and world coordinates, and our results demonstrate that compensating for camera motion improves tracking performance. Our approach replaces the conventional 2D square correlation neighborhoods used in prior 2D and 3D trackers, leading to more robust and accurate results across various 3D point tracking benchmarks.

Abstract: Instant Messaging-Based Video Call Applications (IMVCAs) and Video Conferencing Applications (VCAs) have become integral to modern communication. Ensuring a high Quality of Experience (QoE) for users in this context is critical for network operators, as network conditions significantly impact user QoE. However, network operators lack access to end-device QoE metrics due to encrypted traffic. Existing solutions estimate QoE metrics from encrypted traffic traversing the network, with the most advanced approaches leveraging machine learning models. Subsequently, the need for ground truth QoE metrics for training and validation poses a challenge, as not all video applications provide these metrics. To address this challenge, we propose an application-agnostic approach for objective QoE estimation from encrypted traffic. Independent of the video application, we obtained key video QoE metrics, enabling broad applicability to various proprietary IMVCAs and VCAs. To validate our solution, we created a diverse dataset from WhatsApp video sessions under various network conditions, comprising 25,680 seconds of traffic data and QoE metrics. Our evaluation shows high performance across the entire dataset, with 85.2% accuracy for FPS predictions within an error margin of two FPS, and 90.2% accuracy for PIQE-based quality rating classification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the tunability of the Random Survival Forest (RSF) model in predictive maintenance, where accurate time-to-failure estimation is crucial. Although RSF is widely used due to its flexibility and ability to handle censored data, its performance is sensitive to hyperparameter configurations. However, systematic evaluations of RSF tunability remain limited, especially in predictive maintenance contexts. We introduce a three-level framework to quantify tunability: (1) a model-level metric measuring overall performance gain from tuning, (2) a hyperparameter-level metric assessing individual contributions, and (3) identification of optimal tuning ranges. These metrics are evaluated across multiple datasets using survival-specific criteria: the C-index for discrimination and the Brier score for calibration. Experiments on four CMAPSS dataset subsets, simulating aircraft engine degradation, reveal that hyperparameter tuning consistently improves model performance. On average, the C-index increased by 0.0547, while the Brier score decreased by 0.0199. These gains were consistent across all subsets. Moreover, ntree and mtry showed the highest average tunability, while nodesize offered stable improvements within the range of 10 to 30. In contrast, splitrule demonstrated negative tunability on average, indicating that improper tuning may reduce model performance. Our findings emphasize the practical importance of hyperparameter tuning in survival models and provide actionable insights for optimizing RSF in real-world predictive maintenance applications.

Abstract: The exponential growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to highlight the need for efficient strategies to meet ever-expanding computational and data demands. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of two complementary paradigms: Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Dataset Distillation (DD), both aimed at compressing LLMs while preserving their advanced reasoning capabilities and linguistic diversity. We first examine key methodologies in KD, such as task-specific alignment, rationale-based training, and multi-teacher frameworks, alongside DD techniques that synthesize compact, high-impact datasets through optimization-based gradient matching, latent space regularization, and generative synthesis. Building on these foundations, we explore how integrating KD and DD can produce more effective and scalable compression strategies. Together, these approaches address persistent challenges in model scalability, architectural heterogeneity, and the preservation of emergent LLM abilities. We further highlight applications across domains such as healthcare and education, where distillation enables efficient deployment without sacrificing performance. Despite substantial progress, open challenges remain in preserving emergent reasoning and linguistic diversity, enabling efficient adaptation to continually evolving teacher models and datasets, and establishing comprehensive evaluation protocols. By synthesizing methodological innovations, theoretical foundations, and practical insights, our survey charts a path toward sustainable, resource-efficient LLMs through the tighter integration of KD and DD principles.

Abstract: Planning is central to agents and agentic AI. The ability to plan, e.g., creating travel itineraries within a budget, holds immense potential in both scientific and commercial contexts. Moreover, optimal plans tend to require fewer resources compared to ad-hoc methods. To date, a comprehensive understanding of existing planning benchmarks appears to be lacking. Without it, comparing planning algorithms' performance across domains or selecting suitable algorithms for new scenarios remains challenging.

Abstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels. Code is available at https://github.com/pfnet-research/Bayesian_SpatialCorr.

Abstract: A driver face monitoring system can detect driver fatigue, which is a significant factor in many accidents, using computer vision techniques. In this paper, we present a real-time technique for driver eye state detection. First, the face is detected, and the eyes are located within the face region for tracking. A normalized cross-correlation-based online dynamic template matching technique, combined with Kalman filter tracking, is proposed to track the detected eye positions in subsequent image frames. A support vector machine with histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features is used to classify the state of the eyes as open or closed. If the eyes remain closed for a specified period, the driver is considered to be asleep, and an alarm is triggered.

Abstract: This article introduces a novel and fast method for refining pre-trained static word or, more generally, token embeddings. By incorporating the embeddings of neighboring tokens in text corpora, it continuously updates the representation of each token, including those without pre-assigned embeddings. This approach effectively addresses the out-of-vocabulary problem, too. Operating independently of large language models and shallow neural networks, it enables versatile applications such as corpus exploration, conceptual search, and word sense disambiguation. The method is designed to enhance token representations within topically homogeneous corpora, where the vocabulary is restricted to a specific domain, resulting in more meaningful embeddings compared to general-purpose pre-trained vectors. As an example, the methodology is applied to explore storm events and their impacts on infrastructure and communities using narratives from a subset of the NOAA Storm Events database. The article also demonstrates how the approach improves the representation of storm-related terms over time, providing valuable insights into the evolving nature of disaster narratives.

<title>DONOD: Robust and Generalizable Instruction Fine-Tuning for LLMs via Model-Intrinsic Dataset Pruning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14810</link>

Abstract: Ad-hoc instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) is widely adopted for domain-specific adaptation. While domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is effective and efficient, it often weakens cross-domain generalization and struggles with noisy training data. To address these challenges, we propose DONOD, a lightweight model-intrinsic data pruning method. Our approach evaluates data using two model-parameter-based metrics: Delta of Norm (DON), which captures the cumulative influence on model weights, and Norm of Delta (NOD), which quantifies weight instability. Moreover, by employing the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm, we effectively filter noisy, unlearnable, and generalization-harming samples without relying on auxiliary models during the SFT process. Experiments on mathematical tasks demonstrate that data selected by DONOD achieve superior fine-tuning efficiency and improved robustness against noisy data. By filtering out 70% of the full dataset, we improve target-domain accuracy by 14.90% and cross-domain accuracy by 5.67%. Meanwhile, our selected data present superior cross-architecture generalization. Data pruned by smaller models (e.g., Llama 3.1-8B) generalize effectively on larger models (e.g., Llama 2-13B). Compared to existing related methodologies, DONOD demonstrates comparable or superior performance while remaining dataset-agnostic, enabling broader applicability.

<title>ReSpec: Relevance and Specificity Grounded Online Filtering for Learning on Video-Text Data Streams</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of video-text data presents challenges in storage and computation during training. Online learning, which processes streaming data in real-time, offers a promising solution to these issues while also allowing swift adaptations in scenarios demanding real-time responsiveness. One strategy to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of learning involves identifying and prioritizing data that enhances performance on target downstream tasks. We propose Relevance and Specificity-based online filtering framework (ReSpec) that selects data based on four criteria: (i) modality alignment for clean data, (ii) task relevance for target focused data, (iii) specificity for informative and detailed data, and (iv) efficiency for low-latency processing. Relevance is determined by the probabilistic alignment of incoming data with downstream tasks, while specificity employs the distance to a root embedding representing the least specific data as an efficient proxy for informativeness. By establishing reference points from target task data, ReSpec filters incoming data in real-time, eliminating the need for extensive storage and compute. Evaluating on large-scale datasets WebVid2M and VideoCC3M, ReSpec attains state-of-the-art performance on five zeroshot video retrieval tasks, using as little as 5% of the data while incurring minimal compute. The source code is available at https://github.com/cdjkim/ReSpec.

<title>Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, offers such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives like ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization has remained a major obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle, by casting planning itself as variational inference. Our formulation yields optimal policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.

<title>Integrating Response Time and Attention Duration in Bayesian Preference Learning for Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding</title>

Abstract: We introduce a multiple criteria Bayesian preference learning framework incorporating behavioral cues for decision aiding. The framework integrates pairwise comparisons, response time, and attention duration to deepen insights into decision-making processes. The approach employs an additive value function model and utilizes a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior distribution of potential ranking models by defining the likelihood of observed preference data and specifying a prior on the preference structure. This distribution highlights each model's ability to reconstruct Decision-Makers' holistic pairwise comparisons. By leveraging both response time as a proxy for cognitive effort and alternative discriminability as well as attention duration as an indicator of criterion importance, the proposed model surpasses traditional methods by uncovering richer behavioral patterns. We report the results of a laboratory experiment on mobile phone contract selection involving 30 real subjects using a dedicated application with time-, eye-, and mouse-tracking components. We validate the novel method's ability to reconstruct complete preferences. The detailed ablation studies reveal time- and attention-related behavioral patterns, confirming that integrating comprehensive data leads to developing models that better align with the DM's actual preferences.

Abstract: Speaker identification using voice recordings leverages unique acoustic features, but this approach fails when only textual data is available. Few approaches have attempted to tackle the problem of identifying speakers solely from text, and the existing ones have primarily relied on traditional methods. In this work, we explore the use of fuzzy fingerprints from large pre-trained models to improve text-based speaker identification. We integrate speaker-specific tokens and context-aware modeling, demonstrating that conversational context significantly boosts accuracy, reaching 70.6% on the Friends dataset and 67.7% on the Big Bang Theory dataset. Additionally, we show that fuzzy fingerprints can approximate full fine-tuning performance with fewer hidden units, offering improved interpretability. Finally, we analyze ambiguous utterances and propose a mechanism to detect speaker-agnostic lines. Our findings highlight key challenges and provide insights for future improvements in text-based speaker identification.

<title>Trainable Quantum Neural Network for Multiclass Image Classification with the Power of Pre-trained Tree Tensor Networks</title>

Abstract: Tree tensor networks (TTNs) offer powerful models for image classification. While these TTN image classifiers already show excellent performance on classical hardware, embedding them into quantum neural networks (QNNs) may further improve the performance by leveraging quantum resources. However, embedding TTN classifiers into QNNs for multiclass classification remains challenging. Key obstacles are the highorder gate operations required for large bond dimensions and the mid-circuit postselection with exponentially low success rates necessary for the exact embedding. In this work, to address these challenges, we propose forest tensor network (FTN)-classifiers, which aggregate multiple small-bond-dimension TTNs. This allows us to handle multiclass classification without requiring large gates in the embedded circuits. We then remove the overhead of mid-circuit postselection by extending the adiabatic encoding framework to our setting and smoothly encode the FTN-classifiers into a quantum forest tensor network (qFTN)- classifiers. Numerical experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that we can successfully train FTN-classifiers and encode them into qFTN-classifiers, while maintaining or even improving the performance of the pre-trained FTN-classifiers. These results suggest that synergy between TTN classification models and QNNs can provide a robust and scalable framework for multiclass quantum-enhanced image classification.

Abstract: Making it intelligent is a promising way in System/OS design. This paper proposes OSML+, a new ML-based resource scheduling mechanism for co-located cloud services. OSML+ intelligently schedules the cache and main memory bandwidth resources at the memory hierarchy and the computing core resources simultaneously. OSML+ uses a multi-model collaborative learning approach during its scheduling and thus can handle complicated cases, e.g., avoiding resource cliffs, sharing resources among applications, enabling different scheduling policies for applications with different priorities, etc. OSML+ can converge faster using ML models than previous studies. Moreover, OSML+ can automatically learn on the fly and handle dynamically changing workloads accordingly. Using transfer learning technologies, we show our design can work well across various cloud servers, including the latest off-the-shelf large-scale servers. Our experimental results show that OSML+ supports higher loads and meets QoS targets with lower overheads than previous studies.

<title>Mitigating Degree Bias in Graph Representation Learning with Learnable Structural Augmentation and Structural Self-Attention</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) update node representations through message passing, which is primarily based on the homophily principle, assuming that adjacent nodes share similar features. However, in real-world graphs with long-tailed degree distributions, high-degree nodes dominate message passing, causing a degree bias where low-degree nodes remain under-represented due to inadequate messages. The main challenge in addressing degree bias is how to discover non-adjacent nodes to provide additional messages to low-degree nodes while reducing excessive messages for high-degree nodes. Nevertheless, exploiting non-adjacent nodes to provide valuable messages is challenging, as it could generate noisy information and disrupt the original graph structures. To solve it, we propose a novel Degree Fairness Graph Transformer, named DegFairGT, to mitigate degree bias by discovering structural similarities between non-adjacent nodes through learnable structural augmentation and structural self-attention. Our key idea is to exploit non-adjacent nodes with similar roles in the same community to generate informative edges under our augmentation, which could provide informative messages between nodes with similar roles while ensuring that the homophily principle is maintained within the community. To enable DegFairGT to learn such structural similarities, we then propose a structural self-attention to capture the similarities between node pairs. To preserve global graph structures and prevent graph augmentation from hindering graph structure, we propose a Self-Supervised Learning task to preserve p-step transition probability and regularize graph augmentation. Extensive experiments on six datasets showed that DegFairGT outperformed state-of-the-art baselines in degree fairness analysis, node classification, and node clustering tasks.

Abstract: Detecting collaborative and problem-solving behaviours from digital traces to interpret students' collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency is a long-term goal in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) field. Although multimodal data and advanced models are argued to have the potential to detect complex CPS behaviours, empirical evidence on their value remains limited with some contrasting evidence. In this study, we investigated the potential of multimodal data to improve model performance in diagnosing 78 secondary school students' CPS subskills and indicators in authentic educational settings. In particular, text embeddings from verbal data and acoustic embeddings from audio data were used in a multimodal classification model for CPS diagnosis. Both unimodal and multimodal transformer-based models outperformed traditional models in detecting CPS classes. Although the inclusion of multimodality did not improve the performance of traditional unimodal models, its integration into transformer-based models demonstrated improved performance for diagnosing social-cognitive CPS classes compared to unimodal transformer-based models. Based on the results, the paper argues that multimodality and the selection of a particular modelling technique should not be taken for granted to achieve the best performance in the automated detection of every CPS subskill and indicator. Rather, their value is limited to certain types of CPS indicators, affected by the complexity of the labels, and dependent on the composition of indicators in the dataset. We conclude the paper by discussing the required nuance when considering the value of LLMs and multimodality in automated CPS diagnosis, highlighting the need for human-AI complementarity, and proposing the exploration of relevant model architectures and techniques to improve CPS diagnosis in authentic educational contexts.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the capabilities of several methods for analyzing the sensitivity of neural networks to perturbations of the input data and interpreting their underlying mechanisms. The investigated approaches include the Sobol global sensitivity analysis, the local sensitivity method for input pixel perturbations and the activation maximization technique. As examples, in this study we consider a small feedforward neural network for analyzing an open tabular dataset of clinical diabetes data, as well as two classical convolutional architectures, VGG-16 and ResNet-18, which are widely used in image processing and classification. Utilization of the global sensitivity analysis allows us to identify the leading input parameters of the chosen tiny neural network and reduce their number without significant loss of the accuracy. As far as global sensitivity analysis is not applicable to larger models we try the local sensitivity analysis and activation maximization method in application to the convolutional neural networks. These methods show interesting patterns for the convolutional models solving the image classification problem. All in all, we compare the results of the activation maximization method with popular Grad-CAM technique in the context of ultrasound data analysis.

Abstract: Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment, flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world perturbations.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction.

Abstract: Two major tasks in applications of hidden Markov models are to (i) compute distributions of summary statistics of the hidden state sequence, and (ii) decode the hidden state sequence. We describe finite Markov chain imbedding (FMCI) and hybrid decoding to solve each of these two tasks. In the first part of our paper we use FMCI to compute posterior distributions of summary statistics such as the number of visits to a hidden state, the total time spent in a hidden state, the dwell time in a hidden state, and the longest run length. We use simulations from the hidden state sequence, conditional on the observed sequence, to establish the FMCI framework. In the second part of our paper we apply hybrid segmentation for improved decoding of a HMM. We demonstrate that hybrid decoding shows increased performance compared to Viterbi or Posterior decoding (often also referred to as global or local decoding), and we introduce a novel procedure for choosing the tuning parameter in the hybrid procedure. Furthermore, we provide an alternative derivation of the hybrid loss function based on weighted geometric means. We demonstrate and apply FMCI and hybrid decoding on various classical data sets, and supply accompanying code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Automated diagnosis of eczema using images acquired from digital camera can enable individuals to self-monitor their recovery. The process entails first segmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity of eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated eczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the severity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated data to train which can be hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for automated eczema diagnosis under limited training data regime. Our framework consists of two stages: i) Segmentation, where we use an in-context learning based algorithm called SegGPT for few-shot segmentation of eczema region from the image; ii) Feature extraction and classification, where we extract DINO features from the segmented regions and feed it to a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for 4-class classification of eczema severity. When evaluated on a dataset of annotated "in-the-wild" eczema images, we show that our method outperforms (Weighted F1: 0.67 $\pm$ 0.01) the state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as finetuned Resnet-18 (Weighted F1: 0.44 $\pm$ 0.16) and Vision Transformer (Weighted F1: 0.40 $\pm$ 0.22). Our results show that self-supervised learning can be a viable solution for automated skin diagnosis where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: MILS (Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver) is a recently published framework that claims "LLMs can see and hear without any training" by leveraging an iterative, LLM-CLIP based approach for zero-shot image captioning. While this MILS approach demonstrates good performance, our investigation reveals that this success comes at a hidden, substantial computational cost due to its expensive multi-step refinement process. In contrast, alternative models such as BLIP-2 and GPT-4V achieve competitive results through a streamlined, single-pass approach. We hypothesize that the significant overhead inherent in MILS's iterative process may undermine its practical benefits, thereby challenging the narrative that zero-shot performance can be attained without incurring heavy resource demands. This work is the first to expose and quantify the trade-offs between output quality and computational cost in MILS, providing critical insights for the design of more efficient multimodal models.

Abstract: We present Distributional RewArds for Generative OptimizatioN (DRAGON), a versatile framework for fine-tuning media generation models towards a desired outcome. Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations. As such, DRAGON exhibits a new approach to designing and optimizing reward functions for improving human-perceived quality. Sound examples at https://ml-dragon.github.io/web.

<title>Fully Bayesian Approaches to Topics over Time</title>

Abstract: The Topics over Time (ToT) model captures thematic changes in timestamped datasets by explicitly modeling publication dates jointly with word co-occurrence patterns. However, ToT was not approached in a fully Bayesian fashion, a flaw that makes it susceptible to stability problems. To address this issue, we propose a fully Bayesian Topics over Time (BToT) model via the introduction of a conjugate prior to the Beta distribution. This prior acts as a regularization that prevents the online version of the algorithm from unstable updates when a topic is poorly represented in a mini-batch. The characteristics of this prior to the Beta distribution are studied here for the first time. Still, this model suffers from a difference in scale between the single-time observations and the multiplicity of words per document. A variation of BToT, Weighted Bayesian Topics over Time (WBToT), is proposed as a solution. In WBToT, publication dates are repeated a certain number of times per document, which balances the relative influence of words and timestamps along the inference process. We have tested our models on two datasets: a collection of over 200 years of US state-of-the-union (SOTU) addresses and a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter corpus of 10 million tweets. The results show that WBToT captures events better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation and other SOTA topic models like BERTopic: the median absolute deviation of the topic presence over time is reduced by $51\%$ and $34\%$, respectively. Our experiments also demonstrate the superior coherence of WBToT over BToT, which highlights the importance of balancing the time and word modalities. Finally, we illustrate the stability of the online optimization algorithm in WBToT, which allows the application of WBToT to problems that are intractable for standard ToT.

<title>Values in the Wild: Discovering and Analyzing Values in Real-World Language Model Interactions</title>

Abstract: AI assistants can impart value judgments that shape people's decisions and worldviews, yet little is known empirically about what values these systems rely on in practice. To address this, we develop a bottom-up, privacy-preserving method to extract the values (normative considerations stated or demonstrated in model responses) that Claude 3 and 3.5 models exhibit in hundreds of thousands of real-world interactions. We empirically discover and taxonomize 3,307 AI values and study how they vary by context. We find that Claude expresses many practical and epistemic values, and typically supports prosocial human values while resisting values like "moral nihilism". While some values appear consistently across contexts (e.g. "transparency"), many are more specialized and context-dependent, reflecting the diversity of human interlocutors and their varied contexts. For example, "harm prevention" emerges when Claude resists users, "historical accuracy" when responding to queries about controversial events, "healthy boundaries" when asked for relationship advice, and "human agency" in technology ethics discussions. By providing the first large-scale empirical mapping of AI values in deployment, our work creates a foundation for more grounded evaluation and design of values in AI systems.

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation, or affording a generator large language model (LLM) extra compute during inference, typically employs the help of external non-generative evaluators (i.e., reward models). Concurrently, LLM-judges, models trained to generate evaluations and critiques (explanations) in natural language, are becoming increasingly popular in automatic evaluation. Despite judge empirical successes, their effectiveness as evaluators in test-time scaling settings is largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce the Judge Evaluation for Test-Time Scaling (JETTS) benchmark, which evaluates judge performance in three domains (math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following) under three task settings: response reranking, step-level beam search, and critique-based response refinement. We evaluate 10 different judge models (7B-70B parameters) for 8 different base generator models (6.7B-72B parameters). Our benchmark shows that while judges are competitive with outcome reward models in reranking, they are consistently worse than process reward models in beam search procedures. Furthermore, though unique to LLM-judges, their natural language critiques are currently ineffective in guiding the generator towards better responses.

Abstract: Objective: Healthcare data fragmentation presents a major challenge for linking patient data, necessitating robust record linkage to integrate patient records from diverse sources. This study investigates the feasibility of leveraging language models for automated patient record linkage, focusing on two key tasks: blocking and matching. Materials and Methods: We utilized real-world healthcare data from the Missouri Cancer Registry and Research Center, linking patient records from two independent sources using probabilistic linkage as a baseline. A transformer-based model, RoBERTa, was fine-tuned for blocking using sentence embeddings. For matching, several language models were experimented under fine-tuned and zero-shot settings, assessing their performance against ground truth labels. Results: The fine-tuned blocking model achieved a 92% reduction in the number of candidate pairs while maintaining near-perfect recall. In the matching task, fine-tuned Mistral-7B achieved the best performance with only 6 incorrect predictions. Among zero-shot models, Mistral-Small-24B performed best, with a total of 55 incorrect predictions. Discussion: Fine-tuned language models achieved strong performance in patient record blocking and matching with minimal errors. However, they remain less accurate and efficient than a hybrid rule-based and probabilistic approach for blocking. Additionally, reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 are impractical for large-scale record linkage due to high computational costs. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of language models for automating patient record linkage, offering improved efficiency by eliminating the manual efforts required to perform patient record linkage. Overall, language models offer a scalable solution that can enhance data integration, reduce manual effort, and support disease surveillance and research.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have proven effective for test-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. However, reward hacking issues with PRMs limit their successful application in reinforcement fine-tuning. In this paper, we identify the main cause of PRM-induced reward hacking: the canonical summation-form credit assignment in reinforcement learning (RL), which defines the value as cumulative gamma-decayed future rewards, easily induces LLMs to hack steps with high rewards. To address this, we propose PURE: Process sUpervised Reinforcement lEarning. The key innovation of PURE is a min-form credit assignment that formulates the value function as the minimum of future rewards. This method significantly alleviates reward hacking by limiting the value function range and distributing advantages more reasonably. Through extensive experiments on 3 base models, we show that PRM-based approaches enabling min-form credit assignment achieve comparable reasoning performance to verifiable reward-based methods within only 30% steps. In contrast, the canonical sum-form credit assignment collapses training even at the beginning! Additionally, when we supplement PRM-based fine-tuning with just 10% verifiable rewards, we further alleviate reward hacking and produce the best fine-tuned model based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B in our experiments, achieving 82.5% accuracy on AMC23 and 53.3% average accuracy across 5 benchmarks. Moreover, we summarize the observed reward hacking cases and analyze the causes of training collapse. Code and models are available at https://github.com/CJReinforce/PURE.

Abstract: This book is devoted to the problem of sequential probability forecasting, that is, predicting the probabilities of the next outcome of a growing sequence of observations given the past. This problem is considered in a very general setting that unifies commonly used probabilistic and non-probabilistic settings, trying to make as few as possible assumptions on the mechanism generating the observations. A common form that arises in various formulations of this problem is that of mixture predictors, which are formed as a combination of a finite or infinite set of other predictors attempting to combine their predictive powers. The main subject of this book are such mixture predictors, and the main results demonstrate the universality of this method in a very general probabilistic setting, but also show some of its limitations. While the problems considered are motivated by practical applications, involving, for example, financial, biological or behavioural data, this motivation is left implicit and all the results exposed are theoretical.
  The book targets graduate students and researchers interested in the problem of sequential prediction, and, more generally, in theoretical analysis of problems in machine learning and non-parametric statistics, as well as mathematical and philosophical foundations of these fields.
  The material in this volume is presented in a way that presumes familiarity with basic concepts of probability and statistics, up to and including probability distributions over spaces of infinite sequences. Familiarity with the literature on learning or stochastic processes is not required.

Abstract: In recent years, representation learning has become the research focus of the machine learning community. Large-scale neural networks are a crucial step toward achieving general intelligence, with their success largely attributed to their ability to learn abstract representations of data. Several learning fields are actively discussing how to learn representations, yet there is a lack of a unified perspective. We convert the representation learning problem under different tasks into a ranking problem. By adopting the ranking problem as a unified perspective, representation learning tasks can be solved in a unified manner by optimizing the ranking loss. Experiments under various learning tasks, such as classification, retrieval, multi-label learning, and regression, prove the superiority of the representation learning by ranking framework. Furthermore, experiments under self-supervised learning tasks demonstrate the significant advantage of the ranking framework in processing unsupervised training data, with data augmentation techniques further enhancing its performance.

Abstract: As interpretability gains attention in machine learning, there is a growing need for reliable models that fully explain representation content. We propose a mutual information (MI)-based method that decomposes neural network representations into three exhaustive components: total mutual information, decision-related information, and redundant information. This theoretically complete framework captures the entire input-representation relationship, surpassing partial explanations like those from Grad-CAM. Using two lightweight modules integrated into architectures such as CNNs and Transformers,we estimate these components and demonstrate their interpretive power through visualizations on ResNet and prototype network applied to image classification and few-shot learning tasks. Our approach is distinguished by three key features: 1. Rooted in mutual information theory, it delivers a thorough and theoretically grounded interpretation, surpassing the scope of existing interpretability methods. 2. Unlike conventional methods that focus on explaining decisions, our approach centers on interpreting representations. 3. It seamlessly integrates into pre-existing network architectures, requiring only fine-tuning of the inserted modules.

Abstract: Ubiquitous wearable and mobile devices provide access to a diverse set of data. However, the mobility demand for our devices naturally imposes constraints on their computational and communication capabilities. A solution is to locally learn knowledge from data captured by ubiquitous devices, rather than to store and transmit the data in its original form. In this paper, we develop a federated learning framework, called Centaur, to incorporate on-device data selection at the edge, which allows partition-based training of a deep neural nets through collaboration between constrained and resourceful devices within the multidevice ecosystem of the same user. We benchmark on five neural net architecture and six datasets that include image data and wearable sensor time series. On average, Centaur achieves ~19% higher classification accuracy and ~58% lower federated training latency, compared to the baseline. We also evaluate Centaur when dealing with imbalanced non-iid data, client participation heterogeneity, and different mobility patterns. To encourage further research in this area, we release our code at https://github.com/nokia-bell-labs/data-centric-federated-learning

Abstract: The Weisfeiler--Lehman (WL) test is a fundamental iterative algorithm for checking isomorphism of graphs. It has also been observed that it underlies the design of several graph neural network architectures, whose capabilities and performance can be understood in terms of the expressive power of this test. Motivated by recent developments in machine learning applications to datasets involving three-dimensional objects, we study when the WL test is {\em complete} for clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs, i.e., when it can distinguish, up to isometry, any arbitrary such cloud. %arbitrary clouds of euclidean points represented by complete distance graphs. % How many dimensions of the Weisfeiler--Lehman test is enough to distinguish any two non-isometric point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, assuming that these point clouds are given as complete graphs labeled by distances between the points? This question is important for understanding, which architectures of graph neural networks are capable of fully exploiting the spacial structure of a point cloud.
  Our main result states that the $(d-1)$-dimensional WL test is complete for point clouds in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any $d\ge 2$, and that only three iterations of the test suffice. We also observe that the $d$-dimensional WL test only requires one iteration to achieve completeness.
  Our paper thus provides complete understanding of the 3-dimensional case: it was shown in previous works that 1-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and we show that 2-WL is complete there. We also strengthen the lower bound for 1-WL by showing that it is unable to recognize planar point clouds in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Finally, we show that 2-WL is not complete in $\mathbb{R}^6$, leaving as an open question, whether it is complete in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ for $d = 4,5$.

Abstract: The objective of this work is to develop an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data processing tool that confers clinical context to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for error handling, bias mitigation and interpretability. We present Trust-MAPS, an algorithm that translates clinical domain knowledge into high-dimensional, mixed-integer programming models that capture physiological and biological constraints on clinical measurements. EMR data is projected onto this constrained space, effectively bringing outliers to fall within a physiologically feasible range. We then compute the distance of each data point from the constrained space modeling healthy physiology to quantify deviation from the norm. These distances, termed "trust-scores," are integrated into the feature space for downstream ML applications. We demonstrate the utility of Trust-MAPS by training a binary classifier for early sepsis prediction on data from the 2019 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge, using the XGBoost algorithm and applying SMOTE for overcoming class-imbalance. The Trust-MAPS framework shows desirable behavior in handling potential errors and boosting predictive performance. We achieve an AUROC of 0.91 (0.89, 0.92 : 95% CI) for predicting sepsis 6 hours before onset - a marked 15% improvement over a baseline model trained without Trust-MAPS. Trust-scores emerge as clinically meaningful features that not only boost predictive performance for clinical decision support tasks, but also lend interpretability to ML models. This work is the first to translate clinical domain knowledge into mathematical constraints, model cross-vital dependencies, and identify aberrations in high-dimensional medical data. Our method allows for error handling in EMR, and confers interpretability and superior predictive power to models trained for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) stand out for their impressive performance in intricate language modeling tasks. However, their demanding computational and memory needs pose obstacles for broad use on edge devices. Quantization is then introduced to boost LLMs' on-device efficiency. Recent works show that 8-bit or lower weight quantization is feasible with minimal impact on end-to-end task performance, while the activation is still not quantized. On the other hand, mainstream commodity edge devices still struggle to execute these sub-8-bit quantized networks effectively. In this paper, we propose Agile-Quant, an activation-guided quantization framework for popular Large Language Models (LLMs), and implement an end-to-end accelerator on multiple edge devices for faster inference. Considering the hardware profiling and activation analysis, we first introduce a basic activation quantization strategy to balance the trade-off of task performance and real inference speed. Then we leverage the activation-aware token pruning technique to reduce the outliers and the adverse impact on attentivity. Ultimately, we utilize the SIMD-based 4-bit multiplier and our efficient TRIP matrix multiplication to implement the accelerator for LLMs on the edge. We apply our framework on different scales of LLMs including LLaMA, OPT, and BLOOM with 4-bit or 8-bit for the activation and 4-bit for the weight quantization. Experiments show that Agile-Quant achieves simultaneous quantization of model weights and activations while maintaining task performance comparable to existing weight-only quantization methods. Moreover, in the 8- and 4-bit scenario, Agile-Quant achieves an on-device speedup of up to 2.55x compared to its FP16 counterparts across multiple edge devices, marking a pioneering advancement in this domain.

Abstract: This paper explores the frontiers of large language models (LLMs) in psychology applications. Psychology has undergone several theoretical changes, and the current use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, particularly LLMs, promises to open up new research directions. We provide a detailed exploration of how LLMs like ChatGPT are transforming psychological research. It discusses the impact of LLMs across various branches of psychology, including cognitive and behavioral, clinical and counseling, educational and developmental, and social and cultural psychology, highlighting their potential to simulate aspects of human cognition and behavior. The paper delves into the capabilities of these models to emulate human-like text generation, offering innovative tools for literature review, hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental subjects, data analysis, academic writing, and peer review in psychology. While LLMs are essential in advancing research methodologies in psychology, the paper also cautions about their technical and ethical challenges. There are issues like data privacy, the ethical implications of using LLMs in psychological research, and the need for a deeper understanding of these models' limitations. Researchers should responsibly use LLMs in psychological studies, adhering to ethical standards and considering the potential consequences of deploying these technologies in sensitive areas. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLMs in psychology, exploring potential benefits and challenges. It serves as a call to action for researchers to leverage LLMs' advantages responsibly while addressing associated risks.

Abstract: In dynamic collaborative settings, for artificial intelligence (AI) agents to better align with humans, they must adapt to novel teammates who utilise unforeseen strategies. While adaptation is often simple for humans, it can be challenging for AI agents. Our work introduces symmetry-breaking augmentations (SBA) as a novel approach to this challenge. By applying a symmetry-flipping operation to increase behavioural diversity among training teammates, SBA encourages agents to learn robust responses to unknown strategies, highlighting how social conventions impact human-AI alignment. We demonstrate this experimentally in two settings, showing that our approach outperforms previous ad hoc teamwork results in the challenging card game Hanabi. In addition, we propose a general metric for estimating symmetry dependency amongst a given set of policies. Our findings provide insights into how AI systems can better adapt to diverse human conventions and the core mechanics of alignment.

Abstract: In multiclass classification over $n$ outcomes, the outcomes must be embedded into the reals with dimension at least $n-1$ in order to design a consistent surrogate loss that leads to the "correct" classification, regardless of the data distribution. For large $n$, such as in information retrieval and structured prediction tasks, optimizing a surrogate in $n-1$ dimensions is often intractable. We investigate ways to trade off surrogate loss dimension, the number of problem instances, and restricting the region of consistency in the simplex for multiclass classification. Following past work, we examine an intuitive embedding procedure that maps outcomes into the vertices of convex polytopes in a low-dimensional surrogate space. We show that full-dimensional subsets of the simplex exist around each point mass distribution for which consistency holds, but also, with less than $n-1$ dimensions, there exist distributions for which a phenomenon called hallucination occurs, which is when the optimal report under the surrogate loss is an outcome with zero probability. Looking towards application, we derive a result to check if consistency holds under a given polytope embedding and low-noise assumption, providing insight into when to use a particular embedding. We provide examples of embedding $n = 2^{d}$ outcomes into the $d$-dimensional unit cube and $n = d!$ outcomes into the $d$-dimensional permutahedron under low-noise assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that with multiple problem instances, we can learn the mode with $\frac{n}{2}$ dimensions over the whole simplex.

Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a powerful framework for analysing distributed data, yet two challenges remain pivotal: heterogeneity across sites and privacy of local data. In this paper, we address both challenges within a federated transfer learning framework, aiming to enhance learning on a target data set by leveraging information from multiple heterogeneous source data sets while adhering to privacy constraints. We rigorously formulate the notion of federated differential privacy, which offers privacy guarantees for each data set without assuming a trusted central server. Under this privacy model, we study three classical statistical problems: univariate mean estimation, low-dimensional linear regression, and high-dimensional linear regression. By investigating the minimax rates and quantifying the cost of privacy in each problem, we show that federated differential privacy is an intermediate privacy model between the well-established local and central models of differential privacy. Our analyses account for data heterogeneity and privacy, highlighting the fundamental costs associated with each factor and the benefits of knowledge transfer in federated learning.

Abstract: Streaming data clustering is a popular research topic in data mining and machine learning. Since streaming data is usually analyzed in data chunks, it is more susceptible to encounter the dynamic cluster imbalance issue. That is, the imbalance ratio of clusters changes over time, which can easily lead to fluctuations in either the accuracy or the efficiency of streaming data clustering. Therefore, we propose an accurate and efficient streaming data clustering approach to adapt the drifting and imbalanced cluster distributions. We first design a Self-Growth Map (SGM) that can automatically arrange neurons on demand according to local distribution, and thus achieve fast and incremental adaptation to the streaming distributions. Since SGM allocates an excess number of density-sensitive neurons to describe the global distribution, it can avoid missing small clusters among imbalanced distributions. We also propose a fast hierarchical merging strategy to combine the neurons that break up the relatively large clusters. It exploits the maintained SGM to quickly retrieve the intra-cluster distribution pairs for merging, which circumvents the most laborious global searching. It turns out that the proposed SGM can incrementally adapt to the distributions of new chunks, and the Self-grOwth map-guided Hierarchical merging for Imbalanced data clustering (SOHI) approach can quickly explore a true number of imbalanced clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOHI can efficiently and accurately explore cluster distributions for streaming data.

Abstract: Score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for sampling high-dimensional probability distributions. Despite their effectiveness, their theoretical underpinnings remain relatively underdeveloped. In this work, we study the convergence properties of deterministic samplers based on probability flow ODEs from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Assuming access to $L^2$-accurate estimates of the score function, we prove the total variation between the target and the generated data distributions can be bounded above by $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2})$ in the continuous time level, where $d$ denotes the data dimension and $\delta$ represents the $L^2$-score matching error. For practical implementations using a $p$-th order Runge-Kutta integrator with step size $h$, we establish error bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2} + d\cdot(dh)^p)$ at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical studies on problems up to 128 dimensions to verify our theory.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds great potential for diverse applications owing to its privacy-preserving nature. However, its convergence is often challenged by non-IID data distributions, limiting its effectiveness in real-world deployments. Existing methods help address these challenges via optimization-based client constraints, adaptive client selection, or the use of pre-trained models or synthetic data. In this work, we reinterpret these approaches as all introducing an \emph{implicit guiding task} to regularize and steer client learning. Following this insight, we propose to introduce an \emph{explicit global guiding task} into the current FL framework to improve convergence and performance. To this end, we present \textbf{FedEGG}, a new FL algorithm that constructs a global guiding task using a well-defined, easy-to-converge learning task based on a public dataset and Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach effectively combines the strengths of federated (the original FL task) and centralized (the global guiding task) learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of FedEGG's convergence, examining the impact of data heterogeneity between the guiding and FL tasks and the guiding strength. Our analysis derives an upper bound for the optimal guiding strength, offering practical insights for implementation. Empirically, FedEGG demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art FL methods under both IID and non-IID settings, and further improves their performances when combined.

Abstract: Analyzing the cardiovascular system condition via Electrocardiography (ECG) is a common and highly effective approach, and it has been practiced and perfected over many decades. ECG sensing is non-invasive and relatively easy to acquire, and yet it is still cumbersome for holter monitoring tests that may span over hours and even days. A possible alternative in this context is Photoplethysmography (PPG): An optically-based signal that measures blood volume fluctuations, as typically sensed by conventional ``wearable devices''. While PPG presents clear advantages in acquisition, convenience, and cost-effectiveness, ECG provides more comprehensive information, allowing for a more precise detection of heart conditions. This implies that a conversion from PPG to ECG, as recently discussed in the literature, inherently involves an unavoidable level of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for addressing the PPG-2-ECG conversion, and offer an enhanced classification of cardiovascular conditions using the given PPG, all while taking into account the uncertainties arising from the conversion process. We provide a mathematical justification for our proposed computational approach, and present empirical studies demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Abstract: This study presents insights gathered from surveys and discussions with specialists in three domains, aiming to find essential elements for a universal explanation framework that could be applied to these and other similar use cases. The insights are incorporated into a software tool that utilizes GP algorithms, known for their interpretability. The applications analyzed include a medical scenario (involving predictive ML), a retail use case (involving prescriptive ML), and an energy use case (also involving predictive ML). We interviewed professionals from each sector, transcribing their conversations for further analysis. Additionally, experts and non-experts in these fields filled out questionnaires designed to probe various dimensions of explanatory methods. The findings indicate a universal preference for sacrificing a degree of accuracy in favor of greater explainability. Additionally, we highlight the significance of feature importance and counterfactual explanations as critical components of such a framework. Our questionnaires are publicly available to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge in the field of XAI.

<title>A direct proof of a unified law of robustness for Bregman divergence losses</title>

Abstract: In contemporary deep learning practice, models are often trained to near zero loss i.e. to nearly interpolate the training data. However, the number of parameters in the model is usually far more than the number of data points n, the theoretical minimum needed for interpolation: a phenomenon referred to as overparameterization. In an interesting piece of work, Bubeck and Sellke considered a natural notion of interpolation: the model is said to interpolate when the model's training loss goes below the loss of the conditional expectation of the response given the covariate. For this notion of interpolation and for a broad class of covariate distributions (specifically those satisfying a natural notion of concentration of measure), they showed that overparameterization is necessary for robust interpolation i.e. if the interpolating function is required to be Lipschitz. Their main proof technique applies to regression with square loss against a scalar response, but they remark that via a connection to Rademacher complexity and using tools such as the Ledoux-Talagrand contraction inequality, their result can be extended to more general losses, at least in the case of scalar response variables. In this work, we recast the original proof technique of Bubeck and Sellke in terms of a bias-variance type decomposition, and show that this view directly unlocks a generalization to Bregman divergence losses (even for vector-valued responses), without the use of tools such as Rademacher complexity or the Ledoux-Talagrand contraction principle. Bregman divergences are a natural class of losses since for these, the best estimator is the conditional expectation of the response given the covariate, and include other practical losses such as the cross entropy loss. Our work thus gives a more general understanding of the main proof technique of Bubeck and Sellke and demonstrates its broad utility.

Abstract: Acquiring complex behaviors is essential for artificially intelligent agents, yet learning these behaviors in high-dimensional settings poses a significant challenge due to the vast search space. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) requires extensive manual effort for reward function engineering. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) uncovers reward functions from expert demonstrations but relies on an iterative process that is often computationally expensive. Imitation learning (IL) provides a more efficient alternative by directly comparing an agent's actions to expert demonstrations; however, in high-dimensional environments, such direct comparisons often offer insufficient feedback for effective learning. We introduce RILe (Reinforced Imitation Learning), a framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn a dense reward function efficiently and achieve strong performance in high-dimensional tasks. RILe employs a novel trainer-student framework: the trainer learns an adaptive reward function, and the student uses this reward signal to imitate expert behaviors. By dynamically adjusting its guidance as the student evolves, the trainer provides nuanced feedback across different phases of learning. Our framework produces high-performing policies in high-dimensional tasks where direct imitation fails to replicate complex behaviors. We validate RILe in challenging robotic locomotion tasks, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves near-expert performance across multiple settings.

Abstract: We introduce DataComp for Language Models (DCLM), a testbed for controlled dataset experiments with the goal of improving language models. As part of DCLM, we provide a standardized corpus of 240T tokens extracted from Common Crawl, effective pretraining recipes based on the OpenLM framework, and a broad suite of 53 downstream evaluations. Participants in the DCLM benchmark can experiment with data curation strategies such as deduplication, filtering, and data mixing at model scales ranging from 412M to 7B parameters. As a baseline for DCLM, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model-based filtering is key to assembling a high-quality training set. The resulting dataset, DCLM-Baseline enables training a 7B parameter language model from scratch to 64% 5-shot accuracy on MMLU with 2.6T training tokens. Compared to MAP-Neo, the previous state-of-the-art in open-data language models, DCLM-Baseline represents a 6.6 percentage point improvement on MMLU while being trained with 40% less compute. Our baseline model is also comparable to Mistral-7B-v0.3 and Llama 3 8B on MMLU (63% & 66%), and performs similarly on an average of 53 natural language understanding tasks while being trained with 6.6x less compute than Llama 3 8B. Our results highlight the importance of dataset design for training language models and offer a starting point for further research on data curation.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their safety and reliability, particularly regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that attributes this vulnerability to reward misspecification during the alignment process. This misspecification occurs when the reward function fails to accurately capture the intended behavior, leading to misaligned model outputs. We introduce a metric ReGap to quantify the extent of reward misspecification and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness in detecting harmful backdoor prompts. Building upon these insights, we present ReMiss, a system for automated red teaming that generates adversarial prompts in a reward-misspecified space. ReMiss achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on the AdvBench benchmark against various target aligned LLMs while preserving the human readability of the generated prompts. Furthermore, these attacks on open-source models demonstrate high transferability to closed-source models like GPT-4o and out-of-distribution tasks from HarmBench. Detailed analysis highlights the unique advantages of the proposed reward misspecification objective compared to previous methods, offering new insights for improving LLM safety and robustness.

Abstract: We propose a transformer architecture for time series forecasting with a focus on time series tokenisation and apply it to a real-world prediction problem from the pricing domain. Our architecture aims to learn effective representations at many scales across all available data simultaneously. The model contains a number of novel modules: a differentiated form of time series patching which employs multiple resolutions, a multiple-resolution module for time-varying known variables, a mixer-based module for capturing cross-series information, and a novel output head with favourable scaling to account for the increased number of tokens. We present an application of this model to a real world prediction problem faced by the markdown team at a very large retailer. On the experiments conducted our model outperforms in-house models and the selected existing deep learning architectures.

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is the current gold-standard for ensuring privacy for statistical queries. Estimation problems under DP constraints appearing in the literature have largely focused on providing equal privacy to all users. We consider the problems of empirical mean estimation for univariate data and frequency estimation for categorical data, both subject to heterogeneous privacy constraints. Each user, contributing a sample to the dataset, is allowed to have a different privacy demand. The dataset itself is assumed to be worst-case and we study both problems under two different formulations -- first, where privacy demands and data may be correlated, and second, where correlations are weakened by random permutation of the dataset. We establish theoretical performance guarantees for our proposed algorithms, under both PAC error and mean-squared error. These performance guarantees translate to minimax optimality in several instances, and experiments confirm superior performance of our algorithms over other baseline techniques.

Abstract: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.

Abstract: When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to jointly denoise the features and rewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervision has the potential to transform reinforcement learning (RL), paralleling the breakthroughs it has enabled in other areas of machine learning. While self-supervised learning in other domains aims to find patterns in a fixed dataset, self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) agents discover new behaviors by learning from the goals achieved during unstructured interaction with the environment. However, these methods have failed to see similar success, both due to a lack of data from slow environment simulations as well as a lack of stable algorithms. We take a step toward addressing both of these issues by releasing a high-performance codebase and benchmark (JaxGCRL) for self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to train agents for millions of environment steps in minutes on a single GPU. By utilizing GPU-accelerated replay buffers, environments, and a stable contrastive RL algorithm, we reduce training time by up to $22\times$. Additionally, we assess key design choices in contrastive RL, identifying those that most effectively stabilize and enhance training performance. With this approach, we provide a foundation for future research in self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to quickly iterate on new ideas and evaluate them in diverse and challenging environments.

Abstract: To embed structured knowledge within labels into feature representations, prior work [Zeng et al., 2022] proposed to use the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient (CPCC) as a regularizer during supervised learning. This regularizer calculates pairwise Euclidean distances of class means and aligns them with the corresponding shortest path distances derived from the label hierarchy tree. However, class means may not be good representatives of the class conditional distributions, especially when they are multi-mode in nature. To address this limitation, under the CPCC framework, we propose to use the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to measure the pairwise distances among classes in the feature space. We show that our exact EMD method generalizes previous work, and recovers the existing algorithm when class-conditional distributions are Gaussian. To further improve the computational efficiency of our method, we introduce the Optimal Transport-CPCC family by exploring four EMD approximation variants. Our most efficient OT-CPCC variant, the proposed Fast FlowTree algorithm, runs in linear time in the size of the dataset, while maintaining competitive performance across datasets and tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/OTCPCC.

Abstract: In real-world applications, learning-enabled systems often undergo iterative model development to address challenging or emerging tasks, which involve collecting new data, training a new model and validating the model. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose good capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. While existing continual learning aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance, it often falls short in cost-sensitive applications, where failing to preserve essential established capabilities introduces unforeseen costs and risks and substantial expenses for re-improving these capabilities. To address this issue, we impose a requirement on learning systems to ensure that a new model strictly retains important capabilities of the old model while improving target-task performance, which we term model developmental safety. To ensure model developmental safety, we propose a retention-centric framework with data-dependent constraints, and study how to continually develop a pretrained CLIP model for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees and use its insights to finetune the CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Experiments on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets validate the efficacy of our method.

Abstract: Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting input data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance performance; (3) The strategies employed by LLMs may differ from those used in conventional algorithms.

Abstract: Real-world data often violates the equal-variance assumption (homoscedasticity), making it essential to account for heteroscedastic noise in causal discovery. In this work, we explore heteroscedastic symmetric noise models (HSNMs), where the effect $Y$ is modeled as $Y = f(X) + \sigma(X)N$, with $X$ as the cause and $N$ as independent noise following a symmetric distribution. We introduce a novel criterion for identifying HSNMs based on the skewness of the score (i.e., the gradient of the log density) of the data distribution. This criterion establishes a computationally tractable measurement that is zero in the causal direction but nonzero in the anticausal direction, enabling the causal direction discovery. We extend this skewness-based criterion to the multivariate setting and propose SkewScore, an algorithm that handles heteroscedastic noise without requiring the extraction of exogenous noise. We also conduct a case study on the robustness of SkewScore in a bivariate model with a latent confounder, providing theoretical insights into its performance. Empirical studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<title>DARE the Extreme: Revisiting Delta-Parameter Pruning For Fine-Tuned Models</title>

Abstract: Storing open-source fine-tuned models separately introduces redundancy and increases response times in applications utilizing multiple models. Delta-parameter pruning (DPP), particularly the random drop and rescale (DARE) method proposed by Yu et al., addresses this by pruning the majority of delta parameters--the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights--while typically maintaining minimal performance loss. However, DARE fails when either the pruning rate or the magnitude of the delta parameters is large. We highlight two key reasons for this failure: (1) an excessively large rescaling factor as pruning rates increase, and (2) high mean and variance in the delta parameters. To push DARE's limits, we introduce DAREx (DARE the eXtreme), which features two algorithmic improvements: (1) DAREx-q, a rescaling factor modification that significantly boosts performance at high pruning rates (e.g., >30 % on COLA and SST2 for encoder models, with even greater gains in decoder models), and (2) DAREx-L2, which combines DARE with AdamR, an in-training method that applies appropriate delta regularization before DPP. We also demonstrate that DAREx-q can be seamlessly combined with vanilla parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and can facilitate structural DPP. Additionally, we revisit the application of importance-based pruning techniques within DPP, demonstrating that they outperform random-based methods when delta parameters are large. Through this comprehensive study, we develop a pipeline for selecting the most appropriate DPP method under various practical scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.

<title>Context-Parametric Inversion: Why Instruction Finetuning Can Worsen Context Reliance</title>

Abstract: A standard practice when using large language models is for users to supplement their instruction with an input context containing new information for the model to process. However, models struggle to reliably follow the input context, especially when it conflicts with their parametric knowledge from pretraining. In-principle, one would expect models to adapt to the user context better after instruction finetuning, particularly when handling knowledge conflicts. However, we observe a surprising failure mode: during instruction tuning, the context reliance under knowledge conflicts initially increases as expected, but then gradually decreases as instruction finetuning progresses. This happens while the performance on standard benchmarks keeps on increasing far after this drop. We call this phenomenon context-parametric inversion and observe it across multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets such as TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, across different model families like Llama, Mistral, and Pythia. We perform various controlled studies and theoretical analysis to show that context-parametric inversion occurs due to examples in the instruction finetuning data where the input context provides information that aligns with model's parametric knowledge. Our analysis suggests some natural mitigation strategies with limited but insightful gains, and serves as a useful starting point in addressing this deficiency in instruction finetuning.

Abstract: Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents' capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes. Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies, illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's limitations.

Abstract: We study a federated version of multi-objective optimization (MOO), where a single model is trained to optimize multiple objective functions. MOO has been extensively studied in the centralized setting but is less explored in federated or distributed settings. We propose FedCMOO, a novel communication-efficient federated multi-objective optimization (FMOO) algorithm that improves the error convergence performance of the model compared to existing approaches. Unlike prior works, the communication cost of FedCMOO does not scale with the number of objectives, as each client sends a single aggregated gradient to the central server. We provide a convergence analysis of the proposed method for smooth and non-convex objective functions under milder assumptions than in prior work. In addition, we introduce a variant of FedCMOO that allows users to specify a preference over the objectives in terms of a desired ratio of the final objective values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over baseline approaches.

Abstract: The utilization of large foundational models has a dilemma: while fine-tuning downstream tasks from them holds promise for making use of the well-generalized knowledge in practical applications, their open accessibility also poses threats of adverse usage. This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

<title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>

Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.

<title>Fast and scalable Wasserstein-1 neural optimal transport solver for single-cell perturbation prediction</title>

Abstract: \textbf{Motivation:} Predicting single-cell perturbation responses requires mapping between two unpaired single-cell data distributions. Optimal transport (OT) theory provides a principled framework for constructing such mappings by minimizing transport cost. Recently, Wasserstein-2 ($W_2$) neural optimal transport solvers (\textit{e.g.}, CellOT) have been employed for this prediction task. However, $W_2$ OT relies on the general Kantorovich dual formulation, which involves optimizing over two conjugate functions, leading to a complex min-max optimization problem that converges slowly. \\ \textbf{Results:} To address these challenges, we propose a novel solver based on the Wasserstein-1 ($W_1$) dual formulation. Unlike $W_2$, the $W_1$ dual simplifies the optimization to a maximization problem over a single 1-Lipschitz function, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming min-max optimization. While solving the $W_1$ dual only reveals the transport direction and does not directly provide a unique optimal transport map, we incorporate an additional step using adversarial training to determine an appropriate transport step size, effectively recovering the transport map. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed $W_1$ neural optimal transport solver can mimic the $W_2$ OT solvers in finding a unique and ``monotonic" map on 2D datasets. Moreover, the $W_1$ OT solver achieves performance on par with or surpasses $W_2$ OT solvers on real single-cell perturbation datasets. Furthermore, we show that $W_1$ OT solver achieves $25 \sim 45\times$ speedup, scales better on high dimensional transportation task, and can be directly applied on single-cell RNA-seq dataset with highly variable genes. \\ \textbf{Availability and Implementation:} Our implementation and experiments are open-sourced at https://github.com/poseidonchan/w1ot.

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization has been widely adopted in scientific experiment design, including drug discovery and hyperparameter optimization. In practice, regulatory or safety concerns often impose additional thresholds on certain attributes of the experimental outcomes. Previous work has primarily focused on constrained single-objective optimization tasks or active search under constraints. The existing constrained multi-objective algorithms address the issue with heuristics and approximations, posing challenges to the analysis of the sample efficiency. We propose a novel constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm COMBOO that balances active learning of the level-set defined on multiple unknowns with multi-objective optimization within the feasible region. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach on various synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications.

<title>Mining the Minoria: Unknown, Under-represented, and Under-performing Minority Groups</title>

Abstract: Due to a variety of reasons, such as privacy, data in the wild often misses the grouping information required for identifying minorities. On the other hand, it is known that machine learning models are only as good as the data they are trained on and, hence, may underperform for the under-represented minority groups. The missing grouping information presents a dilemma for responsible data scientists who find themselves in an unknown-unknown situation, where not only do they not have access to the grouping attributes but do not also know what groups to consider.
  This paper is an attempt to address this dilemma. Specifically, we propose a minority mining problem, where we find vectors in the attribute space that reveal potential groups that are under-represented and under-performing. Technically speaking, we propose a geometric transformation of data into a dual space and use notions such as the arrangement of hyperplanes to design an efficient algorithm for the problem in lower dimensions. Generalizing our solution to the higher dimensions is cursed by dimensionality. Therefore, we propose a solution based on smart exploration of the search space for such cases. We conduct comprehensive experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets alongside the theoretical analysis. Our experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions in mining the unknown, under-represented, and under-performing minorities.

Abstract: Language model performance depends on identifying the optimal mixture of data groups to train on (e.g., law, code, math). Prior work has proposed a diverse set of methods to efficiently learn mixture proportions, ranging from fitting regression models over training runs to dynamically updating proportions throughout training. Surprisingly, we find that no existing method consistently outperforms a simple stratified sampling baseline in terms of average test perplexity. To understand this inconsistency, we unify existing methods into a standard framework, showing they are equivalent to solving a common optimization problem: minimize average loss subject to a method-specific mixing law -- an implicit assumption on the relationship between loss and mixture proportions. This framework suggests that measuring the fidelity of a method's mixing law can offer insights into its performance. Empirically, we find that existing methods set their mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in the inconsistent mixing performance we observe. Using this insight, we derive a new online method named Aioli, which directly estimates the mixing law parameters throughout training and uses them to dynamically adjust proportions. Aioli outperforms stratified sampling on 6 out of 6 datasets by an average of 0.27 test perplexity points, whereas existing methods fail to consistently beat stratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points worse. Moreover, in a practical setting where proportions are learned on shorter runs due to computational constraints, Aioli can dynamically adjust these proportions over the full training run, consistently improving performance over existing methods by up to 12.012 test perplexity points.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations, such as semantic sentiment analysis and text synthesis, often raise privacy concerns and demand significant on-device computational resources. Centralized learning (CL) on the edge provides an energy-efficient alternative but requires collecting raw data, compromising user privacy. While federated learning (FL) enhances privacy, it imposes high computational energy demands on resource-constrained devices. This study provides insights into deploying privacy-preserving, energy-efficient NLP models on edge devices. We introduce semantic split learning (SL) as an energy-efficient, privacy-preserving tiny machine learning (TinyML) framework and compare it to FL and CL in the presence of Rayleigh fading and additive noise. Our results show that SL significantly reduces computational power and CO2 emissions while enhancing privacy, as evidenced by a fourfold increase in reconstruction error compared to FL and nearly eighteen times that of CL. In contrast, FL offers a balanced trade-off between privacy and efficiency. Our code is available for replication at our GitHub repository: https://github.com/AhmedRadwan02/TinyEco2AI-NLP.

Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in open-world scenarios often encounter unfamiliar conditions and perform poorly in unanticipated situations. As AI systems advance and find application in safety-critical domains, effectively handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial to building open-world learning systems. In this work, we introduce ALOE, a novel active learning algorithm for open-world environments designed to enhance model adaptation by incorporating new OOD classes via a two-stage approach. First, diversity sampling selects a representative set of examples, followed by energy-based OOD detection to prioritize likely unknown classes for annotation. This strategy accelerates class discovery and learning, even under constrained annotation budgets. Evaluations on three long-tailed image classification benchmarks demonstrate that ALOE outperforms traditional active learning baselines, effectively expanding known categories while balancing annotation cost. Our findings reveal a crucial tradeoff between enhancing known-class performance and discovering new classes, setting the stage for future advancements in open-world machine learning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning algorithms are increasingly important as legal concerns arise around the provenance of training data, but verifying the success of unlearning is often difficult. Provable guarantees for unlearning are often limited to supervised learning settings. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical guarantees for unlearning in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm by studying topic models, simple bag-of-words language models that can be adapted to solve downstream tasks like retrieval and classification. First, we design a provably effective unlearning algorithm for topic models that incurs a computational overhead independent of the size of the original dataset. Our analysis additionally quantifies the deletion capacity of the model -- i.e., the number of examples that can be unlearned without incurring a significant cost in model performance. Finally, we formally extend our analyses to account for adaptation to a given downstream task. In particular, we design an efficient algorithm to perform unlearning after fine-tuning the topic model via a linear head. Notably, we show that it is easier to unlearn pre-training data from models that have been fine-tuned to a particular task, and one can unlearn this data without modifying the base model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable mathematical capabilities, largely driven by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes complex reasoning into step-by-step solutions. This approach has enabled significant advancements, as evidenced by performance on benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. However, the mechanisms underlying LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic in a single step of CoT remain poorly understood. Existing studies debate whether LLMs encode numerical values or rely on symbolic reasoning, while others explore attention and multi-layered processing in arithmetic tasks. In this work, we propose that LLMs learn arithmetic by capturing algebraic structures, such as commutativity and identity properties. Since these structures are observable through input-output relationships, they can generalize to unseen data. We empirically demonstrate that LLMs can learn algebraic structures using a custom dataset of arithmetic problems, as well as providing theoretical evidence showing that, under specific configurations of weights and biases, the transformer-based LLMs can generate embeddings that remain invariant to both permutations of input tokens and the presence of identity elements. Our findings indicate that leveraging algebraic structures can enhance the LLMs' arithmetic capabilities, offering insights into improving their arithmetic performance.

Abstract: As AI models expand in size, it has become increasingly challenging to deploy federated learning (FL) on resource-constrained edge devices. To tackle this issue, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as an FL framework with reduced workload on edge devices via model splitting; it has received extensive attention from the research community in recent years. Nevertheless, most prior works on SFL focus only on a two-tier architecture without harnessing multi-tier cloudedge computing resources. In this paper, we intend to analyze and optimize the learning performance of SFL under multi-tier systems. Specifically, we propose the hierarchical SFL (HSFL) framework and derive its convergence bound. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem for model splitting (MS) and model aggregation (MA). To solve this rather hard problem, we then decompose it into MS and MA subproblems that can be solved via an iterative descending algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the tailored algorithm can effectively optimize MS and MA for SFL within virtually any multi-tier system.

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Age prediction using brain imaging, such as MRIs, has achieved promising results, with several studies identifying the model's residual as a potential biomarker for chronic disease states. In this study, we developed a brain age predictive model using a dataset of 1,220 U.S. veterans (18--80 years) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on two-dimensional slices of axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI images. The model, incorporating a degree-3 polynomial ensemble, achieved an $R^{2}$ of 0.816 on the testing set. Images were acquired at the level of the anterior commissure and the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Residual analysis was performed to assess its potential as a biomarker for five ICD-coded conditions: hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), illicit substance abuse/dependence (SAD), and alcohol abuse/dependence (AAD). Residuals grouped by the number of ICD-coded conditions demonstrated different trends that were statistically significant ($p = 0.002$), suggesting a relationship between disease states and predicted brain age. This association was particularly pronounced in patients over 49 years, where negative residuals (indicating advanced brain aging) correlated with the presence of multiple ICD codes. These findings support the potential of residuals as biomarkers for detecting latent health conditions.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations demand an unprecedented combination of accuracy and scalability to tackle grand challenges in catalysis and materials design. To bridge this gap, we present AlphaNet, a local-frame-based equivariant model that simultaneously improves computational efficiency and predictive precision for interatomic interactions. By constructing equivariant local frames with learnable geometric transitions, AlphaNet encodes atomic environments with enhanced representational capacity, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in energy and force predictions. Extensive benchmarks on large-scale datasets spanning molecular reactions, crystal stability, and surface catalysis (Matbench Discovery and OC2M) demonstrate its superior performance over existing neural network interatomic potentials while ensuring scalability across diverse system sizes with varying types of interatomic interactions. The synergy of accuracy, efficiency, and transferability positions AlphaNet as a transformative tool for modeling multiscale phenomena, decoding dynamics in catalysis and functional interfaces, with direct implications for accelerating the discovery of complex molecular systems and functional materials.

Abstract: Venezuelan banks have historically made credit card limit adjustment decisions manually through committees. However, since the number of credit card holders in Venezuela is expected to increase in the upcoming months due to economic improvements, manual decisions are starting to become unfeasible. In this project, a machine learning model that uses cost-sensitive learning is proposed to automate the task of handing out credit card limit increases. To accomplish this, several neural network and XGBoost models are trained and compared, leveraging Venezolano de Credito's data and using grid search with 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed model is ultimately chosen due to its superior balance of accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and interpretability. The model's performance is evaluated against the committee's decisions using Cohen's kappa coefficient, showing an almost perfect agreement.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) enables deep neural networks to adapt to ever-changing data distributions. In practice, there may be scenarios where annotation is costly, leading to active continual learning (ACL), which performs active learning (AL) for the CL scenarios when reducing the labeling cost by selecting the most informative subset is preferable. However, conventional AL strategies are not suitable for ACL, as they focus solely on learning the new knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. Therefore, ACL requires a new AL strategy that can balance the prevention of catastrophic forgetting and the ability to quickly learn new tasks. In this paper, we propose AccuACL, Accumulated informativeness-based Active Continual Learning, by the novel use of the Fisher information matrix as a criterion for sample selection, derived from a theoretical analysis of the Fisher-optimality preservation properties within the framework of ACL, while also addressing the scalability issue of Fisher information-based AL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AccuACL significantly outperforms AL baselines across various CL algorithms, increasing the average accuracy and forgetting by 23.8% and 17.0%, respectively, on average.

Abstract: Alzheimers disease is a deadly neurological condition, impairing important memory and brain functions. Alzheimers disease promotes brain shrinkage, ultimately leading to dementia. Dementia diagnosis typically takes 2.8 to 4.4 years after the first clinical indication. Advancements in computing and information technology have led to many techniques of studying Alzheimers disease. Early identification and therapy are crucial for preventing Alzheimers disease, as early-onset dementia hits people before the age of 65, while late-onset dementia occurs after this age. According to the 2015 World Alzheimers disease Report, there are 46.8 million individuals worldwide suffering from dementia, with an anticipated 74.7 million more by 2030 and 131.5 million by 2050. Deep Learning has outperformed conventional Machine Learning techniques by identifying intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), have achieved an accuracy of up to 96.0% for Alzheimers disease classification, and 84.2% for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction. There have been few literature surveys available on applying ML to predict dementia, lacking in congenital observations. However, this survey has focused on a specific data channel for dementia detection. This study evaluated Deep Learning algorithms for early Alzheimers disease detection, using openly accessible datasets, feature segmentation, and classification methods. This article also has identified research gaps and limits in detecting Alzheimers disease, which can inform future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly improved response accuracy and relevance by incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG methods primarily focus on generating text-only answers, even in Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) scenarios, where multimodal elements are retrieved to assist in generating text answers. To address this, we introduce the Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) task, in which we aim to generate multimodal answers that combine both text and images, fully leveraging the multimodal data within a corpus. Despite growing attention to this challenging task, a notable lack of a comprehensive benchmark persists for effectively evaluating its performance. To bridge this gap, we provide MRAMG-Bench, a meticulously curated, human-annotated benchmark comprising 4,346 documents, 14,190 images, and 4,800 QA pairs, distributed across six distinct datasets and spanning three domains: Web, Academia, and Lifestyle. The datasets incorporate diverse difficulty levels and complex multi-image scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating the MRAMG task. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, MRAMG-Bench incorporates a comprehensive suite of both statistical and LLM-based metrics, enabling a thorough analysis of the performance of generative models in the MRAMG task. Additionally, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal answer generation framework that can leverage LLMs/MLLMs to generate multimodal responses. Our datasets and complete evaluation results for 11 popular generative models are available at https://github.com/MRAMG-Bench/MRAMG.

Abstract: This paper investigates the anti-jamming channel access problem in complex and unknown jamming environments, where the jammer could dynamically adjust its strategies to target different channels. Traditional channel hopping anti-jamming approaches using fixed patterns are ineffective against such dynamic jamming attacks. Although the emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based dynamic channel access approach could achieve the Nash equilibrium under fast-changing jamming attacks, it requires extensive training episodes. To address this issue, we propose a fast adaptive anti-jamming channel access approach guided by the intuition of ``learning faster than the jammer", where a synchronously updated coarse-grained spectrum prediction serves as an auxiliary task for the deep Q learning (DQN) based anti-jamming model. This helps the model identify a superior Q-function compared to standard DRL while significantly reducing the number of training episodes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the rate of convergence in model training, reducing the required training episodes by up to 70% compared to standard DRL. Additionally, it also achieves a 10% improvement in throughput over NE strategies, owing to the effective use of coarse-grained spectrum prediction.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning framework where multiple clients, from mobiles to enterprises, collaboratively construct a model under the orchestration of a central server but still retain the decentralized nature of the training data. This decentralized training of models offers numerous advantages, including cost savings, enhanced privacy, improved security, and compliance with legal requirements. However, for all its apparent advantages, FL is not immune to the limitations of conventional machine learning methodologies. This article provides an elaborate explanation of the inherent concepts and features found within federated learning architecture, addressing five key domains: system heterogeneity, data partitioning, machine learning models, communication protocols, and privacy techniques. This article also highlights the limitations in this domain and proposes avenues for future work. Besides, we provide a set of architectural patterns for federated learning systems, which are derived from the systematic survey of the literature. The main elements of FL, the fundamentals of Federated Learning, and a few architectural specifics will all be better understood with the aid of this research.

Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) leverages Federated Learning (FL) for distributed model training while preserving data privacy, and meta-computing enhances FL by optimizing and integrating distributed computing resources, improving efficiency and scalability. Efficient IIoT operations require a trade-off between model quality and training latency. Consequently, a primary challenge of FL in IIoT is to optimize overall system performance by balancing model quality and training latency. This paper designs a satisfaction function that accounts for data size, Age of Information (AoI), and training latency for meta-computing. Additionally, the satisfaction function is incorporated into the utility functions to incentivize nodes in IIoT participation in model training. We model the utility functions of servers and nodes as a two-stage Stackelberg game and employ a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn the Stackelberg equilibrium. This approach ensures balanced rewards and enhances the applicability of the incentive scheme for IIoT. Simulation results demonstrate that, under the same budget constraints, the proposed incentive scheme improves utility by at least 23.7% compared to existing FL schemes without compromising model accuracy.

Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning (ML) workloads deployed in warehouse-scale computing (WSC) settings, also known as ML fleets. As the computational demands placed on ML fleets have increased due to the rise of large models and growing demand for ML applications, it has become increasingly critical to measure and improve the efficiency of such systems. However, there is not yet an established methodology to characterize ML fleet performance and identify potential performance optimizations accordingly. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of an ML fleet based on Google's TPUs, introducing a framework to capture fleet-wide efficiency, systematically evaluate performance characteristics, and identify optimization strategies for the fleet. We begin by defining an ML fleet, outlining its components, and analyzing an example Google ML fleet in production comprising thousands of accelerators running diverse workloads. Our study reveals several critical insights: first, ML fleets extend beyond the hardware layer, with model, data, framework, compiler, and scheduling layers significantly impacting performance; second, the heterogeneous nature of ML fleets poses challenges in characterizing individual workload performance; and third, traditional utilization-based metrics prove insufficient for ML fleet characterization. To address these challenges, we present the "ML Productivity Goodput" (MPG) metric to measure ML fleet efficiency. We show how to leverage this metric to characterize the fleet across the ML system stack. We also present methods to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks using MPG, providing strategies for managing warehouse-scale ML systems in general. Lastly, we demonstrate quantitative evaluations from applying these methods to a real ML fleet for internal-facing Google TPU workloads, where we observed tangible improvements.

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source language model that achieves state-of-the-art (as of April 5 2025) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. A key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, which we address through the following approaches. First, we train LLMs to convert natural language math problems from the Numina dataset to equivalent formal statements in Lean 4. This process creates the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1, which includes 1.64 million formal statements. Next, we develop a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each new prover can prove many statements that previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. Finally, we obtain the dataset Goedel-Pset-v1-solved, which contains proofs for over 800K statements from Goedel-Pset-v1. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base on Goedel-Pset-v1-solved (i.e., no RL) yields a Goedel-Prover-SFT that achieves a success rate of 57.6% (Pass@32) on miniF2F, surpassing the previous leader DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL (trained using SFT + RL on a proprietary dataset) by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover-SFT successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. We provide extensive discussion of our training methodology, highlighting the key design choices that contribute to Goedel-Prover's strong performance. Further RL training (including DPO) improves Goedel-Prover-SFT's success rate to over 60% (Pass@32) on miniF2F.
  To aid future research, we provide extensive discussion of our training methodology and design choices. We also fully open-source our codes, models, and datasets. Additionally, we open-source formal proofs for 29.7K problems in Lean Workbook, nearly doubling the 15.7K solved by prior provers.

Abstract: Machine learning systems trained on electronic health records (EHRs) increasingly guide treatment decisions, but their reliability depends on the critical assumption that patients follow the prescribed treatments recorded in EHRs. Using EHR data from 3,623 hypertension patients, we investigate how treatment non-adherence introduces implicit bias that can fundamentally distort both causal inference and predictive modeling. By extracting patient adherence information from clinical notes using a large language model (LLM), we identify 786 patients (21.7%) with medication non-adherence. We further uncover key demographic and clinical factors associated with non-adherence, as well as patient-reported reasons including side effects and difficulties obtaining refills. Our findings demonstrate that this implicit bias can not only reverse estimated treatment effects, but also degrade model performance by up to 5% while disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations by exacerbating disparities in decision outcomes and model error rates. This highlights the importance of accounting for treatment non-adherence in developing responsible and equitable clinical machine learning systems.

Abstract: Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

Abstract: A generative modeling framework is proposed that combines diffusion models and manifold learning to efficiently sample data densities on manifolds. The approach utilizes Diffusion Maps to uncover possible low-dimensional underlying (latent) spaces in the high-dimensional data (ambient) space. Two approaches for sampling from the latent data density are described. The first is a score-based diffusion model, which is trained to map a standard normal distribution to the latent data distribution using a neural network. The second one involves solving an It\^o stochastic differential equation in the latent space. Additional realizations of the data are generated by lifting the samples back to the ambient space using Double Diffusion Maps, a recently introduced technique typically employed in studying dynamical system reduction; here the focus lies in sampling densities rather than system dynamics. The proposed approaches enable sampling high dimensional data densities restricted to low-dimensional, a priori unknown manifolds. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a benchmark problem and a material with multiscale structure.

Abstract: This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, large language models lack elementary safety features, and this makes them susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause for the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a method, ASIDE, that allows the model to clearly separate between instructions and data on the level of embeddings. ASIDE applies a fixed orthogonal rotation to the embeddings of data tokens, thus creating distinct representations of instructions and data tokens without introducing any additional parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by instruct-tuning LLMs with ASIDE and showing (1) highly increased instruction-data separation scores without a loss in model capabilities and (2) competitive results on prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we study the working mechanism behind our method through an analysis of model representations.

Abstract: Predicting air traffic congestion and flow management is essential for airlines and Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP) to enhance operational efficiency. Accurate estimates of future airport capacity and airspace density are vital for better airspace management, reducing air traffic controller workload and fuel consumption, ultimately promoting sustainable aviation. While existing literature has addressed these challenges, data management and query processing remain complex due to the vast volume of high-rate air traffic data. Many analytics use cases require a common pre-processing infrastructure, as ad-hoc approaches are insufficient. Additionally, linear prediction models often fall short, necessitating more advanced techniques.
  This paper presents a data processing and predictive services architecture that ingests large, uncorrelated, and noisy streaming data to forecast future airspace system states. The system continuously collects raw data, periodically compresses it, and stores it in NoSQL databases for efficient query processing. For prediction, the system learns from historical traffic by extracting key features such as airport arrival and departure events, sector boundary crossings, weather parameters, and other air traffic data. These features are input into various regression models, including linear, non-linear, and ensemble models, with the best-performing model selected for predictions. We evaluate this infrastructure across three prediction use cases in the US National Airspace System (NAS) and a segment of European airspace, using extensive real operations data, confirming that our system can predict future system states efficiently and accurately.

In addition, it matches or exceeds baselines on in-distribution tasks, provides better initializations for classifier training, and is performant on out-of-distribution few-shot tasks while having a fine-tuning mechanism to improve performance.

Abstract: In federated learning, fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models poses significant challenges, particularly regarding high communication cost and suboptimal model performance due to data heterogeneity between the clients. To address these issues, this paper introduces communication-efficient federated LoRA adaption (CE-LoRA), a method that employs a tri-factorization low-rank adaptation approach with personalized model parameter aggregation. We first presents a novel LoRA parameter factorization by introducing a small-size dense matrix, which can significantly reduce the communication cost and achieve comparable empirical performance than transferring the low-rank parameter matrix used by existing methods. Without violating data privacy, the server considers the client similarity in both training dataset and model parameter space, and learns personalized weights for model aggregation. Our experiments on various LLM and VLM fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that CE-LoRA not only significantly reduces communication overhead but also improves performance under not independently and identically distributed data conditions. In addition, CE-LoRA improves data privacy protection, effectively mitigating gradient-based data reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: We introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) designed to operate in hyperbolic spaces, leveraging the Lorentzian model to enhance graph representation learning. Existing GNNs primarily operate in Euclidean spaces, which can limit their ability to capture hierarchical and multi-relational structures inherent to complex graphs. LGIN addresses this by incorporating curvature-aware aggregation functions that preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor, ensuring embeddings remain constrained within the hyperbolic space by proposing a new update rule that effectively captures both local neighborhood interactions and global structural properties, enabling LGIN to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs with expressiveness at least as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Through extensive evaluation across nine benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures, LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art GNNs, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in modeling complex graph structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extend the concept of a powerful graph neural network to Riemannian manifolds, paving the way for future advancements in hyperbolic graph learning.

Abstract: Background. Infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19, continue to be a significant global health issue. Although many countries have reduced or stopped large-scale testing measures, the detection of such diseases remains a propriety. Objective. This study aims to develop a novel, lightweight deep neural network for efficient, accurate, and cost-effective detection of COVID-19 using a nasal breathing audio data collected via smartphones. Methodology. Nasal breathing audio from 128 patients diagnosed with the Omicron variant was collected. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), a widely used feature in speech and sound analysis, were employed for extracting important characteristics from the audio signals. Additional feature selection was performed using Random Forest (RF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. A Dense-ReLU-Dropout model was trained with K-fold cross-validation (K=3), and performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the model. Results. The proposed model achieved 97% accuracy in detecting COVID-19 from nasal breathing sounds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as those by [23] and [13]. Our Dense-ReLU-Dropout model, using RF and PCA for feature selection, achieves high accuracy with greater computational efficiency compared to existing methods that require more complex models or larger datasets. Conclusion. The findings suggest that the proposed method holds significant potential for clinical implementation, advancing smartphone-based diagnostics in infectious diseases. The Dense-ReLU-Dropout model, combined with innovative feature processing techniques, offers a promising approach for efficient and accurate COVID-19 detection, showcasing the capabilities of mobile device-based diagnostics

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has successfully scaled up models while maintaining nearly constant computing costs. By employing a gating network to route input tokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the corresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is challenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation, which leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and insufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by numerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level. Previous works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized by the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to static execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at runtime. In this paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a higher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies: expert collaboration and specialization where some experts tend to activate broadly with others (collaborative), while others are more likely to activate only with a specific subset of experts (specialized). Our experiments reveal that most experts tend to be overly collaborative, leading to increased communication overhead from repeatedly sending tokens to different accelerators. To this end, we propose a novel collaboration-constrained routing (C2R) strategy to encourage more specialized expert groups, as well as to improve expert utilization, and present an efficient implementation of MoE that further leverages expert specialization. We achieve an average performance improvement of 0.51% and 0.33% on LLaMA-MoE and Qwen-MoE respectively across ten downstream NLP benchmarks, and reduce the all2all communication costs between GPUs, bringing an extra 20%-30% total running time savings on top of the existing SoTA, i.e. MegaBlocks.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows. Software and experimental code are publicly available at https://github.com/inEXASCALE/pychop.

Abstract: The predictions of click through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR) play a crucial role in the success of ad-recommendation systems. A Deep Hierarchical Ensemble Network (DHEN) has been proposed to integrate multiple feature crossing modules and has achieved great success in CTR prediction. However, its performance for CVR prediction is unclear in the conversion ads setting, where an ad bids for the probability of a user's off-site actions on a third party website or app, including purchase, add to cart, sign up, etc. A few challenges in DHEN: 1) What feature-crossing modules (MLP, DCN, Transformer, to name a few) should be included in DHEN? 2) How deep and wide should DHEN be to achieve the best trade-off between efficiency and efficacy? 3) What hyper-parameters to choose in each feature-crossing module? Orthogonal to the model architecture, the input personalization features also significantly impact model performance with a high degree of freedom. In this paper, we attack this problem and present our contributions biased to the applied data science side, including:
  First, we propose a multitask learning framework with DHEN as the single backbone model architecture to predict all CVR tasks, with a detailed study on how to make DHEN work effectively in practice; Second, we build both on-site real-time user behavior sequences and off-site conversion event sequences for CVR prediction purposes, and conduct ablation study on its importance; Last but not least, we propose a self-supervised auxiliary loss to predict future actions in the input sequence, to help resolve the label sparseness issue in CVR prediction.
  Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous single feature crossing modules with pre-trained user personalization features.

Abstract: Subseasonal forecasting serves as an important support for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as climate challenges, agricultural yield and sustainable energy production. However, subseasonal forecasting is a complex task in meteorology due to dissipating initial conditions and delayed external forces. Although AI models are increasingly pushing the boundaries of this forecasting limit, they face two major challenges: error accumulation and Smoothness. To address these two challenges, we propose Climate Furnace Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (TianQuan-Climate), a novel machine learning model designed to provide global daily mean forecasts up to 45 days, covering five upper-air atmospheric variables at 13 pressure levels and two surface variables. Our proposed TianQuan-Climate has two advantages: 1) it utilizes a multi-model prediction strategy to reduce system error impacts in long-term subseasonal forecasts; 2) it incorporates a Content Fusion Module for climatological integration and extends ViT with uncertainty blocks (UD-ViT) to improve generalization by learning from uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TianQuan-Climate on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections within the 15 to 45-day range, where TianQuan-Climate outperforms existing numerical and AI methods.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites have promoted the application of large remote sensing foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%.

Abstract: We propose a score-based generative algorithm for sampling from power-scaled priors and likelihoods within the Bayesian inference framework. Our algorithm enables flexible control over prior-likelihood influence without requiring retraining for different power-scaling configurations. Specifically, we focus on synthesizing seismic velocity models conditioned on imaged seismic. Our method enables sensitivity analysis by sampling from intermediate power posteriors, allowing us to assess the relative influence of the prior and likelihood on samples of the posterior distribution. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we evaluate the effects of varying the power parameter in different settings: applying it solely to the prior, to the likelihood of a Bayesian formulation, and to both simultaneously. The results show that increasing the power of the likelihood up to a certain threshold improves the fidelity of posterior samples to the conditioning data (e.g., seismic images), while decreasing the prior power promotes greater structural diversity among samples. Moreover, we find that moderate scaling of the likelihood leads to a reduced shot data residual, confirming its utility in posterior refinement.

Abstract: Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Model misspecification can create significant challenges for the implementation of probabilistic models, and this has led to development of a range of robust methods which directly account for this issue. However, whether these more involved methods are required will depend on whether the model is really misspecified, and there is a lack of generally applicable methods to answer this question. In this paper, we propose one such method. More precisely, we propose kernel-based hypothesis tests for the challenging composite testing problem, where we are interested in whether the data comes from any distribution in some parametric family. Our tests make use of minimum distance estimators based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the kernel Stein discrepancy. They are widely applicable, including whenever the density of the parametric model is known up to normalisation constant, or if the model takes the form of a simulator. As our main result, we show that we are able to estimate the parameter and conduct our test on the same data (without data splitting), while maintaining a correct test level. Our approach is illustrated on a range of problems, including testing for goodness-of-fit of an unnormalised non-parametric density model, and an intractable generative model of a biological cellular network.

<title>Preconditioned Gradient Descent for Overparameterized Nonconvex Burer--Monteiro Factorization with Global Optimality Certification</title>

Abstract: We consider using gradient descent to minimize the nonconvex function $f(X)=\phi(XX^{T})$ over an $n\times r$ factor matrix $X$, in which $\phi$ is an underlying smooth convex cost function defined over $n\times n$ matrices. While only a second-order stationary point $X$ can be provably found in reasonable time, if $X$ is additionally rank deficient, then its rank deficiency certifies it as being globally optimal. This way of certifying global optimality necessarily requires the search rank $r$ of the current iterate $X$ to be overparameterized with respect to the rank $r^{\star}$ of the global minimizer $X^{\star}$. Unfortunately, overparameterization significantly slows down the convergence of gradient descent, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r>r^{\star}$, even when $\phi$ is strongly convex. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive preconditioner that restores the convergence rate of gradient descent back to linear in the overparameterized case, while also making it agnostic to possible ill-conditioning in the global minimizer $X^{\star}$.

<title>Online Statistical Inference in Decision-Making with Matrix Context</title>

Abstract: The study of online decision-making problems that leverage contextual information has drawn notable attention due to their significant applications in fields ranging from healthcare to autonomous systems. In modern applications, contextual information can be rich and is often represented as a matrix. Moreover, while existing online decision algorithms mainly focus on reward maximization, less attention has been devoted to statistical inference. To address these gaps, in this work, we consider an online decision-making problem with a matrix context where the true model parameters have a low-rank structure. We propose a fully online procedure to conduct statistical inference with adaptively collected data. The low-rank structure of the model parameter and the adaptive nature of the data collection process make this difficult: standard low-rank estimators are biased and cannot be obtained in a sequential manner while existing inference approaches in sequential decision-making algorithms fail to account for the low-rankness and are also biased. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new online debiasing procedure to simultaneously handle both sources of bias. Our inference framework encompasses both parameter inference and optimal policy value inference. In theory, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed online debiased estimators and prove the validity of the constructed confidence intervals for both inference tasks. Our inference results are built upon a newly developed low-rank stochastic gradient descent estimator and its convergence result, which are also of independent interest.

Abstract: Minimax optimization recently is widely applied in many machine learning tasks such as generative adversarial networks, robust learning and reinforcement learning. In the paper, we study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization with nonsmooth regularization, where the objective function is possibly nonconvex on primal variable $x$, and it is nonconcave and satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on dual variable $y$. Moreover, we propose a class of enhanced momentum-based gradient descent ascent methods (i.e., MSGDA and AdaMSGDA) to solve these stochastic nonconvex-PL minimax problems. In particular, our AdaMSGDA algorithm can use various adaptive learning rates in updating the variables $x$ and $y$ without relying on any specifical types. Theoretically, we prove that our methods have the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ only requiring one sample at each loop in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Some numerical experiments on PL-game and Wasserstein-GAN demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is a rapidly growing field that utilizes smart devices, sensors, and algorithms to automatically classify and identify the actions of individuals within a given environment. These systems have a wide range of applications, including assisting with caring tasks, increasing security, and improving energy efficiency. However, there are several challenges that must be addressed in order to effectively utilize HAR systems in multi-resident environments. One of the key challenges is accurately associating sensor observations with the identities of the individuals involved, which can be particularly difficult when residents are engaging in complex and collaborative activities. This paper provides a brief overview of the design and implementation of HAR systems, including a summary of the various data collection devices and approaches used for human activity identification. It also reviews previous research on the use of these systems in multi-resident environments and offers conclusions on the current state of the art in the field.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing learning models by identifying key portions of input data, particularly in scenarios with limited training samples. Inspired by human perception, we propose that focusing on essential data segments, rather than the entire dataset, can improve the accuracy and reliability of the learning models. However, identifying these critical data segments, or "hard attention finding," is challenging, especially in few-shot learning, due to the scarcity of training data and the complexity of model parameters. To address this, we introduce LaHA, a novel framework that leverages language-guided deep reinforcement learning to identify and utilize informative data regions, thereby improving both interpretability and performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of LaHA.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving machine learning framework, faces significant data-related challenges. For example, the lack of suitable public datasets leads to ineffective information exchange, especially in heterogeneous environments with uneven data distribution. Foundation Models (FMs) offer a promising solution by generating synthetic datasets that mimic client data distributions, aiding model initialization and knowledge sharing among clients. However, the interaction between FMs and FL introduces new attack vectors that remain largely unexplored. This work therefore assesses the backdoor vulnerabilities exploiting FMs, where attackers exploit safety issues in FMs and poison synthetic datasets to compromise the entire system. Unlike traditional attacks, these new threats are characterized by their one-time, external nature, requiring minimal involvement in FL training. Given these uniqueness, current FL defense strategies provide limited robustness against this novel attack approach. Extensive experiments across image and text domains reveal the high susceptibility of FL to these novel threats, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced security measures in FL in the era of FMs.

Abstract: We study the problem of post-selection predictive inference in an online fashion. To avoid devoting resources to unimportant units, a preliminary selection of the current individual before reporting its prediction interval is common and meaningful in online predictive tasks. Since the online selection causes a temporal multiplicity in the selected prediction intervals, it is important to control the real-time false coverage-statement rate (FCR) which measures the overall miscoverage level. We develop a general framework named CAP (Calibration after Adaptive Pick) that performs an adaptive pick rule on historical data to construct a calibration set if the current individual is selected and then outputs a conformal prediction interval for the unobserved label. We provide tractable procedures for constructing the calibration set for popular online selection rules. We proved that CAP can achieve an exact selection-conditional coverage guarantee in the finite-sample and distribution-free regimes. To account for the distribution shift in online data, we also embed CAP into some recent dynamic conformal prediction algorithms and show that the proposed method can deliver long-run FCR control. Numerical results on both synthetic and real data corroborate that CAP can effectively control FCR around the target level and yield more narrowed prediction intervals over existing baselines across various settings.

Abstract: While Online Gradient Descent and other no-regret learning procedures are known to efficiently converge to a coarse correlated equilibrium in games where each agent's utility is concave in their own strategy, this is not the case when utilities are non-concave -- a common scenario in machine learning applications involving strategies parameterized by deep neural networks, or when agents' utilities are computed by neural networks, or both. Non-concave games introduce significant game-theoretic and optimization challenges: (i) Nash equilibria may not exist; (ii) local Nash equilibria, though they exist, are intractable; and (iii) mixed Nash, correlated, and coarse correlated equilibria generally have infinite support and are intractable. To sidestep these challenges, we revisit the classical solution concept of $\Phi$-equilibria introduced by Greenwald and Jafari [2003], which is guaranteed to exist for an arbitrary set of strategy modifications $\Phi$ even in non-concave games [Stolz and Lugosi, 2007]. However, the tractability of $\Phi$-equilibria in such games remains elusive.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of tractable $\Phi$-equilibria in non-concave games and examine several natural families of strategy modifications. We show that when $\Phi$ is finite, there exists an efficient uncoupled learning algorithm that converges to the corresponding $\Phi$-equilibria. Additionally, we explore cases where $\Phi$ is infinite but consists of local modifications. We show that approximating local $\Phi$-equilibria beyond the first-order stationary regime is computationally intractable. In contrast, within this regime, we show Online Gradient Descent efficiently converges to $\Phi$-equilibria for several natural infinite families of modifications, including a new structural family of modifications inspired by the well-studied proximal operator.

Abstract: The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data extracted from patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. Integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of the clinical condition of a patient, improving diagnosis and treatment decision. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently demonstrate outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit.
  We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex and multi-class Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI tabular data fusion methods. A link to our code can be found at https://github.com/daniel4725/HyperFusion

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as pivotal strategies for attaining quantum advantage in diverse scientific and technological domains, notably within Quantum Neural Networks. However, despite their potential, VQAs encounter significant obstacles, chief among them being the vanishing gradient problem, commonly referred to as barren plateaus. In this article, through meticulous analysis, we demonstrate that existing literature implicitly suggests the intrinsic influence of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. To instantiate these findings, we present numerical results that exemplify the impact of qudit dimensionality on barren plateaus. Therefore, despite the proposition of various error mitigation techniques, our results call for further scrutiny about their efficacy in the context of VQAs with qudits.

Abstract: We consider the solvable neural scaling model with three parameters: data complexity, target complexity, and model-parameter-count. We use this neural scaling model to derive new predictions about the compute-limited, infinite-data scaling law regime. To train the neural scaling model, we run one-pass stochastic gradient descent on a mean-squared loss. We derive a representation of the loss curves which holds over all iteration counts and improves in accuracy as the model parameter count grows. We then analyze the compute-optimal model-parameter-count, and identify 4 phases (+3 subphases) in the data-complexity/target-complexity phase-plane. The phase boundaries are determined by the relative importance of model capacity, optimizer noise, and embedding of the features. We furthermore derive, with mathematical proof and extensive numerical evidence, the scaling-law exponents in all of these phases, in particular computing the optimal model-parameter-count as a function of floating point operation budget.

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) task involves predicting the next item a user is likely to interact with, given their past interactions. The SR models examine the sequence of a user's actions to discern more complex behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. Recent research demonstrates the great impact of LLMs on sequential recommendation systems, either viewing sequential recommendation as language modeling or serving as the backbone for user representation. Although these methods deliver outstanding performance, there is scant evidence of the necessity of a large language model and how large the language model is needed, especially in the sequential recommendation scene. Meanwhile, due to the huge size of LLMs, it is inefficient and impractical to apply a LLM-based model in real-world platforms that often need to process billions of traffic logs daily. In this paper, we explore the influence of LLMs' depth by conducting extensive experiments on large-scale industry datasets. Surprisingly, our motivational experiments reveal that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant, indicating that pruning the remaining layers can still maintain strong performance. Motivated by this insight, we empower small language models for SR, namely SLMRec, which adopt a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method. Moreover, SLMRec is orthogonal to other post-training efficiency techniques, such as quantization and pruning, so that they can be leveraged in combination. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed SLMRec model attains the best performance using only 13% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively. Besides, we provide a theoretical justification for why small language models can perform comparably to large language models in SR.

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model that instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Automated parking stands as a highly anticipated application of autonomous driving technology. However, existing path planning methodologies fall short of addressing this need due to their incapability to handle the diverse and complex parking scenarios in reality. While non-learning methods provide reliable planning results, they are vulnerable to intricate occasions, whereas learning-based ones are good at exploration but unstable in converging to feasible solutions. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask. To facilitate the training and evaluation of the proposed planner, we propose a criterion for categorizing the difficulty level of parking scenarios based on space and obstacle distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms typical rule-based algorithms and traditional reinforcement learning methods, showing higher planning success rates and generalization across various scenarios. We also conduct real-world experiments to verify the practicability of HOPE. The code for our solution is openly available on https://github.com/jiamiya/HOPE.

Abstract: Algorithms for bilevel optimization often encounter Hessian computations, which are prohibitive in high dimensions. While recent works offer first-order methods for unconstrained bilevel problems, the constrained setting remains relatively underexplored. We present first-order linearly constrained optimization methods with finite-time hypergradient stationarity guarantees. For linear equality constraints, we attain $\epsilon$-stationarity in $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ gradient oracle calls, which is nearly-optimal. For linear inequality constraints, we attain $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationarity in $\widetilde{O}(d{\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3}})$ gradient oracle calls, where $d$ is the upper-level dimension. Finally, we obtain for the linear inequality setting dimension-free rates of $\widetilde{O}({\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-4}})$ oracle complexity under the additional assumption of oracle access to the optimal dual variable. Along the way, we develop new nonsmooth nonconvex optimization methods with inexact oracles. We verify these guarantees with preliminary numerical experiments.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) has been a long-standing field to answer questions based on knowledge bases. Recently, the evolving dynamics of knowledge have attracted a growing interest in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA), an emerging task to answer temporal questions. However, this field grapples with ambiguities in defining temporal questions and lacks a systematic categorization of existing methods for TKGQA. In response, this paper provides a thorough survey from two perspectives: the taxonomy of temporal questions and the methodological categorization for TKGQA. Specifically, we first establish a detailed taxonomy of temporal questions engaged in prior studies. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGQA techniques of two categories: semantic parsing-based and TKG embedding-based. Building on this review, the paper outlines potential research directions aimed at advancing the field of TKGQA. This work aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for TKGQA and to stimulate further research.

Abstract: Numerous Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection algorithms have been developed to identify unknown samples or objects in real-world deployments. One line of work related to OOD detection propose utilizing auxiliary datasets to train OOD detectors, thereby enhancing the performance of OOD detection. Recently, researchers propose to leverage Stable Diffusion (SD) to generate outliers in the pixel space, which may complicate network training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an Outlier Aware Learning (OAL) framework, which synthesizes OOD training data in the latent space. This improvement enables us to train the network with only a few synthesized outliers. Besides, to regularize the model's decision boundary, we develop a mutual information-based contrastive learning module (MICL) that amplifies the distinction between In-Distribution (ID) and collected OOD features. Moreover, we develop a knowledge distillation module to prevent the degradation of ID classification accuracy when training with OOD data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

<title>LiveBench: A Challenging, Contamination-Limited LLM Benchmark</title>

arXiv:2406.19314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test set contamination, wherein test data from a benchmark ends up in a newer model's training set, is a well-documented obstacle for fair LLM evaluation and can quickly render benchmarks obsolete. To mitigate this, many recent benchmarks crowdsource new prompts and evaluations from human or LLM judges; however, these can introduce significant biases, and break down when scoring hard questions. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for LLMs designed to be resistant to both test set contamination and the pitfalls of LLM judging and human crowdsourcing. We release LiveBench, the first benchmark that (1) contains frequently-updated questions from recent information sources, (2) scores answers automatically according to objective ground-truth values, and (3) contains a wide variety of challenging tasks, spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis. To achieve this, LiveBench contains questions that are based on recently-released math competitions, arXiv papers, news articles, and datasets, and it contains harder, contamination-limited versions of tasks from previous benchmarks such as Big-Bench Hard, AMPS, and IFEval. We evaluate many prominent closed-source models, as well as dozens of open-source models ranging from 0.5B to 405B in size. LiveBench is difficult, with top models achieving below 70% accuracy. We release all questions, code, and model answers. Questions are added and updated on a monthly basis, and we release new tasks and harder versions of tasks over time so that LiveBench can distinguish between the capabilities of LLMs as they improve in the future. We welcome community engagement and collaboration for expanding the benchmark tasks and models.

Abstract: We study a fundamental problem in the evaluation of large language models that we call training on the test task. Unlike wrongful practices like training on the test data, leakage, or data contamination, training on the test task is not a malpractice. Rather, the term describes a growing set of practices that utilize knowledge about evaluation tasks at training time. We demonstrate that training on the test task confounds both relative model evaluations and claims about emergent capabilities. We argue that the seeming superiority of one model family over another may be explained by a different degree of training on the test task. To this end, we propose an effective method to adjust for the effect of training on the test task on benchmark evaluations. Put simply, to fine-tune each model under comparison on the same task-relevant data prior to evaluation. We then show that instances of emergent behavior disappear gradually as models train on the test task. Our work promotes a new perspective on the evaluation of large language models, with broad implications for benchmarking and the study of emergent capabilities.

<title>Distributed computing for physics-based data-driven reduced modeling at scale: Application to a rotating detonation rocket engine</title>

Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) has revolutionized our ability to perform detailed simulations of complex real-world processes. A prominent contemporary example is from aerospace propulsion, where HPC is used for rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) simulations in support of the design of next-generation rocket engines; however, these simulations take millions of core hours even on powerful supercomputers, which makes them impractical for engineering tasks like design exploration and risk assessment. Data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) aim to address this limitation by constructing computationally cheap yet sufficiently accurate approximations that serve as surrogates for the high-fidelity model. This paper contributes a distributed memory algorithm that achieves fast and scalable construction of predictive physics-based ROMs trained from sparse datasets of extremely large state dimension. The algorithm learns structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets.This enables model reduction for problems at a scale and complexity that exceeds the capabilities of standard, serial approaches. We demonstrate our algorithm's scalability using up to $2,048$ cores on the Frontera supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. We focus on a real-world three-dimensional RDRE for which one millisecond of simulated physical time requires one million core hours on a supercomputer. Using a training dataset of $2,536$ snapshots each of state dimension $76$ million, our distributed algorithm enables the construction of a predictive data-driven reduced model in just $13$ seconds on $2,048$ cores on Frontera.

Abstract: We show that many perception tasks, from visual recognition, semantic segmentation, optical flow, depth estimation to vocalization discrimination, are highly redundant functions of their input data. Images or spectrograms, projected into different subspaces, formed by orthogonal bases in pixel, Fourier or wavelet domains, can be used to solve these tasks remarkably well regardless of whether it is the top subspace where data varies the most, some intermediate subspace with moderate variability--or the bottom subspace where data varies the least. This phenomenon occurs because different subspaces have a large degree of redundant information relevant to the task.

Abstract: Research on multi-modal contrastive learning strategies for audio and text has rapidly gained interest. Contrastively trained Audio-Language Models (ALMs), such as CLAP, which establish a unified representation across audio and language modalities, have enhanced the efficacy in various subsequent tasks by providing good text aligned audio encoders and vice versa. These improvements are evident in areas like zero-shot audio classification and audio retrieval, among others. However, the ability of these models to understand natural language and temporal relations is still a largely unexplored and open field for research. In this paper, we propose to equip the multi-modal ALMs with temporal understanding without loosing their inherent prior capabilities of audio-language tasks with a temporal instillation method TeminAL. We implement a two-stage training scheme TeminAL A $\&$ B, where the model first learns to differentiate between multiple sounds in TeminAL A, followed by a phase that instills a sense of time, thereby enhancing its temporal understanding in TeminAL B. This approach results in an average performance gain of $5.28\%$ in temporal understanding on the ESC-50 dataset, while the model remains competitive in zero-shot retrieval and classification tasks on the AudioCap/Clotho datasets. We also note the lack of proper evaluation techniques for contrastive ALMs and propose a strategy for evaluating ALMs in zero-shot settings. The general-purpose zero-shot model evaluation strategy ZSTE, is used to evaluate various prior models. ZSTE demonstrates a general strategy to evaluate all ZS contrastive models. The model trained with TeminAL successfully outperforms current models on most downstream tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven significant progress in learning from single-subject, iconic images. However, there are still unanswered questions about the use of minimally-curated, naturalistic video data, which contain dense scenes with many independent objects, imbalanced class distributions, and varying object sizes. In this paper, we propose PooDLe, a self-supervised learning method that combines an invariance-based objective on pooled representations with a dense SSL objective that enforces equivariance to optical flow warping. Our results show that a unified objective applied at multiple feature scales is essential for learning effective image representations from naturalistic videos. We validate our method with experiments on the BDD100K driving video dataset and the Walking Tours first-person video dataset, demonstrating its ability to capture spatial understanding from a dense objective and semantic understanding via a pooled representation objective.

<title>Task-Specific Directions: Definition, Exploration, and Utilization in Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet they require extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs), which are critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Additionally, based on our exploration of TSD, we focus on an important issue in PEFT: the initialization of LoRA. While some works have pointed out the significance of initialization for LoRA's performance and proposed various strategies, these methods are often empirical and not task-specific. To address this issue, we propose LoRA-Init. Starting from TSD, we identify the directions that require the most adjustment during fine-tuning for downstream tasks. By initializing the matrices in LoRA with these directions, LoRA-Init significantly enhances LoRA's performance. Moreover, we can combine LoRA-Dash and LoRA-Init to create the final version of LoRA based on TSDs, which we refer to as LoRA-TSD. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms behind their success.

arXiv:2409.02871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the release of open source datasets such as nuPlan and Argoverse, the research around learning-based planners has spread a lot in the last years. Existing systems have shown excellent capabilities in imitating the human driver behaviour, but they struggle to guarantee safe closed-loop driving. Conversely, optimization-based planners offer greater security in short-term planning scenarios. To confront this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel hybrid motion planner that integrates both learning-based and optimization-based techniques. Initially, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) generates a human-like trajectory, which is then refined by an optimization-based component. This component not only minimizes tracking errors but also computes a trajectory that is both kinematically feasible and collision-free with obstacles and road boundaries. Our model effectively balances safety and human-likeness, mitigating the trade-off inherent in these objectives. We validate our approach through simulation experiments and further demonstrate its efficacy by deploying it in real-world self-driving vehicles.

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful image transformations (i.e. rotation, thickness, blur) directly from examples can be a challenging task. Recently, the Manifold Autoencoder (MAE) proposed using a set of Lie group operators to learn image transformations directly from examples. However, this approach has limitations, as the learned operators are not guaranteed to be disentangled and the training routine is prohibitively expensive when scaling up the model. To address these limitations, we propose MANGO (transformation Manifolds with Grouped Operators) for learning disentangled operators that describe image transformations in distinct latent subspaces. Moreover, our approach allows practitioners the ability to define which transformations they aim to model, thus improving the semantic meaning of the learned operators. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that MANGO enables composition of image transformations and introduces a one-phase training routine that leads to a 100x speedup over prior works.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

Abstract: Classical generative diffusion models learn an isotropic Gaussian denoising process, treating all spatial regions uniformly, thus neglecting potentially valuable structural information in the data. Inspired by the long-established work on anisotropic diffusion in image processing, we present a novel edge-preserving diffusion model that generalizes over existing isotropic models by considering a hybrid noise scheme. In particular, we introduce an edge-aware noise scheduler that varies between edge-preserving and isotropic Gaussian noise. We show that our model's generative process converges faster to results that more closely match the target distribution. We demonstrate its capability to better learn the low-to-mid frequencies within the dataset, which plays a crucial role in representing shapes and structural information. Our edge-preserving diffusion process consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unconditional image generation. It is also particularly more robust for generative tasks guided by a shape-based prior, such as stroke-to-image generation. We present qualitative and quantitative results (FID and CLIP score) showing consistent improvements of up to 30% for both tasks.

Abstract: We present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image. Extensive experiments analyze specific design choices and demonstrate that Depth Pro outperforms prior work along multiple dimensions.

<title>From Imitation to Exploration: End-to-end Autonomous Driving based on World Model</title>

arXiv:2410.02253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end autonomous driving architectures have gained increasing attention due to their advantage in avoiding error accumulation. Most existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods are based on Imitation Learning (IL), which can quickly derive driving strategies by mimicking expert behaviors. However, IL often struggles to handle scenarios outside the training dataset, especially in high-dynamic and interaction-intensive traffic environments. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based driving models can optimize driving decisions through interaction with the environment, improving adaptability and robustness.
  To leverage the strengths of both IL and RL, we propose RAMBLE, an end-to-end world model-based RL method for driving decision-making. RAMBLE extracts environmental context information from RGB images and LiDAR data through an asymmetrical variational autoencoder. A transformer-based architecture is then used to capture the dynamic transitions of traffic participants. Next, an actor-critic structure reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to derive driving strategies based on the latent features of the current state and dynamics. To accelerate policy convergence and ensure stable training, we introduce a training scheme that initializes the policy network using IL, and employs KL loss and soft update mechanisms to smoothly transition the model from IL to RL.
  RAMBLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in route completion rate on the CARLA Leaderboard 1.0 and completes all 38 scenarios on the CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex and dynamic traffic scenarios. The model will be open-sourced upon paper acceptance at https://github.com/SCP-CN-001/ramble to support further research and development in autonomous driving.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models has grown parallel to the opacity of their training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data was used to train a model. They offer valuable insights into detecting data contamination and ensuring compliance with privacy and copyright standards. However, MIA for LLMs is challenging due to the massive scale of training data and the inherent ambiguity of membership in texts. Moreover, creating realistic MIA evaluation benchmarks is difficult as training and test data distributions are often unknown. We introduce EM-MIA, a novel membership inference method that iteratively refines membership scores and prefix scores via an expectation-maximization algorithm. Our approach leverages the observation that these scores can improve each other: membership scores help identify effective prefixes for detecting training data, while prefix scores help determine membership. As a result, EM-MIA achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiMIA. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we introduce OLMoMIA, a benchmark built from OLMo resources, which allows controlling task difficulty through varying degrees of overlap between training and test data distributions. Our experiments demonstrate EM-MIA is robust across different scenarios while also revealing fundamental limitations of current MIA approaches when member and non-member distributions are nearly identical.

arXiv:2410.09300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose nudging, a simple, plug-and-play, and training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. Nudging is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, nudging employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high. We evaluate nudging across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7x-14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, nudging enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-2-7b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment.

Abstract: Prompt learning has proven effective in adapting vision language models for downstream tasks. However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a "concept - attribute - description" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the zero-shot base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, as well as few-shot classification across 11 diverse datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/HHenryD/TAP.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of RNA properties, such as stability and interactions, is crucial for advancing our understanding of biological processes and developing RNA-based therapeutics. RNA structures can be represented as 1D sequences, 2D topological graphs, or 3D all-atom models, each offering different insights into its function. Existing works predominantly focus on 1D sequence-based models, which overlook the geometric context provided by 2D and 3D geometries. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of incorporating explicit 2D and 3D geometric information into RNA property prediction, considering not only performance but also real-world challenges such as limited data availability, partial labeling, sequencing noise, and computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce a newly curated set of RNA datasets with enhanced 2D and 3D structural annotations, providing a resource for model evaluation on RNA data. Our findings reveal that models with explicit geometry encoding generally outperform sequence-based models, with an average prediction RMSE reduction of around 12% across all various RNA tasks and excelling in low-data and partial labeling regimes, underscoring the value of explicitly incorporating geometric context. On the other hand, geometry-unaware sequence-based models are more robust under sequencing noise but often require around $2-5\times$ training data to match the performance of geometry-aware models. Our study offers further insights into the trade-offs between different RNA representations in practical applications and addresses a significant gap in evaluating deep learning models for RNA tasks.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the de facto privacy standard against privacy leakage attacks, including many recently discovered ones against large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that LLMs could reconstruct the altered/removed privacy from given DP-sanitized prompts. We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP. The experimental results show promising recovery rates, e.g., the black-box attacks against the word-level DP over WikiMIA dataset gave 72.18% on LLaMA-2 (70B), 82.39% on LLaMA-3 (70B), 75.35% on Gemma-2, 91.2% on ChatGPT-4o, and 94.01% on Claude-3.5 (Sonnet). More urgently, this study indicates that these well-known LLMs have emerged as a new security risk for existing DP text sanitization approaches in the current environment.

<title>Contractivity and linear convergence in bilinear saddle-point problems: An operator-theoretic approach</title>

Abstract: We study the convex-concave bilinear saddle-point problem $\min_x \max_y f(x) + y^\top Ax - g(y)$, where both, only one, or none of the functions $f$ and $g$ are strongly convex, and suitable rank conditions on the matrix $A$ hold. The solution of this problem is at the core of many machine learning tasks. By employing tools from monotone operator theory, we systematically prove the contractivity (in turn, the linear convergence) of several first-order primal-dual algorithms, including the Chambolle-Pock method. Our approach results in concise proofs, and it yields new convergence guarantees and tighter bounds compared to known results.

Abstract: Multilingual LLMs support a variety of languages; however, their performance is suboptimal for low-resource languages. In this work, we emphasize the importance of continued pre-training of multilingual LLMs and the use of translation-based synthetic pre-training corpora for improving LLMs in low-resource languages. We conduct our study in the context of the low-resource Indic language Hindi. We introduce Nemotron-Mini-Hindi 4B, a bilingual SLM supporting both Hindi and English, based on Nemotron-Mini 4B. The model is trained using a mix of real and synthetic Hindi + English tokens, with continuous pre-training performed on 400B tokens. We demonstrate that both the base and instruct models achieve state-of-the-art results on Hindi benchmarks while remaining competitive on English tasks. Additionally, we observe that the continued pre-training approach enhances the model's overall factual accuracy. We perform an ablation study to highlight the impact of Hindi pre-training, showing significant improvements in Hindi chat capabilities and factual accuracy, which cannot be achieved through Hindi alignment alone.

<title>CTINexus: Automatic Cyber Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph Construction Using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Textual descriptions in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, such as security articles and news, are rich sources of knowledge about cyber threats, crucial for organizations to stay informed about the rapidly evolving threat landscape. However, current CTI knowledge extraction methods lack flexibility and generalizability, often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete knowledge extraction. Syntax parsing relies on fixed rules and dictionaries, while model fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets, making both paradigms challenging to adapt to new threats and ontologies. To bridge the gap, we propose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge extraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction. Unlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter tuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples. This is achieved through: (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt construction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a wide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity alignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes redundancy; (3) an long-distance relation prediction technique to further complete the CSKG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150 real-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and complete CSKG, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an efficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.

Abstract: We present context parallelism for long-context large language model inference, which achieves near-linear scaling for long-context prefill latency with up to 128 H100 GPUs across 16 nodes. Particularly, our method achieves 1M context prefill with Llama3 405B model in 77s (93% parallelization efficiency, 63% FLOPS utilization) and 128K context prefill in 3.8s. We develop two lossless exact ring attention variants: pass-KV and pass-Q to cover a wide range of use cases with the state-of-the-art performance: full prefill, persistent KV prefill and decode. Benchmarks on H100 GPU hosts inter-connected with RDMA and TCP both show similar scalability for long-context prefill, demonstrating that our method scales well using common commercial data center with medium-to-low inter-host bandwidth.

<title>Inference Optimal VLMs Need Fewer Visual Tokens and More Parameters</title>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks, driven by incorporating image representations into the token inputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to the substantial compute required by the LLM to process the large number of input tokens, predominantly arising from the image. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input tokens needed to represent the image, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent efforts around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is given a fixed inference budget. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs is achieved by using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take the first steps toward designing token compression algorithms tailored for high-compression settings, utilizing prompt-based compression of tokens. Our work underscores the performance and efficiency benefits of operating in low visual token regimes and the importance of developing tailored token reduction algorithms for such conditions. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llava-token-compression.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capability in language generation and understanding, but their tendency to hallucinate and produce factually incorrect information remains a key limitation. To verify LLM-generated contents and claims from other sources, traditional verification approaches often rely on holistic models that assign a single factuality label to complex claims, potentially obscuring nuanced errors. In this paper, we advocate for a shift toward fine-grained verification, where complex claims are broken down into smaller sub-claims for individual verification, allowing for more precise identification of inaccuracies, improved transparency, and reduced ambiguity in evidence retrieval. However, generating sub-claims poses challenges, such as maintaining context and ensuring semantic equivalence with respect to the original claim. We introduce FactLens, a benchmark for evaluating fine-grained fact verification, with metrics and automated evaluators of sub-claim quality. The benchmark data is manually curated to ensure high-quality ground truth. Our results show alignment between automated FactLens evaluators and human judgments, and we discuss the impact of sub-claim characteristics on the overall verification performance.

<title>Robust multi-coil MRI reconstruction via self-supervised denoising</title>

Abstract: To examine the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.

Abstract: Inference with Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) on long sequences is both costly and slow due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to localize the image regions based on a textual query. Given the difficulty of large-scale data curation, we investigate how to effectively learn visual grounding under data-scarce settings in this paper. To address the data scarcity, we propose a novel framework, POBF (Paint Outside the Box and Filter). POBF synthesizes images by inpainting outside the box, tackling a label misalignment issue encountered in previous works. Furthermore, POBF leverages an innovative filtering scheme to select the most effective training data. This scheme combines a hardness score and an overfitting score, balanced by a penalty term. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that POBF consistently improves performance, achieving an average gain of 5.83\% over the real-data-only method and outperforming leading baselines by 2.29\%-3.85\% in accuracy. Additionally, we validate the robustness and generalizability of POBF across various generative models, training data sizes, and model architectures.

Abstract: Remote Sensing (RS) data encapsulates rich multi-dimensional information essential for Earth observation. Its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal continuity make it particularly well-suited for developing large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). These models serve as powerful feature extractors, leveraging extensive RS data for pretraining and subsequent fine-tuning in various geoscientific applications. However, existing VFMs in the RS domain often concentrate on specific image characteristics, neglecting the full season-aware potential of RS data. To bridge this gap, we introduce SeaMo, a novel VFM that effectively integrates multimodal and multi-seasonal RS information. SeaMo leverages a masked image modeling framework to fully exploit the spatial, spectral, and seasonal dimensions of RS data. Specifically, we employ unaligned spatial region selection to capture spatial heterogeneity, incorporate multi-source inputs for enhanced multimodal integration, and introduce temporal-multimodal fusion blocks to assimilate seasonal variations effectively. By explicitly modeling the complex, season-dependent attributes of RS data, SeaMo enhances generalization, robustness, and adaptability across geoscientific tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate its superior performance, underscoring its potential as a foundational model for Earth observation.

<title>Toward Sufficient Statistical Power in Algorithmic Bias Assessment: A Test for ABROCA</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic bias is a pressing concern in educational data mining (EDM), as it risks amplifying inequities in learning outcomes. The Area Between ROC Curves (ABROCA) metric is frequently used to measure discrepancies in model performance across demographic groups to quantify overall model fairness. However, its skewed distribution--especially when class or group imbalances exist--makes significance testing challenging. This study investigates ABROCA's distributional properties and contributes robust methods for its significance testing. Specifically, we address (1) whether ABROCA follows any known distribution, (2) how to reliably test for algorithmic bias using ABROCA, and (3) the statistical power achievable with ABROCA-based bias assessments under typical EDM sample specifications. Simulation results confirm that ABROCA does not match standard distributions, including those suited to accommodate skewness. We propose nonparametric randomization tests for ABROCA and demonstrate that reliably detecting bias with ABROCA requires large sample sizes or substantial effect sizes, particularly in imbalanced settings. Findings suggest that ABROCA-based bias evaluations based on sample sizes common in EDM tend to be underpowered, undermining the reliability of conclusions about model fairness. By offering open-source code to simulate power and statistically test ABROCA, this paper aims to foster more reliable statistical testing in EDM research. It supports broader efforts toward replicability and equity in educational modeling.

<title>A Bring-Your-Own-Model Approach for ML-Driven Storage Placement in Warehouse-Scale Computers</title>

arXiv:2501.05651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Storage systems account for a major portion of the total cost of ownership (TCO) of warehouse-scale computers, and thus have a major impact on the overall system's efficiency. Machine learning (ML)-based methods for solving key problems in storage system efficiency, such as data placement, have shown significant promise. However, there are few known practical deployments of such methods. Studying this problem in the context of real-world hyperscale data centers at Google, we identify a number of challenges that we believe cause this lack of practical adoption. Specifically, prior work assumes a monolithic model that resides entirely within the storage layer, an unrealistic assumption in real-world deployments with frequently changing workloads. To address this problem, we introduce a cross-layer approach where workloads instead ''bring their own model''. This strategy moves ML out of the storage system and instead allows each workload to train its own lightweight model at the application layer, capturing the workload's specific characteristics. These small, interpretable models generate predictions that guide a co-designed scheduling heuristic at the storage layer, enabling adaptation to diverse online environments. We build a proof-of-concept of this approach in a production distributed computation framework at Google. Evaluations in a test deployment and large-scale simulation studies using production traces show improvements of as much as 3.47$\times$ in TCO savings compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<title>Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform of Generalized $q$-ary Functions</title>

Abstract: Computing the Fourier transform of a $q$-ary function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which maps $q$-ary sequences to real numbers, is an important problem in mathematics with wide-ranging applications in biology, signal processing, and machine learning. Previous studies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms. However, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more general space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each $\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. Herein, we develop GFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier transform of $f$ with a sample complexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity of $O(Sn \log N)$, and a failure probability that approaches zero as $N=\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \rightarrow \infty$ with $S = N^\delta$ for some $0 \leq \delta < 1$. We show that a noise-robust version of GFast computes the transform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of $O(Sn^2 \log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized $q$-ary functions $8\times$ faster using $16\times$ fewer samples on synthetic experiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and protein fitness models using up to $13\times$ fewer samples compared to existing Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of the models as $q$-ary functions.

<title>Modality Unified Attack for Omni-Modality Person Re-Identification</title>

arXiv:2501.12761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning based person re-identification (re-id) models have been widely employed in surveillance systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that black-box single-modality and cross-modality re-id models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), leaving the robustness of multi-modality re-id models unexplored. Due to the lack of knowledge about the specific type of model deployed in the target black-box surveillance system, we aim to generate modality unified AEs for omni-modality (single-, cross- and multi-modality) re-id models. Specifically, we propose a novel Modality Unified Attack method to train modality-specific adversarial generators to generate AEs that effectively attack different omni-modality models. A multi-modality model is adopted as the surrogate model, wherein the features of each modality are perturbed by metric disruption loss before fusion. To collapse the common features of omni-modality models, Cross Modality Simulated Disruption approach is introduced to mimic the cross-modality feature embeddings by intentionally feeding images to non-corresponding modality-specific subnetworks of the surrogate model. Moreover, Multi Modality Collaborative Disruption strategy is devised to facilitate the attacker to comprehensively corrupt the informative content of person images by leveraging a multi modality feature collaborative metric disruption loss. Extensive experiments show that our MUA method can effectively attack the omni-modality re-id models, achieving 55.9%, 24.4%, 49.0% and 62.7% mean mAP Drop Rate, respectively.

Abstract: The potato is a widely grown crop in many regions of the world. In recent decades, potato farming has gained incredible traction in the world. Potatoes are susceptible to several illnesses that stunt their development. This plant seems to have significant leaf disease. Early Blight and Late Blight are two prevalent leaf diseases that affect potato plants. The early detection of these diseases would be beneficial for enhancing the yield of this crop. The ideal solution is to use image processing to identify and analyze these disorders. Here, we present an autonomous method based on image processing and machine learning to detect late blight disease affecting potato leaves. The proposed method comprises four different phases: (1) Histogram Equalization is used to improve the quality of the input image; (2) feature extraction is performed using a Deep CNN model, then these extracted features are concatenated; (3) feature selection is performed using wrapper-based feature selection; (4) classification is performed using an SVM classifier and its variants. This proposed method achieves the highest accuracy of 99% using SVM by selecting 550 features.

Abstract: Standing-up control is crucial for humanoid robots, with the potential for integration into current locomotion and loco-manipulation systems, such as fall recovery. Existing approaches are either limited to simulations that overlook hardware constraints or rely on predefined ground-specific motion trajectories, failing to enable standing up across postures in real-world scenes. To bridge this gap, we present HoST (Humanoid Standing-up Control), a reinforcement learning framework that learns standing-up control from scratch, enabling robust sim-to-real transfer across diverse postures. HoST effectively learns posture-adaptive motions by leveraging a multi-critic architecture and curriculum-based training on diverse simulated terrains. To ensure successful real-world deployment, we constrain the motion with smoothness regularization and implicit motion speed bound to alleviate oscillatory and violent motions on physical hardware, respectively. After simulation-based training, the learned control policies are directly deployed on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our experimental results demonstrate that the controllers achieve smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a wide range of laboratory and outdoor environments.

Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho<\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s<1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s<\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.

<title>Activation-wise Propagation: A Universal Strategy to Break Timestep Constraints in Spiking Neural Networks for 3D Data Processing</title>

Abstract: Due to their event-driven and parameter-efficient effect, spiking neural networks (SNNs) show potential in tasks requiring real-time multi-sensor perception, such as autonomous driving. The spiking mechanism facilitates sparse encoding, enabling spatial and temporal data to be represented in a discrete manner. However, SNNs still lag behind artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of performance and computational efficiency. One major challenge in SNNs is the timestep-wise iterative update of neuronal states, which makes it difficult to achieve an optimal trade-off among accuracy, latency, and training cost. Although some methods perform well with shorter timesteps, few propose strategies to overcome such constraint effectively. Moreover, many recent SNN advancements rely on either optimizations tailored to specific architectures or a collection of specialized neuron-level strategies. While these approaches can enhance performance, they often lead to increased computational expense and restrict their application to particular architectures or modalities. This leaves room for further exploration of simple, universal, and structure-agnostic strategies that could offer broader applicability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2), a novel state update mechanism for spiking neurons. Inspired by skip connections in deep networks, AMP2 incorporates the membrane potential of neurons into network, eliminating the need for iterative updates. Our method achieves significant improvements across various 3D modalities, including 3D point clouds and event streams, boosting Spiking PointNet's accuracy on ModelNet40 from 87.36% to 89.74% and surpassing ANN PointNet in recognition accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in processing long sequences and complex reasoning tasks, yet efficiently serving these models remains challenging due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention in the prefilling stage and the large memory footprint of the KV cache in the decoding stage. To address these issues, we introduce LServe, an efficient system that accelerates long-sequence LLM serving via hybrid sparse attention. This method unifies different hardware-friendly, structured sparsity patterns for both prefilling and decoding attention into a single framework, where computations on less important tokens are skipped block-wise. LServe demonstrates the compatibility of static and dynamic sparsity in long-context LLM attention. This design enables multiplicative speedups by combining these optimizations. Specifically, we convert half of the attention heads to nearly free streaming heads in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Additionally, we find that only a constant number of KV pages is required to preserve long-context and reasoning capabilities, irrespective of context length. We then design a hierarchical KV page selection policy that dynamically prunes KV pages based on query-centric similarity. On average, LServe accelerates LLM prefilling by up to 2.9x and decoding by 1.3-2.1x over vLLM, maintaining long-context accuracy. Code is released at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/omniserve.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode semantic relationships in high-dimensional vector embeddings. This paper explores the analogy between LLM embedding spaces and quantum mechanics, positing that LLMs operate within a quantized semantic space where words and phrases behave as quantum states. To capture nuanced semantic interference effects, we extend the standard real-valued embedding space to the complex domain, drawing parallels to the double-slit experiment. We introduce a "semantic wave function" to formalize this quantum-derived representation and utilize potential landscapes, such as the double-well potential, to model semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, we propose a complex-valued similarity measure that incorporates both magnitude and phase information, enabling a more sensitive comparison of semantic representations. We develop a path integral formalism, based on a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a gauge field and Mexican hat potential, to model the dynamic evolution of LLM behavior. This interdisciplinary approach offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and potentially manipulating LLMs, with the goal of advancing both artificial and natural language understanding.

Abstract: Consider an edge computing setting in which a user submits queries for the solution of a linear system to an edge processor, which is subject to time-varying computing availability. The edge processor applies a probabilistic linear solver (PLS) so as to be able to respond to the user's query within the allotted time and computing budget. Feedback to the user is in the form of a set of plausible solutions. Due to model misspecification, the highest-probability-density (HPD) set obtained via a direct application of PLS does not come with coverage guarantees with respect to the true solution of the linear system. This work introduces a new method to calibrate the HPD sets produced by PLS with the aim of guaranteeing long-term coverage requirements. The proposed method, referred to as online conformal prediction-PLS (OCP-PLS), assumes sporadic feedback from cloud to edge. This enables the online calibration of uncertainty thresholds via online conformal prediction (OCP), an online optimization method previously studied in the context of prediction models. The validity of OCP-PLS is verified via experiments that bring insights into trade-offs between coverage, prediction set size, and cloud usage.

<title>A Language Anchor-Guided Method for Robust Noisy Domain Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17211</link>

arXiv:2503.17211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often struggle with two major challenges: distribution shift and label noise. Models tend to overfit by focusing on redundant and uninformative features in the training data, which makes it hard for them to generalize to the target domain. Noisy data worsens this problem by causing further overfitting to the noise, meaning that existing methods often fail to tell the difference between true, invariant features and misleading, spurious ones. To tackle these issues, we introduce Anchor Alignment and Adaptive Weighting (A3W). This new algorithm uses sample reweighting guided by natural language processing (NLP) anchors to extract more representative features. In simple terms, A3W leverages semantic representations from natural language models as a source of domain-invariant prior knowledge. Additionally, it employs a weighted loss function that adjusts each sample's contribution based on its similarity to the corresponding NLP anchor. This adjustment makes the model more robust to noisy labels. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that A3W consistently outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, offering significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels.

<title>Rerouting Connection: Hybrid Computer Vision Analysis Reveals Visual Similarity Between Indus and Tibetan-Yi Corridor Writing Systems</title>

arXiv:2503.21074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, alongside a detailed anthropological framework, to investigate potential historical connections between the visual morphology of the Indus Valley script and pictographic systems of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor. Through an ensemble methodology of three target scripts across 15 independently trained models, we demonstrate that Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts exhibit approximately six-fold higher visual similarity to the Indus script (0.635) than to the Bronze Age Proto-Cuneiform (0.102) or Proto-Elamite (0.078).
  Contrary to expectations, when measured through direct script-to-script embedding comparisons, the Indus script maps closer to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts with a mean cosine similarity of 0.930 (CI: [0.917, 0.942]) than to contemporaneous West Asian signaries, which recorded mean similarities of 0.887 (CI: [0.863, 0.911]) and 0.855 (CI: [0.818, 0.891]). Across dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, the Indus script consistently clusters closest to Tibetan-Yi Corridor scripts.
  These computational findings align with observed pictorial parallels in numeral systems, gender markers, and iconographic elements. Archaeological evidence of contact networks along the ancient Shu-Shendu road, coinciding with the Indus Civilization's decline, provides a plausible transmission pathway. While alternate explanations cannot be ruled out, the specificity and consistency of similarities suggest more complex cultural transmission networks between South and East Asia than previously recognized.

Abstract: This paper presents the ZJUKLAB team's submission for SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning Sensitive Content from Large Language Models. This task aims to selectively erase sensitive knowledge from large language models, avoiding both over-forgetting and under-forgetting issues. We propose an unlearning system that leverages Model Merging (specifically TIES-Merging), combining two specialized models into a more balanced unlearned model. Our system achieves competitive results, ranking second among 26 teams, with an online score of 0.944 for Task Aggregate and 0.487 for overall Aggregate. In this paper, we also conduct local experiments and perform a comprehensive analysis of the unlearning process, examining performance trajectories, loss dynamics, and weight perspectives, along with several supplementary experiments, to understand the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we analyze the shortcomings of our method and evaluation metrics, emphasizing that MIA scores and ROUGE-based metrics alone are insufficient to fully evaluate successful unlearning. Finally, we emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation methodologies and rethinking of unlearning objectives in future research.

Abstract: With the growing computational power available for high-resolution ensemble simulations in scientific fields such as cosmology and oceanology, storage and computational demands present significant challenges. Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.

Abstract: The rising demand for energy-efficient edge AI systems (e.g., mobile agents/robots) has increased the interest in neuromorphic computing, since it offers ultra-low power/energy AI computation through spiking neural network (SNN) algorithms on neuromorphic processors. However, their efficient implementation strategy has not been comprehensively studied, hence limiting SNN deployments for edge AI systems. Toward this, we propose a design methodology to enable efficient SNN processing on commodity neuromorphic processors. To do this, we first study the key characteristics of targeted neuromorphic hardware (e.g., memory and compute budgets), and leverage this information to perform compatibility analysis for network selection. Afterward, we employ a mapping strategy for efficient SNN implementation on the targeted processor. Furthermore, we incorporate an efficient on-chip learning mechanism to update the systems' knowledge for adapting to new input classes and dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology leads the system to achieve low latency of inference (i.e., less than 50ms for image classification, less than 200ms for real-time object detection in video streaming, and less than 1ms in keyword recognition) and low latency of on-chip learning (i.e., less than 2ms for keyword recognition), while incurring less than 250mW of processing power and less than 15mJ of energy consumption across the respective different applications and scenarios. These results show the potential of the proposed methodology in enabling efficient edge AI systems for diverse application use-cases.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity and temporally smooth 3D human motion generation remains a challenge, particularly within resource-constrained environments. We introduce FlowMotion, a novel method leveraging Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). FlowMotion incorporates a training objective within CFM that focuses on more accurately predicting target motion in 3D human motion generation, resulting in enhanced generation fidelity and temporal smoothness while maintaining the fast synthesis times characteristic of flow-matching-based methods. FlowMotion achieves state-of-the-art jitter performance, achieving the best jitter in the KIT dataset and the second-best jitter in the HumanML3D dataset, and a competitive FID value in both datasets. This combination provides robust and natural motion sequences, offering a promising equilibrium between generation quality and temporal naturalness.

Abstract: To address the challenges of limited behavioral intelligence and overly simplified vehicle behavior modeling in autonomous driving simulations, this paper proposes the Cognitive Hierarchical Agent for Reasoning and Motion Stylization (CHARMS). Leveraging Level-k game theory, we model human driver decision-making using reinforcement learning pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. This enables the resulting models to exhibit diverse behaviors, improving the intelligence and realism of surrounding vehicles in simulation. Building upon this capability, we further develop a scenario generation framework that utilizes the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory to control the distribution of vehicles with different driving styles through Poisson and binomial sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that CHARMS is capable of both making intelligent decisions as an ego vehicle and generating diverse, realistic driving scenarios as surrounding vehicles. The code for CHARMS will be released at https://github.com/WUTAD-Wjy/CHARMS.

Abstract: Online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) has widespread applications in industrial automation. Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online 3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing configuration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is proportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train and well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover the potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing problems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and different variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to decompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble mechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations with additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline packing, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box problem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various practical constraints. The planning process excels across large-scale problems and diverse problem variations. We develop a real-world packing robot for industrial warehousing, with careful designs accounting for constrained placement and transportation stability. Our packing robot operates reliably and efficiently on unprotected pallets at 10 seconds per box. It achieves averagely 19 boxes per pallet with 57.4% space utilization for relatively large-size boxes.

Abstract: Modeling and reproducing crowd behaviors are important in various domains including psychology, robotics, transport engineering and virtual environments. Conventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have difficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous, realistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions among individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain spatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map, appearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to crowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the timeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents' type, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd simulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it can augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall framework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by alternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the components in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose a benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated crowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level trajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models diverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different geographical environments. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/InhwanBae/CrowdES .

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) is a time-efficient computational paradigm derived from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The Simple Cycle Reservoir (SCR) is an RC model that stands out for its minimalistic design, offering extremely low construction complexity and proven capability of universally approximating time-invariant causal fading memory filters, even in the linear dynamics regime. This paper introduces Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs (MSCRs), a multi-reservoir framework that extends Echo State Networks (ESNs) by replacing a single large reservoir with multiple interconnected SCRs. We demonstrate that optimizing MSCR using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperforms existing multi-reservoir models, achieving competitive predictive performance with a lower-dimensional state space. By modeling interconnections as a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), our approach enables flexible, task-specific network topology adaptation. Numerical simulations on three benchmark time-series prediction tasks confirm these advantages over rival algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of MSCR-PSO as a promising framework for optimizing multi-reservoir systems, providing a foundation for further advancements and applications of interconnected SCRs for developing efficient AI devices.

Abstract: AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that most of the competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.

Abstract: Bias in data collection, arising from both under-reporting and over-reporting, poses significant challenges in critical applications such as healthcare and public safety. In this work, we introduce Graph-based Over- and Under-reporting Debiasing (GROUD), a novel graph-based optimization framework that debiases reported data by jointly estimating the true incident counts and the associated reporting bias probabilities. By modeling the bias as a smooth signal over a graph constructed from geophysical or feature-based similarities, our convex formulation not only ensures a unique solution but also comes with theoretical recovery guarantees under certain assumptions. We validate GROUD on both challenging simulated experiments and real-world datasets -- including Atlanta emergency calls and COVID-19 vaccine adverse event reports -- demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in accurately recovering debiased counts. This approach paves the way for more reliable downstream decision-making in systems affected by reporting irregularities.

Abstract: The rise of LLM-driven AI characters raises safety concerns, particularly for vulnerable human users with psychological disorders. To address these risks, we propose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two components: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying mentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and after interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates, underscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is available at: https://github.com/1akaman/EmoAgent

<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces Modality Incremental Learning (MIL), a paradigm that addresses the challenge of incremental learning across evolving modal sequences. The proposed framework, Harmony, utilizes adaptive compatible feature modulation and cumulative modal bridging to align modalities and retain knowledge, allowing the model to learn from a sequence of distinct modalities within a unified framework. By constructing historical modal features and accumulating modal knowledge, the components of Harmony effectively bridge modal differences and maintain knowledge retention, even with only unimodal data available at each learning stage. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving successful learning across multiple modalities in incremental learning scenarios. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Incremental learning aims to enable models to continuously acquire knowledge from evolving data streams while preserving previously learned capabilities. While current research predominantly focuses on unimodal incremental learning and multimodal incremental learning where the modalities are consistent, real-world scenarios often present data from entirely new modalities, posing additional challenges. This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a unified model capable of incremental learning across continuously evolving modal sequences. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm called Modality Incremental Learning (MIL), where each learning stage involves data from distinct modalities. To address this task, we propose a novel framework named Harmony, designed to achieve modal alignment and knowledge retention, enabling the model to reduce the modal discrepancy and learn from a sequence of distinct modalities, ultimately completing tasks across multiple modalities within a unified framework. Our approach introduces the adaptive compatible feature modulation and cumulative modal bridging. Through constructing historical modal features and performing modal knowledge accumulation and alignment, the proposed components collaboratively bridge modal differences and maintain knowledge retention, even with solely unimodal data available at each learning phase.These components work in concert to establish effective modality connections and maintain knowledge retention, even when only unimodal data is available at each learning stage. Extensive experiments on the MIL task demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing incremental learning methods, validating its effectiveness in MIL scenarios.

<div> Keywords: visual AI models, data-efficient scaling laws, distillation boundary theory, knowledge inheritance, vision model scaling behaviors 

Summary: 
This paper introduces a framework for studying the scaling behavior of visual AI models in data-constrained downstream tasks. The authors investigate how data efficiency impacts scaling behaviors and the efficacy of knowledge distillation. They propose the distillation boundary theory, which identifies a critical turning point in distillation efficiency and pre-training dominance based on data availability. In data-scarce conditions, distilled models outperform non-distilled models by leveraging inherited knowledge efficiently. However, as pre-training data increases, non-distilled models gradually surpass distilled models, indicating diminishing returns from knowledge inheritance. The empirical validation across various model scales and data volumes confirms these performance inflection points, highlighting the importance of understanding vision model scaling behaviors in data-limited regimes. This work bridges the gap between large-scale pretraining and practical downstream adaptation, providing insights for optimizing computational resource allocation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current scaling laws for visual AI models focus predominantly on large-scale pretraining, leaving a critical gap in understanding how performance scales for data-constrained downstream tasks. To address this limitation, this paper establishes the first practical framework for data-efficient scaling laws in visual transfer learning, addressing two fundamental questions: 1) How do scaling behaviors shift when downstream tasks operate with limited data? 2) What governs the efficacy of knowledge distillation under such constraints? Through systematic analysis of vision tasks across data regimes (1K-1M samples), we propose the distillation boundary theory, revealing a critical turning point in distillation efficiency: 1) Distillation superiority: In data-scarce conditions, distilled models significantly outperform their non-distillation counterparts, efficiently leveraging inherited knowledge to compensate for limited training samples. 2) Pre-training dominance: As pre-training data increases beyond a critical threshold, non-distilled models gradually surpass distilled versions, suggesting diminishing returns from knowledge inheritance when sufficient task-specific data becomes available. Empirical validation across various model scales (2.5M to 38M parameters) and data volumes demonstrate these performance inflection points, with error difference curves transitioning from positive to negative values at critical data thresholds, confirming our theoretical predictions. This work redefines scaling laws for data-limited regimes, bridging the knowledge gap between large-scale pretraining and practical downstream adaptation, addressing a critical barrier to understanding vision model scaling behaviors and optimizing computational resource allocation.

<div> neural ordinary differential equations, mean-field game theory, deep learning, data-driven, automatic differentiation
<br />
Mean-field game theory has traditionally relied on analytical solutions that may lead to bias and loss of solution characteristics. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines mean-field game theory with deep learning using neural ordinary differential equations. By integrating deep learning, the model becomes data-driven and lightweight, capable of capturing complex strategic interactions beyond traditional mean-field theory. The use of automatic differentiation enhances robustness and objectivity compared to finite difference-based approaches. The study demonstrates the efficacy and flexibility of this method by applying it to three different mean-field games with varying complexities, observabilities, and noise levels. The results showcase the model's adaptability, efficiency, and ability to learn underlying data distributions with minimal observations.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean-field game theory relies on approximating games that would otherwise have been intractable to model. While the games can be solved analytically via the associated system of partial derivatives, this approach is not model-free, can lead to the loss of the existence or uniqueness of solutions and may suffer from modelling bias. To reduce the dependency between the model and the game, we combine mean-field game theory with deep learning in the form of neural ordinary differential equations. The resulting model is data-driven, lightweight and can learn extensive strategic interactions that are hard to capture using mean-field theory alone. In addition, the model is based on automatic differentiation, making it more robust and objective than approaches based on finite differences. We highlight the efficiency and flexibility of our approach by solving three mean-field games that vary in their complexity, observability and the presence of noise. Using these results, we show that the model is flexible, lightweight and requires few observations to learn the distribution underlying the data.

arXiv:2504.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polysomnography (PSG) signals are essential for studying sleep processes and diagnosing sleep disorders. Analyzing PSG data through deep neural networks (DNNs) for automated sleep monitoring has become increasingly feasible. However, the limited availability of datasets for certain sleep events often leads to DNNs focusing on a single task with a single-sourced training dataset. As a result, these models struggle to transfer to new sleep events and lack robustness when applied to new datasets. To address these challenges, we propose PSG-MAE, a mask autoencoder (MAE) based pre-training framework. By performing self-supervised learning on a large volume of unlabeled PSG data, PSG-MAE develops a robust feature extraction network that can be broadly applied to various sleep event monitoring tasks. Unlike conventional MAEs, PSG-MAE generates complementary masks across PSG channels, integrates a multichannel signal reconstruction method, and employs a self-supervised inter-channel contrastive learning (ICCL) strategy. This approach enables the encoder to capture temporal features from each channel while simultaneously learning latent relationships between channels, thereby enhancing the utilization of multichannel information. Experimental results show that PSG-MAE effectively captures both temporal details and inter-channel information from PSG signals. When the encoder pre-trained through PSG-MAE is fine-tuned with downstream feature decomposition networks, it achieves an accuracy of 83.7% for sleep staging and 90.45% for detecting obstructive sleep apnea, which highlights the framework's robustness and broad applicability.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal health monitoring through one-dimensional Doppler ultrasound (DUS) signals offers a cost-effective and accessible approach that is increasingly gaining interest. Despite its potential, the development of machine learning based techniques to assess the health condition of mothers and fetuses using DUS signals remains limited. This scarcity is primarily due to the lack of extensive DUS datasets with a reliable reference for interpretation and data imbalance across different gestational ages. In response, we introduce a novel autoregressive generative model designed to map fetal electrocardiogram (FECG) signals to corresponding DUS waveforms (Auto-FEDUS). By leveraging a neural temporal network based on dilated causal convolutions that operate directly on the waveform level, the model effectively captures both short and long-range dependencies within the signals, preserving the integrity of generated data. Cross-subject experiments demonstrate that Auto-FEDUS outperforms conventional generative architectures across both time and frequency domain evaluations, producing DUS signals that closely resemble the morphology of their real counterparts. The realism of these synthesized signals was further gauged using a quality assessment model, which classified all as good quality, and a heart rate estimation model, which produced comparable results for generated and real data, with a Bland-Altman limit of 4.5 beats per minute. This advancement offers a promising solution for mitigating limited data availability and enhancing the training of DUS-based fetal models, making them more effective and generalizable.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel framework, NUCS, for coreset selection in transfer learning. NUCS addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating both class-level and instance-level criteria to create a balanced and representative subset for training. Through adaptive budget allocation and sample selection based on category difficulty, NUCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and computational efficiency across various datasets and architectures. Notably, NUCS achieves comparable accuracy to full-data training with 30% of samples and a 60% reduction in computation time on CIFAR100 and Food101. By emphasizing the importance of category difficulty in coreset selection, NUCS offers a robust and data-efficient solution for transfer learning. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As transfer learning models and datasets grow larger, efficient adaptation and storage optimization have become critical needs. Coreset selection addresses these challenges by identifying and retaining the most informative samples, constructing a compact subset for target domain training. However, current methods primarily rely on instance-level difficulty assessments, overlooking crucial category-level characteristics and consequently under-representing minority classes. To overcome this limitation, we propose Non-Uniform Class-Wise Coreset Selection (NUCS), a novel framework that integrates both class-level and instance-level criteria. NUCS automatically allocates data selection budgets for each class based on intrinsic category difficulty and adaptively selects samples within optimal difficulty ranges. By explicitly incorporating category-specific insights, our approach achieves a more balanced and representative coreset, addressing key shortcomings of prior methods. Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates the rationale behind adaptive budget allocation and sample selection, while extensive experiments across 14 diverse datasets and model architectures demonstrate NUCS's consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, on CIFAR100 and Food101, NUCS matches full-data training accuracy while retaining just 30% of samples and reducing computation time by 60%. Our work highlights the importance of characterizing category difficulty in coreset selection, offering a robust and data-efficient solution for transfer learning.

Abstract: This study presents an NNTile framework for training large deep neural networks in heterogeneous clusters. The NNTile is based on a StarPU library, which implements task-based parallelism and schedules all provided tasks onto all available processing units (CPUs and GPUs). It means that a particular operation, necessary to train a large neural network, can be performed on any of the CPU cores or GPU devices, depending on automatic scheduling decisions. Such an approach shifts the burden of deciding where to compute and when to communicate from a human being to an automatic decision maker, whether a simple greedy heuristic or a complex AI-based software.

The RDIRL method is designed to be online, fast, and efficient, using sequential second-order Newton updates to recover the cost function governing adversary actions and goals. This approach minimizes an upper bound on the Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective and demonstrates superior performance in recovering cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that RDIRL outperforms several leading IRL algorithms, making it a promising candidate for real-time scenarios in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. <div>

Abstract: Inferring an adversary's goals from exhibited behavior is crucial for counterplanning and non-cooperative multi-agent systems in domains like cybersecurity, military, and strategy games. Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods based on maximum entropy principles show promise in recovering adversaries' goals but are typically offline, require large batch sizes with gradient descent, and rely on first-order updates, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. We propose an online Recursive Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RDIRL) approach to recover the cost function governing the adversary actions and goals. Specifically, we minimize an upper bound on the standard Guided Cost Learning (GCL) objective using sequential second-order Newton updates, akin to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), leading to a fast (in terms of convergence) learning algorithm. We demonstrate that RDIRL is able to recover cost and reward functions of expert agents in standard and adversarial benchmark tasks. Experiments on benchmark tasks show that our proposed approach outperforms several leading IRL algorithms.

Summary:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly used for learning node embeddings in graphs, but they face the neighbor explosion problem with increasing layers. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) offer a solution by separating feature propagation from training. This study compares PP-GNNs with graph-sampling methods, finding PP-GNNs achieve similar accuracy but face challenges in data loading efficiency and scalability due to input expansion. To improve training throughput, the researchers propose optimized data loading methods and tailored training techniques, resulting in a 15x increase in training efficiency over baseline PP-GNNs and significantly faster speeds compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph datasets. The implementation is open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cornell-zhang/preprop-gnn.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning node embeddings in graphs, typically adopting a message-passing scheme. This approach, however, leads to the neighbor explosion problem, with exponentially growing computational and memory demands as layers increase. Graph sampling has become the predominant method for scaling GNNs to large graphs, mitigating but not fully solving the issue. Pre-propagation GNNs (PP-GNNs) represent a new class of models that decouple feature propagation from training through pre-processing, addressing neighbor explosion in theory. Yet, their practical advantages and system-level optimizations remain underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of PP-GNNs, comparing them with graph-sampling-based methods in training efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. While PP-GNNs achieve comparable accuracy, we identify data loading as the key bottleneck for training efficiency and input expansion as a major scalability challenge. To address these issues, we propose optimized data loading schemes and tailored training methods that improve PP-GNN training throughput by an average of 15$\times$ over the PP-GNN baselines, with speedup of up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to sampling-based GNNs on large graph benchmarks. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/cornell-zhang/preprop-gnn.

Abstract: ''Grokking'' is a phenomenon where a neural network first memorizes training data and generalizes poorly, but then suddenly transitions to near-perfect generalization after prolonged training. While intriguing, this delayed generalization phenomenon compromises predictability and efficiency. Ideally, models should generalize directly without delay. To this end, this paper proposes GrokTransfer, a simple and principled method for accelerating grokking in training neural networks, based on the key observation that data embedding plays a crucial role in determining whether generalization is delayed. GrokTransfer first trains a smaller, weaker model to reach a nontrivial (but far from optimal) test performance. Then, the learned input embedding from this weaker model is extracted and used to initialize the embedding in the target, stronger model. We rigorously prove that, on a synthetic XOR task where delayed generalization always occurs in normal training, GrokTransfer enables the target model to generalize directly without delay. Moreover, we demonstrate that, across empirical studies of different tasks, GrokTransfer effectively reshapes the training dynamics and eliminates delayed generalization, for both fully-connected neural networks and Transformers.

The paper introduces a component-aware pruning strategy for deep neural networks (DNNs) to address the challenge of reducing model complexity in resource-constrained settings. By extending dependency graphs to isolate individual components and inter-component flows, the strategy creates smaller, targeted pruning groups that preserve network integrity.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver outstanding performance, but their complexity often prohibits deployment in resource-constrained settings. Comprehensive structured pruning frameworks based on parameter dependency analysis reduce model size with specific regard to computational performance. When applying them to Multi-Component Neural Architectures (MCNAs), they risk network integrity by removing large parameter groups. We introduce a component-aware pruning strategy, extending dependency graphs to isolate individual components and inter-component flows. This creates smaller, targeted pruning groups that conserve functional integrity. Demonstrated effectively on a control task, our approach achieves greater sparsity and reduced performance degradation, opening a path for optimizing complex, multi-component DNNs efficiently.

<br />Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach to accelerate the training of deep autoencoders using Hessian-free optimization. By incorporating the LSMR method, known for solving large sparse linear systems efficiently, and an improved preconditioner, the training process is optimized. A new mini-batch selection algorithm is proposed to prevent overfitting by starting with a small subset of training data and gradually increasing the mini-batch size based on variance estimates and objective value decrease for validation data. Experimental results show that this stochastic Hessian-free optimization results in faster training of deep autoencoders with improved generalization error. <div>
arXiv:2504.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hessian-free (HF) optimization has been shown to effectively train deep autoencoders (Martens, 2010). In this paper, we aim to accelerate HF training of autoencoders by reducing the amount of data used in training. HF utilizes the conjugate gradient algorithm to estimate update directions. Instead, we propose using the LSMR method, which is known for effectively solving large sparse linear systems. We also incorporate Chapelle & Erhan (2011)'s improved preconditioner for HF optimization. In addition, we introduce a new mini-batch selection algorithm to mitigate overfitting. Our algorithm starts with a small subset of the training data and gradually increases the mini-batch size based on (i) variance estimates obtained during the computation of a mini-batch gradient (Byrd et al., 2012) and (ii) the relative decrease in objective value for the validation data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our stochastic Hessian-free optimization, using the LSMR method and the new sample selection algorithm, leads to rapid training of deep autoencoders with improved generalization error.

Abstract: Depression is a complex mental disorder characterized by a diverse range of observable and measurable indicators that go beyond traditional subjective assessments. Recent research has increasingly focused on objective, passive, and continuous monitoring using wearable devices to gain more precise insights into the physiological and behavioral aspects of depression. However, most existing studies primarily distinguish between healthy and depressed individuals, adopting a binary classification that fails to capture the heterogeneity of depressive disorders. In this study, we leverage wearable devices to predict depression subtypes-specifically unipolar and bipolar depression-aiming to identify distinctive biomarkers that could enhance diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment strategies. To this end, we introduce the CALYPSO dataset, designed for non-invasive detection of depression subtypes and symptomatology through physiological and behavioral signals, including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Additionally, we establish a benchmark on the dataset using well-known features and standard machine learning methods. Preliminary results indicate that features related to physical activity, extracted from accelerometer data, are the most effective in distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression, achieving an accuracy of $96.77\%$. Temperature-based features also showed high discriminative power, reaching an accuracy of $93.55\%$. These findings highlight the potential of physiological and behavioral monitoring for improving the classification of depressive subtypes, paving the way for more tailored clinical interventions.

Abstract: Measurements acquired from distributed physical systems are often sparse and noisy. Therefore, signal processing and system identification tools are required to mitigate noise effects and reconstruct unobserved dynamics from limited sensor data. However, this process is particularly challenging because the fundamental equations governing the dynamics are largely unavailable in practice. Reservoir Computing (RC) techniques have shown promise in efficiently simulating dynamical systems through an unstructured and efficient computation graph comprising a set of neurons with random connectivity. However, the potential of RC to operate in noisy regimes and distinguish noise from the primary dynamics of the system has not been fully explored. This paper presents a novel RC method for noise filtering and reconstructing nonlinear dynamics, offering a novel learning protocol associated with hyperparameter optimization. The performance of the RC in terms of noise intensity, noise frequency content, and drastic shifts in dynamical parameters are studied in two illustrative examples involving the nonlinear dynamics of the Lorenz attractor and adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire system (AdEx). It is shown that the denoising performance improves via truncating redundant nodes and edges of the computing reservoir, as well as properly optimizing the hyperparameters, e.g., the leakage rate, the spectral radius, the input connectivity, and the ridge regression parameter. Furthermore, the presented framework shows good generalization behavior when tested for reconstructing unseen attractors from the bifurcation diagram. Compared to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), the presented RC framework yields competitive accuracy at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and high-frequency ranges.

<div> Keywords: IDRL, reinforcement learning, discriminator-weighted imitation, Dual-RL, offline datasets

Summary: 
IDRL introduces a new method for reinforcement learning that utilizes an optimal discriminator-weighted imitation approach. By training a discriminator with an offline dataset and additional expert dataset, IDRL achieves strong results across various datasets. The method aims to approach the optimal visitation distribution ratio in the offline dataset iteratively. By removing suboptimal transitions and updating the visitation distribution ratio in each iteration, IDRL improves performance and stability compared to Primal-RL and Dual-RL baselines. The approach demonstrates superior performance on D4RL datasets as well as more realistic corrupted demonstrations. IDRL's iterative approach represents a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios, ultimately leading to better results in reinforcement learning tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Iterative Dual Reinforcement Learning (IDRL), a new method that takes an optimal discriminator-weighted imitation view of solving RL. Our method is motivated by a simple experiment in which we find training a discriminator using the offline dataset plus an additional expert dataset and then performing discriminator-weighted behavior cloning gives strong results on various types of datasets. That optimal discriminator weight is quite similar to the learned visitation distribution ratio in Dual-RL, however, we find that current Dual-RL methods do not correctly estimate that ratio. In IDRL, we propose a correction method to iteratively approach the optimal visitation distribution ratio in the offline dataset given no addtional expert dataset. During each iteration, IDRL removes zero-weight suboptimal transitions using the learned ratio from the previous iteration and runs Dual-RL on the remaining subdataset. This can be seen as replacing the behavior visitation distribution with the optimized visitation distribution from the previous iteration, which theoretically gives a curriculum of improved visitation distribution ratios that are closer to the optimal discriminator weight. We verify the effectiveness of IDRL on various kinds of offline datasets, including D4RL datasets and more realistic corrupted demonstrations. IDRL beats strong Primal-RL and Dual-RL baselines in terms of both performance and stability, on all datasets.

Summary:
The paper explores the mean teacher algorithm for language model unlearning, aiming to reduce memorization of specific text instances while maintaining the model's overall capabilities. By approximating a trajectory of slow natural gradient descent, the mean teacher method helps avoid high-curvature updates that could harm model utility. To address vanishing gradients, a new unlearning loss termed "negative log-unlikelihood" (NLUL) is introduced. The combination of mean teacher and NLUL shows improvements in metrics on the MUSE benchmarks. This research offers a promising approach to reducing dataset memorization in language models without sacrificing general performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the goals of language model unlearning is to reduce memorization of selected text instances while retaining the model's general abilities. Despite various proposed methods, reducing memorization of large datasets without noticeable degradation in model utility remains challenging. In this paper, we investigate the mean teacher algorithm (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017), a simple proximal optimization method from continual learning literature that gradually modifies the teacher model. We show that the mean teacher can approximate a trajectory of a slow natural gradient descent (NGD), which inherently seeks low-curvature updates that are less likely to degrade the model utility. While slow NGD can suffer from vanishing gradients, we introduce a new unlearning loss called "negative log-unlikelihood" (NLUL) that avoids this problem. We show that the combination of mean teacher and NLUL improves some metrics on the MUSE benchmarks (Shi et al., 2024).

Abstract: Imitation learning is a widely used approach for training agents to replicate expert behavior in complex decision-making tasks. However, existing methods often struggle with compounding errors and limited generalization, due to the inherent challenge of error correction and the distribution shift between training and deployment. In this paper, we present a novel model-based imitation learning framework inspired by model predictive control, which addresses these limitations by integrating predictive modeling through multi-step state predictions. Our method outperforms traditional behavior cloning numerical benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness to distribution shift and measurement noise both in available data and during execution. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and error bounds of our method, offering insights into its convergence properties.

Summary:  
The paper introduces STAMP, a framework for detecting dataset membership in large language models. It addresses concerns about proprietary data inclusion in model training without attribution or licensing. STAMP involves embedding watermarks with unique secret keys in rephrased versions of the original content, enabling creators to compare public and private versions using statistical tests to prove dataset membership. The framework successfully detects contamination in benchmarks with minimal presence in training data. STAMP maintains semantic meaning and utility of the original data while comparing models. Application of STAMP to real-world scenarios confirms the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in pretraining corpora. <div>

Abstract: Given how large parts of publicly available text are crawled to pretrain large language models (LLMs), data creators increasingly worry about the inclusion of their proprietary data for model training without attribution or licensing. Their concerns are also shared by benchmark curators whose test-sets might be compromised. In this paper, we present STAMP, a framework for detecting dataset membership-i.e., determining the inclusion of a dataset in the pretraining corpora of LLMs. Given an original piece of content, our proposal involves first generating multiple rephrases, each embedding a watermark with a unique secret key. One version is to be released publicly, while others are to be kept private. Subsequently, creators can compare model likelihoods between public and private versions using paired statistical tests to prove membership. We show that our framework can successfully detect contamination across four benchmarks which appear only once in the training data and constitute less than 0.001% of the total tokens, outperforming several contamination detection and dataset inference baselines. We verify that STAMP preserves both the semantic meaning and the utility of the original data in comparing different models. We apply STAMP to two real-world scenarios to confirm the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in the pretraining corpora.

Summary:
Neural surrogate solvers can efficiently estimate solutions to partial differential equations in physical problems but require extensive high-resolution training data. This paper introduces a super-resolution learning framework in solid mechanics, allowing training of high-resolution neural networks using only low-resolution data. The Equilibrium Conserving Operator (ECO) architecture embeds known physics directly into the network to compensate for missing high-resolution information during training. ECO-based super-resolution framework, which strongly enforces conservation-laws in the predicted solutions, is evaluated on examples like embedded pores in a homogenized matrix and randomly textured polycrystalline materials. ECO eliminates the need for high-fidelity data, reducing the upfront cost of data collection significantly, making it a robust and resource-efficient pathway for surrogate modeling in materials science. The ECO approach is applicable to a wide range of physics-based problems.

Abstract: Neural surrogate solvers can estimate solutions to partial differential equations in physical problems more efficiently than standard numerical methods, but require extensive high-resolution training data. In this paper, we break this limitation; we introduce a framework for super-resolution learning in solid mechanics problems. Our approach allows one to train a high-resolution neural network using only low-resolution data. Our Equilibrium Conserving Operator (ECO) architecture embeds known physics directly into the network to make up for missing high-resolution information during training. We evaluate this ECO-based super-resolution framework that strongly enforces conservation-laws in the predicted solutions on two working examples: embedded pores in a homogenized matrix and randomly textured polycrystalline materials. ECO eliminates the reliance on high-fidelity data and reduces the upfront cost of data collection by two orders of magnitude, offering a robust pathway for resource-efficient surrogate modeling in materials modeling. ECO is readily generalizable to other physics-based problems.

Summary: 
- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained popularity for processing graph-structured data, but their shallow model architecture leads to over-smoothing.
- Current approaches to addressing over-smoothing involve adding components like residual connections, but deep GCN success remains limited.
- Messages in GCNs traverse through low-order neighbors, leading to over-aggregation and redundant information aggregation.
- Over-aggregation introduces significant redundancy and is the fundamental cause of over-smoothing in GCNs. 
- Analyzing the intrinsic message passing mechanism of GCNs sheds light on the critical issue of over-aggregation, providing insights for optimizing GCN architectures. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained popularity for their exceptional ability to process graph-structured data. Existing GCN-based approaches typically employ a shallow model architecture due to the over-smoothing phenomenon. Current approaches to mitigating over-smoothing primarily involve adding supplementary components to GCN architectures, such as residual connections and random edge-dropping strategies. However, these improvements toward deep GCNs have achieved only limited success. In this work, we analyze the intrinsic message passing mechanism of GCNs and identify a critical issue: messages originating from high-order neighbors must traverse through low-order neighbors to reach the target node. This repeated reliance on low-order neighbors leads to redundant information aggregation, a phenomenon we term over-aggregation. Our analysis demonstrates that over-aggregation not only introduces significant redundancy but also serves as the fundamental cause of over-smoothing in GCNs.

<div> Keywords: Graph neural networks, out-of-distribution detection, negative energy scores, NODESAFE, node-level OOD data detection

Summary:
NODESAFE introduces a novel approach to improve the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data at the node level. Current methods like GNNSAFE have limitations due to extreme score values and logit shifts, reducing accuracy in OOD detection. NODESAFE addresses this issue by incorporating optimization terms to constrain negative energy scores and mitigate logit shifts, effectively reducing the generation of extreme scores. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in OOD detection, with FPR95 metrics showing a substantial reduction compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. For example, in scenarios with and without OOD data exposure induced by Structure Manipulation, the FPR95 metric is decreased by 28.4% and 22.7%, respectively. NODESAFE offers a promising solution to enhance the ability of GNNs to accurately detect node-level OOD data in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the critical role of graphs in real-world applications and their high-security requirements, improving the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs) to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an urgent research problem. The recent work GNNSAFE proposes a framework based on the aggregation of negative energy scores that significantly improves the performance of GNNs to detect node-level OOD data. However, our study finds that score aggregation among nodes is susceptible to extreme values due to the unboundedness of the negative energy scores and logit shifts, which severely limits the accuracy of GNNs in detecting node-level OOD data. In this paper, we propose NODESAFE: reducing the generation of extreme scores of nodes by adding two optimization terms that make the negative energy scores bounded and mitigate the logit shift. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically improves the ability of GNNs to detect OOD data at the node level, e.g., in detecting OOD data induced by Structure Manipulation, the metric of FPR95 (lower is better) in scenarios without (with) OOD data exposure are reduced from the current SOTA by 28.4% (22.7%).

Summary: 
This study evaluates machine learning models and neural networks for predicting chaotic systems, specifically the multi-pendulum. Synthetic data is generated using the Runge Kutta Method, and various models are tested based on RMSE and R^2 values. A sliding window approach and time-step based approach are compared to accurately capture chaotic motion. The stability of the system is evaluated using Lyapunov exponents. For a double pendulum, the LSTM network performs best in both scenarios. For a triple pendulum, the VRNN is best for the sliding window approach, and the GRU is best for the time step approach in frictionless scenarios. However, in the presence of friction, the LSTM outperforms other models. <div>

Abstract: A chaotic system is a highly volatile system characterized by its sensitive dependence on initial conditions and outside factors. Chaotic systems are prevalent throughout the world today: in weather patterns, disease outbreaks, and even financial markets. Chaotic systems are seen in every field of science and humanities, so being able to predict these systems is greatly beneficial to society. In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and neural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for their ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by generating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time using the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations (ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach, predicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However, to more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we transitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network on many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles, or 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also evaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded that for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both friction and frictionless scenarios. For triple pendulum, the Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN)[4] was the best for the sliding window and Gated Recurrent Network (GRU) [5] was the best for the time step approach, but for friction, LSTM was the best.

<div> Stratify, Federated Learning, Non-IID data, Data heterogeneity, Incremental adjustments <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Stratify, a novel Federated Learning framework designed to address challenges posed by non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data. By systematically managing class and feature distributions using a Stratified Label Schedule (SLS), Stratify reduces bias and variance in aggregated gradients. The approach includes a label-aware client selection strategy to ensure participation only from clients with relevant data. A fine-grained update scheme accelerates convergence and mitigates data heterogeneity, while a secure client selection protocol preserves privacy. Evaluations on various datasets show that Stratify achieves performance comparable to IID baselines, accelerates convergence, and reduces client-side computation. The framework demonstrates practical effectiveness in realistic federated learning scenarios. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) on non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data remains a critical challenge, as existing approaches struggle with severe data heterogeneity. Current methods primarily address symptoms of non-IID by applying incremental adjustments to Federated Averaging (FedAvg), rather than directly resolving its inherent design limitations. Consequently, performance significantly deteriorates under highly heterogeneous conditions, as the fundamental issue of imbalanced exposure to diverse class and feature distributions remains unresolved. This paper introduces Stratify, a novel FL framework designed to systematically manage class and feature distributions throughout training, effectively tackling the root cause of non-IID challenges. Inspired by classical stratified sampling, our approach employs a Stratified Label Schedule (SLS) to ensure balanced exposure across labels, significantly reducing bias and variance in aggregated gradients. Complementing SLS, we propose a label-aware client selection strategy, restricting participation exclusively to clients possessing data relevant to scheduled labels. Additionally, Stratify incorporates a fine-grained, high-frequency update scheme, accelerating convergence and further mitigating data heterogeneity. To uphold privacy, we implement a secure client selection protocol leveraging homomorphic encryption, enabling precise global label statistics without disclosing sensitive client information. Extensive evaluations on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, COVTYPE, PACS, and Digits-DG demonstrate that Stratify attains performance comparable to IID baselines, accelerates convergence, and reduces client-side computation compared to state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its practical effectiveness in realistic federated learning scenarios.

The paper introduces SURE, a novel framework for improving pretrained multimodal models by addressing missing modalities and uncertainty estimation. SURE utilizes latent space reconstruction and statistical error propagation to reconstruct missing modalities and provide reliable uncertainty estimates.

SURE achieves state-of-the-art performance by delivering interpretable results and robust predictions even with incomplete data. <div>
arXiv:2504.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning has demonstrated incredible successes by integrating diverse data sources, yet it often relies on the availability of all modalities - an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. Pretrained multimodal models, while effective, struggle when confronted with small-scale and incomplete datasets (i.e., missing modalities), limiting their practical applicability. Previous studies on reconstructing missing modalities have overlooked the reconstruction's potential unreliability, which could compromise the quality of the final outputs. We present SURE (Scalable Uncertainty and Reconstruction Estimation), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of pretrained multimodal models by introducing latent space reconstruction and uncertainty estimation for both reconstructed modalities and downstream tasks. Our method is architecture-agnostic, reconstructs missing modalities, and delivers reliable uncertainty estimates, improving both interpretability and performance. SURE introduces a unique Pearson Correlation-based loss and applies statistical error propagation in deep networks for the first time, allowing precise quantification of uncertainties from missing data and model predictions. Extensive experiments across tasks such as sentiment analysis, genre classification, and action recognition show that SURE consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring robust predictions even in the presence of incomplete data.

The analysis of VAE's advanced model structures highlights its advantages over MDN, particularly on high-dimensional data like PACE. The study demonstrates that integrating AI technologies with current and upcoming hyperspectral data from NASA missions will enhance our understanding of phytoplankton community dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Phytoplankton absorb and scatter light in unique ways, subtly altering the color of water, changes that are often minor for human eyes to detect but can be captured by sensitive ocean color instruments onboard satellites from space. Hyperspectral sensors, paired with advanced algorithms, are expected to significantly enhance the characterization of phytoplankton community composition, especially in coastal waters where ocean color remote sensing applications have historically encountered significant challenges. This study presents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral missions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to varied combinations of inherent optical properties and associated concentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this study to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time tailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral retrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex estuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation demonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low bias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning designs highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over the mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional data, such as PACE. Our study provides strong evidence that current EMIT and PACE hyperspectral data as well as the upcoming Surface Biology Geology mission will open new pathways toward a better understanding of phytoplankton community dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when integrated with AI technologies.

Abstract: The safety of learning-enabled cyber-physical systems is compromised by the well-known vulnerabilities of deep neural networks to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Existing literature has sought to monitor the safety of such systems by detecting OOD data. However, such approaches have limited utility, as the presence of an OOD input does not necessarily imply the violation of a desired safety property. We instead propose to directly monitor safety in a manner that is itself robust to OOD data. To this end, we predict violations of signal temporal logic safety specifications based on predicted future trajectories. Our safety monitor additionally uses a novel combination of adaptive conformal prediction and incremental learning. The former obtains probabilistic prediction guarantees even on OOD data, and the latter prevents overly conservative predictions. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach in two case studies on safety monitoring: 1) predicting collisions of an F1Tenth car with static obstacles, and 2) predicting collisions of a race car with multiple dynamic obstacles. We find that adaptive conformal prediction obtains theoretical guarantees where other uncertainty quantification methods fail to do so. Additionally, combining adaptive conformal prediction and incremental learning for safety monitoring achieves high recall and timeliness while reducing loss in precision. We achieve these results even in OOD settings and outperform alternative methods.

LA2Former incorporates K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and combines global and local attention to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations on six benchmark datasets show that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy by over 50% compared to existing linear attention methods and outperforms full pairwise attention in optimal conditions.

arXiv:2504.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as promising frameworks for learning mappings governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), serving as data-driven alternatives to traditional numerical methods. While methods such as the Fourier neural operator (FNO) have demonstrated notable performance, their reliance on uniform grids restricts their applicability to complex geometries and irregular meshes. Recently, Transformer-based neural operators with linear attention mechanisms have shown potential in overcoming these limitations for large-scale PDE simulations. However, these approaches predominantly emphasize global feature aggregation, often overlooking fine-scale dynamics and localized PDE behaviors essential for accurate solutions. To address these challenges, we propose the Locality-Aware Attention Transformer (LA2Former), which leverages K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and integrates global-local attention for enhanced PDE modeling. By combining linear attention for efficient global context encoding with pairwise attention for capturing intricate local interactions, LA2Former achieves an optimal balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy by over 50% relative to existing linear attention methods, while also outperforming full pairwise attention under optimal conditions. This work underscores the critical importance of localized feature learning in advancing Transformer-based neural operators for solving PDEs on complex and irregular domains.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has emerged as a key smart grid technology, identifying electrical device and providing detailed energy consumption data for precise demand response management. Nevertheless, NILM data suffers from missing values due to inescapable factors like sensor failure, leading to inaccuracies in non-intrusive load monitoring. A stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based latent factorization of tensors model has proven to be effective in estimating missing data, however, it updates a latent factor solely based on the current stochastic gradient, without considering past information, which leads to slow convergence of anLFT model. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Nonlinear Proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-Incorporated Latent factorization of tensors (NPIL) model with two-fold ideas: a) rebuilding the instant learning error according to the principle of a nonlinear PID controller, thus, the past update information is efficiently incorporated into the learning scheme, and b) implementing gain parameter adaptation by utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, hence, the model computational efficiency is effectively improved. Experimental results on real-world NILM datasets demonstrate that the proposed NPIL model surpasses state-of-the-art models in convergence rate and accuracy when predicting the missing NILM data.

Summary: 
The article discusses concerns about the vulnerability of neural networks to distribution shift in learning-enabled cyber-physical systems. Traditional methods focus on detecting distribution shift during inference to enable abstaining from decision-making, but this approach has limitations in practical applications. The proposal suggests a monitor and recover paradigm for future research, emphasizing robust safety monitoring and distribution shift recovery. This paradigm aims to address the challenges posed by distribution shift more effectively. The article highlights two examples from recent work as illustrations of the proposed approach. <div>
arXiv:2504.13484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the known vulnerability of neural networks to distribution shift, maintaining reliability in learning-enabled cyber-physical systems poses a salient challenge. In response, many existing methods adopt a detect and abstain methodology, aiming to detect distribution shift at inference time so that the learning-enabled component can abstain from decision-making. This approach, however, has limited use in real-world applications. We instead propose a monitor and recover paradigm as a promising direction for future research. This philosophy emphasizes 1) robust safety monitoring instead of distribution shift detection and 2) distribution shift recovery instead of abstention. We discuss two examples from our recent work.

Summary: Existing portfolio management models are often black-box and non-transparent, making it challenging to optimize performance while controlling risk. This study introduces a Bayesian optimization framework that considers dual objectives of maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of observations. By incorporating an adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator, the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management models. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimator in improving performance and reducing risk accumulation. Ablation studies further validate the superiority of the proposed approach in optimizing black-box portfolio management models under limited observations. The framework provides a solution to the critical challenge of optimizing performance while controlling risk in financial systems. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing portfolio management approaches are often black-box models due to safety and commercial issues in the industry. However, their performance can vary considerably whenever market conditions or internal trading strategies change. Furthermore, evaluating these non-transparent systems is expensive, where certain budgets limit observations of the systems. Therefore, optimizing performance while controlling the potential risk of these financial systems has become a critical challenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework to optimize black-box portfolio management models under limited observations. In conventional Bayesian optimization settings, the objective function is to maximize the expectation of performance metrics. However, simply maximizing performance expectations leads to erratic optimization trajectories, which exacerbate risk accumulation in portfolio management. Meanwhile, this can lead to misalignment between the target distribution and the actual distribution of the black-box model. To mitigate this problem, we propose an adaptive weight Lagrangian estimator considering dual objective, which incorporates maximizing model performance and minimizing variance of model observations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over five backtest settings with three black-box stock portfolio management models. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimator.

<div> RNNs, BPTT, target propagation, local representation alignment, gradient regularization<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing and cases with limited training data. However, their training algorithm, Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), has drawbacks. This study introduces a target propagation-based method for RNNs, focusing on reducing instability. The proposed approach, using local representation alignment (LRA), aims to enhance RNN practicality in various applications. Analysis reveals that despite network decomposition, vanishing gradients persist. Gradient clipping, a proposed solution, shows limited impact. To address vanishing gradients, gradient regularization in the update direction is introduced, promoting gradient flow and improving convergence. Experimental results on tasks like temporal order demonstrate the superiority of the regularized LRA RNN over the unregularized version. This research contributes valuable insights into enhancing RNN performance and stability in challenging tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used for real-time processing, streaming data, and cases where the amount of training samples is limited. Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) is the predominant algorithm for training RNNs; however, it is frequently criticized for being prone to exploding and vanishing gradients and being biologically implausible. In this paper, we present and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses local updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN models increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control systems, and robotics.
  The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We thoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with normalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain assumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate that despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still suffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as proposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in an LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We address this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the update and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and meaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the algorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms the unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit temporal order, and random permutation.

<div> Transformer, approximation, function class, curse of dimensionality, expressive capability
Summary: 
- This paper explores the use of Transformers to approximate H\"older continuous function classes.
- Transformers with one self-attention layer and specific activation functions can achieve high approximation accuracy with relatively few feedforward layers.
- The construction is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, offering a clear and intuitive proof compared to previous works.
- The results demonstrate the strong expressive capability of Transformers in overcoming the curse of dimensionality.
- The translation technique proposed in the paper facilitates the application of previous approximation results from feedforward neural networks to Transformer research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer model is widely used in various application areas of machine learning, such as natural language processing. This paper investigates the approximation of the H\"older continuous function class $\mathcal{H}_{Q}^{\beta}\left([0,1]^{d\times n},\mathbb{R}^{d\times n}\right)$ by Transformers and constructs several Transformers that can overcome the curse of dimensionality. These Transformers consist of one self-attention layer with one head and the softmax function as the activation function, along with several feedforward layers. For example, to achieve an approximation accuracy of $\epsilon$, if the activation functions of the feedforward layers in the Transformer are ReLU and floor, only $\mathcal{O}\left(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ layers of feedforward layers are needed, with widths of these layers not exceeding $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2/\beta}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$. If other activation functions are allowed in the feedforward layers, the width of the feedforward layers can be further reduced to a constant. These results demonstrate that Transformers have a strong expressive capability. The construction in this paper is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem and does not require the concept of contextual mapping, hence our proof is more intuitively clear compared to previous Transformer approximation works. Additionally, the translation technique proposed in this paper helps to apply the previous approximation results of feedforward neural networks to Transformer research.

arXiv:2504.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological synapses effortlessly balance memory retention and flexibility, yet artificial neural networks still struggle with the extremes of catastrophic forgetting and catastrophic remembering. Here, we introduce Metaplasticity from Synaptic Uncertainty (MESU), a Bayesian framework that updates network parameters according their uncertainty. This approach allows a principled combination of learning and forgetting that ensures that critical knowledge is preserved while unused or outdated information is gradually released. Unlike standard Bayesian approaches -- which risk becoming overly constrained, and popular continual-learning methods that rely on explicit task boundaries, MESU seamlessly adapts to streaming data. It further provides reliable epistemic uncertainty estimates, allowing out-of-distribution detection, the only computational cost being to sample the weights multiple times to provide proper output statistics. Experiments on image-classification benchmarks demonstrate that MESU mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while maintaining plasticity for new tasks. When training 200 sequential permuted MNIST tasks, MESU outperforms established continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy, capability to learn additional tasks, and out-of-distribution data detection. Additionally, due to its non-reliance on task boundaries, MESU outperforms conventional learning techniques on the incremental training of CIFAR-100 tasks consistently in a wide range of scenarios. Our results unify ideas from metaplasticity, Bayesian inference, and Hessian-based regularization, offering a biologically-inspired pathway to robust, perpetual learning.

Abstract: The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under resource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational efficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms, despite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high computational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability in scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or real-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation Module (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the MindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with independently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features, adaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a convolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational graph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%) models, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and compression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for maintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware acceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its practicality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in resource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.

In this study, the authors explore the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze sentiment embedded within non-financial content on cryptocurrency blockchains.

The findings highlight the significance of blockchain sentiment analysis as a valuable tool for enhancing financial predictions in cryptocurrency markets.

arXiv:2504.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchains, beyond their primary role as distributed payment systems, are increasingly used to store and share arbitrary content, such as text messages and files. Although often non-financial, this hidden content can impact price movements by conveying private information, shaping sentiment, and influencing public opinion. However, current analyses of such data are limited in scope and scalability, primarily relying on manual classification or hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, we address these limitations by employing Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze, detect patterns, and extract public sentiment encoded within blockchain transactional data. Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, we showcase for the first time the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting cryptocurrency price movements on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Our findings shed light on a previously underexplored source of freely available, transparent, and immutable data and introduce blockchain sentiment analysis as a novel and robust framework for enhancing financial predictions in cryptocurrency markets. Incidentally, we discover an asymmetry between cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has an informational advantage over Ethereum in that the sentiment embedded into transactional data is sufficient to predict its price movement.

Summary:
The article introduces the concept of machine unlearning, focusing on eliminating specific data from a pretrained model to address privacy concerns. Previous research has shown accuracy and efficiency in approximated unlearning but lacks exact unlearning capabilities. This study proposes fairness Conjectures based on the variance-bias trade-off and highlights the correlation between fairness and robustness in machine unlearning algorithms. Experiments on ResNet and ViT architectures illustrate that models with a higher fairness gap are more sensitive and vulnerable. Current approximated unlearning algorithms are susceptible to adversarial attacks, leading to a significant decrease in accuracy for unlearned models compared to exact-unlearned models. The article suggests using fairness-gap measurement and robustness metric for algorithm evaluation and advocates for unlearning in intermediate and last layers to optimize time and memory complexity.

arXiv:2504.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning poses the challenge of ``how to eliminate the influence of specific data from a pretrained model'' in regard to privacy concerns. While prior research on approximated unlearning has demonstrated accuracy and efficiency in time complexity, we claim that it falls short of achieving exact unlearning, and we are the first to focus on fairness and robustness in machine unlearning algorithms. Our study presents fairness Conjectures for a well-trained model, based on the variance-bias trade-off characteristic, and considers their relevance to robustness. Our Conjectures are supported by experiments conducted on the two most widely used model architectures, ResNet and ViT, demonstrating the correlation between fairness and robustness: \textit{the higher fairness-gap is, the more the model is sensitive and vulnerable}. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of current state-of-the-art approximated unlearning algorithms to adversarial attacks, where their unlearned models suffer a significant drop in accuracy compared to the exact-unlearned models. We claim that our fairness-gap measurement and robustness metric should be used to evaluate the unlearning algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unlearning in the intermediate and last layers is sufficient and cost-effective for time and memory complexity.

This study introduces a time scheduler based on entropy rather than uniform spacing, ensuring each sampling point contributes equally to generation. The entropic time is independent of the initial time choice, with a tractable formula for estimation. Additionally, a rescaled entropic time is introduced based on optimality results. Experimental results with Gaussian mixtures and ImageNet demonstrate improved inference performance using entropic and rescaled entropic times. Notably, pretrained EDM2 models show significantly enhanced image quality, based on FID and FD-DINO scores, without increasing function evaluations, especially in the few NFEs regime. <div>

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

Summary: 
The paper introduces an efficient algorithm for the Hadamard decomposition, a technique used for data analysis and matrix compression. By leveraging alternating optimization, the global non-convex problem is decomposed into convex sub-problems. Advanced initialization strategies, inspired by SVD, and acceleration techniques, such as momentum-based updates, are incorporated to enhance performance. The algorithm supports more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.

<div> Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning, Prototypical Networks, Graph Continual Learning, Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning, catastrophic forgetting<br />
<br />
Summary: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) is a method that allows models to learn from limited samples of new tasks after initial training on a large dataset. The current approach using Prototypical Networks (PNs) oversimplifies learning and does not integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques effectively. To address these challenges, a new method called Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA) is proposed. MEGA focuses on alleviating catastrophic forgetting by incorporating incremental second-order gradients during meta-training. This allows the model to learn high-quality priors that improve incremental learning. Experimental results on several graph datasets show that MEGA outperforms existing methods, making it a model-agnostic paradigm for Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning. The integration of MEGA enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in this context, paving the way for future research. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Graph Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (GFSCIL) enables models to continually learn from limited samples of novel tasks after initial training on a large base dataset. Existing GFSCIL approaches typically utilize Prototypical Networks (PNs) for metric-based class representations and fine-tune the model during the incremental learning stage. However, these PN-based methods oversimplify learning via novel query set fine-tuning and fail to integrate Graph Continual Learning (GCL) techniques due to architectural constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a more rigorous and practical setting for GFSCIL that excludes query sets during the incremental training phase. Building on this foundation, we introduce Model-Agnostic Meta Graph Continual Learning (MEGA), aimed at effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting for GFSCIL. Specifically, by calculating the incremental second-order gradient during the meta-training stage, we endow the model to learn high-quality priors that enhance incremental learning by aligning its behaviors across both the meta-training and incremental learning stages. Extensive experiments on four mainstream graph datasets demonstrate that MEGA achieves state-of-the-art results and enhances the effectiveness of various GCL methods in GFSCIL. We believe that our proposed MEGA serves as a model-agnostic GFSCIL paradigm, paving the way for future research.

Summary:
Dynamic Regularized Causal Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT) is proposed to address the limitations of existing tree-based causal inference techniques in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in high-stakes applications. The framework integrates variance regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function, dynamically updating regularization parameters using gradient statistics to balance bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments show that CBDT improves estimation accuracy and maintains reliable coverage of true treatment effects, with successful identification of clinically actionable rules and high accuracy in treatment effect estimation in an intensive care unit patient triage study. The results validate that dynamic regularization enhances predictive performance and model interpretability, tightening error bounds effectively. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in high-stakes applications demands models that simultaneously optimize precision, interpretability, and calibration. Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however, exhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they struggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static regularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function of gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the regularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true treatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method successfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy in treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic regularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability.

<div> Keywords: token attribution, language model, attention weights, Attribution with Attention, question answering

Summary: 
Attribution with Attention (AT2) is proposed as a method to efficiently attribute the influence of preceding tokens on a language model's generated sequence. Traditional approaches to token attribution involve ablation of tokens, which can be costly. AT2 leverages attention weights as a heuristic for understanding token influence, treating the attention weights of different heads as features to learn effective attribution. This approach outperforms naive methods and performs on par with ablation-based approaches while being more efficient. By using AT2, less important parts of a provided context in a question answering setting can be pruned, leading to improved answer quality. The code for AT2 is available on GitHub for researchers to utilize. The method showcases the utility of attention weights in understanding language model behavior and enhancing model performance.

arXiv:2504.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a sequence of tokens generated by a language model, we may want to identify the preceding tokens that influence the model to generate this sequence. Performing such token attribution is expensive; a common approach is to ablate preceding tokens and directly measure their effects. To reduce the cost of token attribution, we revisit attention weights as a heuristic for how a language model uses previous tokens. Naive approaches to attribute model behavior with attention (e.g., averaging attention weights across attention heads to estimate a token's influence) have been found to be unreliable. To attain faithful attributions, we propose treating the attention weights of different attention heads as features. This way, we can learn how to effectively leverage attention weights for attribution (using signal from ablations). Our resulting method, Attribution with Attention (AT2), reliably performs on par with approaches that involve many ablations, while being significantly more efficient. To showcase the utility of AT2, we use it to prune less important parts of a provided context in a question answering setting, improving answer quality. We provide code for AT2 at https://github.com/MadryLab/AT2 .

Summary: 
- Childhood vaccination coverage disparities in England persist due to complex interactions among geographic, cultural, demographic, socioeconomic factors.
- Longitudinal machine learning analysis from 2021 to 2024 using NHS records classified districts into low- and high-coverage clusters.
- CatBoost classifier accurately predicted districts' vaccination clusters based on geographic, cultural, demographic data.
- SHAP method identified rurality, English proficiency, foreign-born residents, ethnic composition as key predictors of vaccination coverage.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Childhood vaccination is a cornerstone of public health, yet disparities in vaccination coverage persist across England. These disparities are shaped by complex interactions among various factors, including geographic, demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural (GDSC) factors. Previous studies mostly rely on cross-sectional data and traditional statistical approaches that assess individual or limited sets of variables in isolation. Such methods may fall short in capturing the dynamic and multivariate nature of vaccine uptake. In this paper, we conducted a longitudinal machine learning analysis of childhood vaccination coverage across 150 districts in England from 2021 to 2024. Using vaccination data from NHS records, we applied hierarchical clustering to group districts by vaccination coverage into low- and high-coverage clusters. A CatBoost classifier was then trained to predict districts' vaccination clusters using their GDSC data. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the predictors' importance. The classifier achieved high accuracies of 92.1, 90.6, and 86.3 in predicting districts' vaccination clusters for the years 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024, respectively. SHAP revealed that geographic, cultural, and demographic variables, particularly rurality, English language proficiency, the percentage of foreign-born residents, and ethnic composition, were the most influential predictors of vaccination coverage, whereas socioeconomic variables, such as deprivation and employment, consistently showed lower importance, especially in 2023-2024. Surprisingly, rural districts were significantly more likely to have higher vaccination rates. Additionally, districts with lower vaccination coverage had higher populations whose first language was not English, who were born outside the UK, or who were from ethnic minority groups.

<div> Sparse autoencoders, in-context learning (ICL), mechanism, latent vectors, task vectors <br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the effectiveness of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in interpreting language model activations to deepen understanding of in-context learning (ICL). It identifies abstract SAE features that encode the model's knowledge of task execution and shows that these features causally induce zero-shot tasks, aligning with prior findings on task vectors. The study demonstrates that task vectors can be approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including task-execution features. By adapting sparse feature circuits to the Gemma-1 2B model for ICL, task-detecting features with corresponding SAE latents are discovered, activating earlier in the prompt to detect task completion. These features are linked with task-execution features through attention and MLP sublayers, providing insights into the ICL mechanism. <div>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular tool for interpreting large language model activations, but their utility in addressing open questions in interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate their effectiveness by using SAEs to deepen our understanding of the mechanism behind in-context learning (ICL). We identify abstract SAE features that (i) encode the model's knowledge of which task to execute and (ii) whose latent vectors causally induce the task zero-shot. This aligns with prior work showing that ICL is mediated by task vectors. We further demonstrate that these task vectors are well approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including these task-execution features. To explore the ICL mechanism, we adapt the sparse feature circuits methodology of Marks et al. (2024) to work for the much larger Gemma-1 2B model, with 30 times as many parameters, and to the more complex task of ICL. Through circuit finding, we discover task-detecting features with corresponding SAE latents that activate earlier in the prompt, that detect when tasks have been performed. They are causally linked with task-execution features through the attention and MLP sublayers.

Specifically designed for cylindrical roller bearings, it accurately predicts loads and trajectories under various conditions.

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.

Summary: 
DP2Unlearning is a novel framework for efficiently unlearning sensitive or undesired information from Large Language Models (LLMs) while providing formal forgetting guarantees. It utilizes differential privacy to protect textual data during training, enabling cost-effective unlearning with privacy guarantees. Compared to retraining LLMs from scratch on retained data, DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning at half the cost. It outperforms approximate unlearning methods in preserving model utility and effectively forgetting targeted information. The framework offers a balance between privacy protection and model performance, making it a promising solution for addressing ethical and legal concerns associated with LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

Abstract: We investigate the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to bit-flip attacks (BFAs) by introducing an analytical framework to study the influence of architectural features, graph properties, and their interaction.
  The expressivity of GNNs refers to their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs and depends on the encoding of node neighborhoods. We examine the vulnerability of neural multiset functions commonly used for this purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize a GNN's susceptibility to losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis of the impact of homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation functions on GNN robustness. We derive theoretical bounds for the number of bit flips required to degrade GNN expressivity on a dataset, identifying ReLU-activated GNNs operating on highly homophilous graphs with low-dimensional or one-hot encoded features as particularly susceptible. Empirical results using ten real-world datasets confirm the statistical significance of our key theoretical insights and offer actionable results to mitigate BFA risks in expressivity-critical applications.

Abstract: Stability guarantees are an emerging tool for evaluating feature attributions, but existing certification methods rely on smoothed classifiers and often yield conservative guarantees. To address these limitations, we introduce soft stability and propose a simple, model-agnostic, and sample-efficient stability certification algorithm (SCA) that provides non-trivial and interpretable guarantees for any attribution. Moreover, we show that mild smoothing enables a graceful tradeoff between accuracy and stability, in contrast to prior certification methods that require a more aggressive compromise. Using Boolean function analysis, we give a novel characterization of stability under smoothing. We evaluate SCA on vision and language tasks, and demonstrate the effectiveness of soft stability in measuring the robustness of explanation methods.

Abstract: In machine learning, quantization is widely used to simplify data representation and facilitate algorithm deployment on hardware. Given the fundamental role of classification in machine learning, it is crucial to investigate the impact of quantization on classification. Current research primarily focuses on quantization errors, operating under the premise that higher quantization errors generally result in lower classification performance. However, this premise lacks a solid theoretical foundation and often contradicts empirical findings. For instance, certain extremely low bit-width quantization methods, such as $\{0,1\}$-binary quantization and $\{0, \pm1\}$-ternary quantization, can achieve comparable or even superior classification accuracy compared to the original non-quantized data, despite exhibiting high quantization errors. To more accurately evaluate classification performance, we propose to directly investigate the feature discrimination of quantized data, instead of analyzing its quantization error. Interestingly, it is found that both binary and ternary quantization methods can improve, rather than degrade, the feature discrimination of the original data. This remarkable performance is validated through classification experiments across various data types, including images, speech, and texts.

Abstract: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rotating machinery is critical for industrial safety and maintenance, but existing methods struggle with scarce target-domain data and unclear degradation dynamics. We propose a Meta-Learning and Knowledge Discovery-based Physics-Informed Neural Network (MKDPINN) to address these challenges. The method first maps noisy sensor data to a low-dimensional hidden state space via a Hidden State Mapper (HSM). A Physics-Guided Regulator (PGR) then learns unknown nonlinear PDEs governing degradation evolution, embedding these physical constraints into the PINN framework. This integrates data-driven and physics-based approaches. The framework uses meta-learning, optimizing across source-domain meta-tasks to enable few-shot adaptation to new target tasks. Experiments on industrial data and the C-MAPSS benchmark show MKDPINN outperforms baselines in generalization and accuracy, proving its effectiveness for RUL prediction under data scarcity

Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field, unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However, these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning. However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) has transformed healthcare, particularly in cancer detection and diagnosis. DL surpasses traditional machine learning and human accuracy, making it a critical tool for identifying diseases. Despite numerous reviews on DL in healthcare, a comprehensive analysis of its role in cancer detection remains limited. Existing studies focus on specific aspects, leaving gaps in understanding its broader impact. This paper addresses these gaps by reviewing advanced DL techniques, including transfer learning (TL), reinforcement learning (RL), federated learning (FL), Transformers, and large language models (LLMs). These approaches enhance accuracy, tackle data scarcity, and enable decentralized learning while maintaining data privacy. TL adapts pre-trained models to new datasets, improving performance with limited labeled data. RL optimizes diagnostic pathways and treatment strategies, while FL fosters collaborative model development without sharing sensitive data. Transformers and LLMs, traditionally used in natural language processing, are now applied to medical data for improved interpretability. Additionally, this review examines these techniques' efficiency in cancer diagnosis, addresses challenges like data imbalance, and proposes solutions. It serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners, providing insights into current trends and guiding future research in advanced DL for cancer detection.

Abstract: For a single-gateway LoRaWAN network, this study proposed a history-enhanced two-phase actor-critic algorithm with a shared transformer algorithm (HEAT) to improve network performance. HEAT considers uplink parameters and often neglected downlink parameters, and effectively integrates offline and online reinforcement learning, using historical data and real-time interaction to improve model performance. In addition, this study developed an open source LoRaWAN network simulator LoRaWANSim. The simulator considers the demodulator lock effect and supports multi-channel, multi-demodulator and bidirectional communication. Simulation experiments show that compared with the best results of all compared algorithms, HEAT improves the packet success rate and energy efficiency by 15% and 95%, respectively.

<title>Concept Enhancement Engineering: A Lightweight and Efficient Robust Defense Against Jailbreak Attacks in Embodied AI</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13201</link>

Abstract: Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems integrated with large language models (LLMs) face significant security risks, particularly from jailbreak attacks that manipulate models into generating harmful outputs or executing unsafe physical actions. Traditional defense strategies, such as input filtering and output monitoring, often introduce high computational overhead or interfere with task performance in real-time embodied scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE), a novel defense framework that leverages representation engineering to enhance the safety of embodied LLMs by dynamically steering their internal activations. CEE operates by (1) extracting multilingual safety patterns from model activations, (2) constructing control directions based on safety-aligned concept subspaces, and (3) applying subspace concept rotation to reinforce safe behavior during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that CEE effectively mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance, outperforming existing defense methods in both robustness and efficiency. This work contributes a scalable and interpretable safety mechanism for embodied AI, bridging the gap between theoretical representation engineering and practical security applications. Our findings highlight the potential of latent-space interventions as a viable defense paradigm against emerging adversarial threats in physically grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Multi-turn interactions with language models (LMs) pose critical safety risks, as harmful intent can be strategically spread across exchanges. Yet, the vast majority of prior work has focused on single-turn safety, while adaptability and diversity remain among the key challenges of multi-turn red-teaming. To address these challenges, we present X-Teaming, a scalable framework that systematically explores how seemingly harmless interactions escalate into harmful outcomes and generates corresponding attack scenarios. X-Teaming employs collaborative agents for planning, attack optimization, and verification, achieving state-of-the-art multi-turn jailbreak effectiveness and diversity with success rates up to 98.1% across representative leading open-weight and closed-source models. In particular, X-Teaming achieves a 96.2% attack success rate against the latest Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which has been considered nearly immune to single-turn attacks. Building on X-Teaming, we introduce XGuard-Train, an open-source multi-turn safety training dataset that is 20x larger than the previous best resource, comprising 30K interactive jailbreaks, designed to enable robust multi-turn safety alignment for LMs. Our work offers essential tools and insights for mitigating sophisticated conversational attacks, advancing the multi-turn safety of LMs.

Abstract: As urbanization speeds up and traffic flow increases, the issue of pavement distress is becoming increasingly pronounced, posing a severe threat to road safety and service life. Traditional methods of pothole detection rely on manual inspection, which is not only inefficient but also costly. This paper proposes an intelligent road crack detection and analysis system, based on the enhanced YOLOv8 deep learning framework. A target segmentation model has been developed through the training of 4029 images, capable of efficiently and accurately recognizing and segmenting crack regions in roads. The model also analyzes the segmented regions to precisely calculate the maximum and minimum widths of cracks and their exact locations. Experimental results indicate that the incorporation of ECA and CBAM attention mechanisms substantially enhances the model's detection accuracy and efficiency, offering a novel solution for road maintenance and safety monitoring.

Abstract: Causality and game theory are two influential fields that contribute significantly to decision-making in various domains. Causality defines and models causal relationships in complex policy problems, while game theory provides insights into strategic interactions among stakeholders with competing interests. Integrating these frameworks has led to significant theoretical advancements with the potential to improve decision-making processes. However, practical applications of these developments remain underexplored. To support efforts toward implementation, this paper clarifies key concepts in game theory and causality that are essential to their intersection, particularly within the context of probabilistic graphical models. By rigorously examining these concepts and illustrating them with intuitive, consistent examples, we clarify the required inputs for implementing these models, provide practitioners with insights into their application and selection across different scenarios, and reference existing research that supports their implementation. We hope this work encourages broader adoption of these models in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce KFinEval-Pilot, a benchmark suite specifically designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) in the Korean financial domain. Addressing the limitations of existing English-centric benchmarks, KFinEval-Pilot comprises over 1,000 curated questions across three critical areas: financial knowledge, legal reasoning, and financial toxicity. The benchmark is constructed through a semi-automated pipeline that combines GPT-4-generated prompts with expert validation to ensure domain relevance and factual accuracy. We evaluate a range of representative LLMs and observe notable performance differences across models, with trade-offs between task accuracy and output safety across different model families. These results highlight persistent challenges in applying LLMs to high-stakes financial applications, particularly in reasoning and safety. Grounded in real-world financial use cases and aligned with the Korean regulatory and linguistic context, KFinEval-Pilot serves as an early diagnostic tool for developing safer and more reliable financial AI systems.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery classification offer promising solutions in neurorehabilitation and assistive technologies by enabling communication between the brain and external devices. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on multi-domain datasets, where domain sampling strategies significantly impact model performance due to varying domain importance across downstream tasks. Existing approaches for optimizing domain-level sampling strategies struggle with maintaining intra-domain consistency and accurately measuring domain impact. In this paper, we present Domain Impact-aware Data Sampling (DIDS). To ensure intra-domain consistency, a gradient clustering algorithm is proposed to group training data based on their learning effects, where a proxy language model and dimensionality reduction are employed to reduce computational overhead. To accurately measure domain impact, we develop a Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) guided metric that quantifies how domain-specific parameter updates affect the model's output distributions on downstream tasks, with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, to determine optimal sampling ratios, DIDS combines both the FIM-guided domain impact assessment and loss learning trajectories that indicate domain-specific potential, while accounting for diminishing marginal returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DIDS achieves 3.4% higher average performance while maintaining comparable training efficiency.

Abstract: This article considers the problem of designing adaption and optimisation techniques for training quantum learning machines. To this end, the division algebra of quaternions is used to derive an effective model for representing computation and measurement operations on qubits. In turn, the derived model, serves as the foundation for formulating an adaptive learning problem on principal quantum learning units, thereby establishing quantum information processing units akin to that of neurons in classical approaches. Then, leveraging the modern HR-calculus, a comprehensive training framework for learning on quantum machines is developed. The quaternion-valued model accommodates mathematical tractability and establishment of performance criteria, such as convergence conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fine-tuning paradigm has emerged as a prominent approach for addressing long-tail learning tasks in the era of foundation models. However, the impact of fine-tuning strategies on long-tail learning performance remains unexplored. In this work, we disclose that existing paradigms exhibit a profound misuse of fine-tuning methods, leaving significant room for improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we reveal that heavy fine-tuning (fine-tuning a large proportion of model parameters) can lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, whereas lightweight fine-tuning demonstrates superior effectiveness. Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical validation, we identify this phenomenon as stemming from inconsistent class conditional distributions induced by heavy fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose LIFT+, an innovative lightweight fine-tuning framework to optimize consistent class conditions. Furthermore, LIFT+ incorporates semantic-aware initialization, minimalist data augmentation, and test-time ensembling to enhance adaptation and generalization of foundation models. Our framework provides an efficient and accurate pipeline that facilitates fast convergence and model compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIFT+ significantly reduces both training epochs (from $\sim$100 to $\leq$15) and learned parameters (less than 1%), while surpassing state-of-the-art approaches by a considerable margin.

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) in sequential settings, aimed at complex systems where gradient information is unavailable. Our method combines Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) for design optimization with the Affine-Invariant Langevin Dynamics (ALDI) sampler for efficient posterior sampling-both of which are derivative-free and ensemble-based. To address the computational challenges posed by nested expectations in BOED, we propose variational Gaussian and parametrized Laplace approximations that provide tractable upper and lower bounds on the Expected Information Gain (EIG). These approximations enable scalable utility estimation in high-dimensional spaces and PDE-constrained inverse problems. We demonstrate the performance of our framework through numerical experiments ranging from linear Gaussian models to PDE-based inference tasks, highlighting the method's robustness, accuracy, and efficiency in information-driven experimental design.

<title>Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. Standard implementations rely on Gaussian approximations, which can often accurately predict the mean response but usually introduce significant biases in higher-order moments, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis. To address this limitation, we combine GFDT with recent advances in score-based generative modeling, which enable direct estimation of the score function from data without requiring full density reconstruction. Our method is validated on three reduced-order stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: a scalar stochastic model for low-frequency climate variability, a slow-fast triad model mimicking key features of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and a six-dimensional stochastic barotropic model capturing atmospheric regime transitions. In all cases, the approach captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.

<title>On the minimax optimality of Flow Matching through the connection to kernel density estimation</title>

Abstract: Flow Matching has recently gained attention in generative modeling as a simple and flexible alternative to diffusion models, the current state of the art. While existing statistical guarantees adapt tools from the analysis of diffusion models, we take a different perspective by connecting Flow Matching to kernel density estimation. We first verify that the kernel density estimator matches the optimal rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance up to logarithmic factors, improving existing bounds for the Gaussian kernel. Based on this result, we prove that for sufficiently large networks, Flow Matching also achieves the optimal rate up to logarithmic factors, providing a theoretical foundation for the empirical success of this method. Finally, we provide a first justification of Flow Matching's effectiveness in high-dimensional settings by showing that rates improve when the target distribution lies on a lower-dimensional linear subspace.

Abstract: Learning to perform manipulation tasks from human videos is a promising approach for teaching robots. However, many manipulation tasks require changing control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task. To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human demonstration data -- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

Abstract: In modern smart agriculture, object detection plays a crucial role by enabling automation, precision farming, and monitoring of resources. From identifying crop health and pest infestations to optimizing harvesting processes, accurate object detection enhances both productivity and sustainability. However, training object detection models often requires large-scale data collection and raises privacy concerns, particularly when sensitive agricultural data is distributed across farms. To address these challenges, we propose VLLFL, a vision-language model-based lightweight federated learning framework (VLLFL). It harnesses the generalization and context-aware detection capabilities of the vision-language model (VLM) and leverages the privacy-preserving nature of federated learning. By training a compact prompt generator to boost the performance of the VLM deployed across different farms, VLLFL preserves privacy while reducing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that VLLFL achieves 14.53% improvement in the performance of VLM while reducing 99.3% communication overhead. Spanning tasks from identifying a wide variety of fruits to detecting harmful animals in agriculture, the proposed framework offers an efficient, scalable, and privacy-preserving solution specifically tailored to agricultural applications.

Abstract: Automated noninvasive cardiac diagnosis plays a critical role in the early detection of cardiac disorders and cost-effective clinical management. Automated diagnosis involves the automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac images. Precise delineation of cardiac substructures and extraction of their morphological attributes are essential for evaluating the cardiac function, and diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy, valvular diseases, abnormalities related to septum perforations, and blood-flow rate. Semantic segmentation labels the CMR image at the pixel level, and localizes its subcomponents to facilitate the detection of abnormalities, including abnormalities in cardiac wall motion in an aging heart with muscle abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities. In this paper, we describe a model to improve semantic segmentation of CMR images. The model extracts edge-attributes and context information during down-sampling of the U-Net and infuses this information during up-sampling to localize three major cardiac structures: left ventricle cavity (LV); right ventricle cavity (RV); and LV myocardium (LMyo). We present an algorithm and performance results. A comparison of our model with previous leading models, using similarity metrics between actual image and segmented image, shows that our approach improves Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) by 2%-11% and lowers Hausdorff distance (HD) by 1.6 to 5.7 mm.

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks faces critical challenges due to photon loss and decoherence in optical fiber channels. These fundamentally limit transmission distances and demand dense networks of repeater stations. This work investigates using vacuum beam guides (VBGs)-a promising ultra-low-loss transmission platform-as an alternative to traditional fiber links. By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we demonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended, resulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and operational complexity. We perform a cost-function analysis to quantify performance trade-offs across first, second, and third-generation repeaters. Our results show that first-generation repeaters reduce costs dramatically by eliminating entanglement purification. Third-generation repeaters benefit from improved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error correction. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced response; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains primarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These findings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced photon loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying error mechanisms. Vacuum beam guides thus emerge as a powerful enabler for scalable, high-performance quantum networks, particularly in conjunction with near-term quantum hardware capabilities.

Abstract: This technical report presents a comprehensive analysis of malware classification using OpCode sequences. Two distinct approaches are evaluated: traditional machine learning using n-gram analysis with Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers; and a deep learning approach employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The traditional machine learning approach establishes a baseline using handcrafted 1-gram and 2-gram features from disassembled malware samples. The deep learning methodology builds upon the work proposed in "Deep Android Malware Detection" by McLaughlin et al. and evaluates the performance of a CNN model trained to automatically extract features from raw OpCode data. Empirical results are compared using standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score). While the SVM classifier outperforms other traditional techniques, the CNN model demonstrates competitive performance with the added benefit of automated feature extraction.

<title>How Learnable Grids Recover Fine Detail in Low Dimensions: A Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis of Multigrid Parametric Encodings</title>

Abstract: Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE.

Abstract: Conventional Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for Quantum Machine Learning typically rely on a fixed Hermitian observable, often built from Pauli operators. Inspired by the Heisenberg picture, we propose an adaptive non-local measurement framework that substantially increases the model complexity of the quantum circuits. Our introduction of dynamical Hermitian observables with evolving parameters shows that optimizing VQC rotations corresponds to tracing a trajectory in the observable space. This viewpoint reveals that standard VQCs are merely a special case of the Heisenberg representation.
  Furthermore, we show that properly incorporating variational rotations with non-local observables enhances qubit interaction and information mixture, admitting flexible circuit designs. Two non-local measurement schemes are introduced, and numerical simulations on classification tasks confirm that our approach outperforms conventional VQCs, yielding a more powerful and resource-efficient approach as a Quantum Neural Network.

Abstract: We propose an enhanced deep learning-based model for image segmentation of the left and right ventricles and myocardium scar tissue from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The proposed technique integrates UNet, channel and spatial attention, edge-detection based skip-connection and deep supervised learning to improve the accuracy of the CMR image-segmentation. Images are processed using multiple channels to generate multiple feature-maps. We built a dual attention-based model to integrate channel and spatial attention. The use of extracted edges in skip connection improves the reconstructed images from feature-maps. The use of deep supervision reduces vanishing gradient problems inherent in classification based on deep neural networks. The algorithms for dual attention-based model, corresponding implementation and performance results are described. The performance results show that this approach has attained high accuracy: 98% Dice Similarity Score (DSC) and significantly lower Hausdorff Distance (HD). The performance results outperform other leading techniques both in DSC and HD.

Abstract: Dense ground displacement measurements are crucial for geological studies but are impractical to collect directly. Traditionally, displacement fields are estimated using patch matching on optical satellite images from different acquisition times. While deep learning-based optical flow models are promising, their adoption in ground deformation analysis is hindered by challenges such as the absence of real ground truth, the need for sub-pixel precision, and temporal variations due to geological or anthropogenic changes. In particular, we identify that deep learning models relying on explicit correlation layers struggle at estimating small displacements in real-world conditions. Instead, we propose a model that employs iterative refinements with explicit warping layers and a correlation-independent backbone, enabling sub-pixel precision. Additionally, a non-convex variant of Total Variation regularization preserves fault-line sharpness while maintaining smoothness elsewhere. Our model significantly outperforms widely used geophysics methods on semi-synthetic benchmarks and generalizes well to challenging real-world scenarios captured by both medium- and high-resolution sensors.

<title>CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient comprehension of complex code.
  To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance for evaluating LLMs in code generation, outperforming the best baseline methods with average improvements of 0.202, 0.139, and 0.117 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. Besides, CodeVisionary provides detailed evaluation reports, which assist developers in identifying shortcomings and making improvements. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CodeVisionary.

Abstract: Recently, the rapid development of LEO satellite networks spurs another widespread concern-data processing at satellites. However, achieving efficient computation at LEO satellites in highly dynamic satellite networks is challenging and remains an open problem when considering the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites. For the first time, we propose a novel distributed learning framework named SFL-LEO by combining Federated Learning (FL) with Split Learning (SL) to accommodate the high dynamics of LEO satellite networks and the constrained computation capability of LEO satellites by leveraging the periodical orbit traveling feature. The proposed scheme allows training locally by introducing an asynchronous training strategy, i.e., achieving local update when LEO satellites disconnect with the ground station, to provide much more training space and thus increase the training performance. Meanwhile, it aggregates client-side sub-models at the ground station and then distributes them to LEO satellites by borrowing the idea from the federated learning scheme. Experiment results driven by satellite-ground bandwidth measured in Starlink demonstrate that SFL-LEO provides a similar accuracy performance with the conventional SL scheme because it can perform local training even within the disconnection duration.

Abstract: This systematic review discusses the methodological approaches and statistical confirmations of cross-cultural adaptations of cognitive evaluation tools used with different populations. The review considers six seminal studies on the methodology of cultural adaptation in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. The results indicate that proper adaptations need holistic models with demographic changes, and education explained as much as 26.76% of the variance in MoCA-H scores. Cultural-linguistic factors explained 6.89% of the variance in European adaptations of MoCA-H; however, another study on adapted MMSE and BCSB among Brazilian Indigenous populations reported excellent diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and specificity of 99.2%. There was 78.5% inter-rater agreement on the evaluation of cultural adaptation using the Manchester Translation Evaluation Checklist. A paramount message of the paper is that community feedback is necessary for culturally appropriate preparation, standardized translation protocols also must be included, along with robust statistical validation methodologies for developing cognitive assessment instruments. This review supplies evidence-based frameworks for the further adaptation of cognitive assessments in increasingly diverse global health settings.

<title>Filter2Noise: Interpretable Self-Supervised Single-Image Denoising for Low-Dose CT with Attention-Guided Bilateral Filtering</title>

Abstract: Effective denoising is crucial in low-dose CT to enhance subtle structures and low-contrast lesions while preventing diagnostic errors. Supervised methods struggle with limited paired datasets, and self-supervised approaches often require multiple noisy images and rely on deep networks like U-Net, offering little insight into the denoising mechanism. To address these challenges, we propose an interpretable self-supervised single-image denoising framework -- Filter2Noise (F2N). Our approach introduces an Attention-Guided Bilateral Filter that adapted to each noisy input through a lightweight module that predicts spatially varying filter parameters, which can be visualized and adjusted post-training for user-controlled denoising in specific regions of interest. To enable single-image training, we introduce a novel downsampling shuffle strategy with a new self-supervised loss function that extends the concept of Noise2Noise to a single image and addresses spatially correlated noise. On the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset, F2N outperforms the leading self-supervised single-image method (ZS-N2N) by 4.59 dB PSNR while improving transparency, user control, and parametric efficiency. These features provide key advantages for medical applications that require precise and interpretable noise reduction. Our code is demonstrated at https://github.com/sypsyp97/Filter2Noise.git .

Abstract: Foundation models have recently emerged as a new paradigm in machine learning (ML). These models are pre-trained on large and diverse datasets and can subsequently be applied to various downstream tasks with little or no retraining. This allows people without advanced ML expertise to build ML applications, accelerating innovation across many fields. However, the adoption of foundation models in cybersecurity is hindered by their inability to efficiently process data such as network traffic captures or binary executables. The recent introduction of graph foundation models (GFMs) could make a significant difference, as graphs are well-suited to representing these types of data. We study the usability of GFMs in cybersecurity through the lens of one specific use case, namely lateral movement detection. Using a pre-trained GFM, we build a detector that reaches state-of-the-art performance without requiring any training on domain-specific data. This case study thus provides compelling evidence of the potential of GFMs for cybersecurity.

<title>SwitchMT: An Adaptive Context Switching Methodology for Scalable Multi-Task Learning in Intelligent Autonomous Agents</title>

arXiv:2504.13541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on multiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments. However, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in single-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the agents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a state-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve multi-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while enabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed context/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the scalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these limitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology for RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT employs the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active dendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to create specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that leverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in multi-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves competitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6, and Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better generalized learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of our SwitchMT methodology in addressing task interference while enabling multi-task learning automation through adaptive task switching, thereby paving the way for more efficient generalist agents with scalable multi-task learning capabilities.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is crucial for brand reputation management in the banking sector, where customer feedback spans English, Sinhala, Singlish, and code-mixed text. Existing models struggle with low-resource languages like Sinhala and lack interpretability for practical use. This research develops a hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis framework that enhances multilingual capabilities with explainable outputs. Using cleaned banking customer reviews, we fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa for Sinhala and code-mixed text, integrate domain-specific lexicon correction, and employ BERT-base-uncased for English. The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with confidence scores, while SHAP and LIME improve interpretability by providing real-time sentiment explanations. Experimental results show that our approaches outperform traditional transformer-based classifiers, achieving 92.3 percent accuracy and an F1-score of 0.89 in English and 88.4 percent in Sinhala and code-mixed content. An explainability analysis reveals key sentiment drivers, improving trust and transparency. A user-friendly interface delivers aspect-wise sentiment insights, ensuring accessibility for businesses. This research contributes to robust, transparent sentiment analysis for financial applications by bridging gaps in multilingual, low-resource NLP and explainability.

<title>Task Assignment and Exploration Optimization for Low Altitude UAV Rescue via Generative AI Enhanced Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots (GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system stability compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Soft robots exhibit inherent compliance and safety, which makes them particularly suitable for applications requiring direct physical interaction with humans, such as surgical procedures. However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions. The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including future real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human language as well as code generation, enabling the translation of high-level intents expressed by humans into low-level network configurations. In this paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro, ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks (RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F), explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all users.

To this end, we discuss approximation properties of kernel regression under minimalistic assumptions on both the kernel and the input data. We first prove error estimates in the kernel's RKHS norm. This leads us to new results concerning uniform convergence of kernel regression on compact domains. For Lipschitz continuous and H\"older continuous kernels, we prove convergence rates.

Abstract: Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging, particularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise in tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a critical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for training and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of PET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework that can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted for PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight upgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans such that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become available. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task maintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed approach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR and Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage the inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the attention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by minimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one modality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method achieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the trainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score improvement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in prognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a CT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both PET and EHR data.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is crucial for improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use performance metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). In this paper, we show that commonly used correctness functions bias UQ evaluations by inflating the performance of certain UQ methods. We evaluate 7 correctness functions -- from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LLM-as-a-judge approaches -- across 4 datasets x 4 models x 6 UQ methods. Our analysis reveals that length biases in the errors of these correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LLM-as-a-judge approaches as among the least length-biased choices and hence a potential solution to mitigate these biases.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid framework for literature reviews that augments traditional bibliometric methods with large language models (LLMs). By fine-tuning open-source LLMs, our approach enables scalable extraction of qualitative insights from large volumes of research content, enhancing both the breadth and depth of knowledge synthesis. To improve annotation efficiency and consistency, we introduce an error-focused validation process in which LLMs generate initial labels and human reviewers correct misclassifications. Applying this framework to over 20000 scientific articles about human migration, we demonstrate that a domain-adapted LLM can serve as a "specialist" model - capable of accurately selecting relevant studies, detecting emerging trends, and identifying critical research gaps. Notably, the LLM-assisted review reveals a growing scholarly interest in climate-induced migration. However, existing literature disproportionately centers on a narrow set of environmental hazards (e.g., floods, droughts, sea-level rise, and land degradation), while overlooking others that more directly affect human health and well-being, such as air and water pollution or infectious diseases. This imbalance highlights the need for more comprehensive research that goes beyond physical environmental changes to examine their ecological and societal consequences, particularly in shaping migration as an adaptive response. Overall, our proposed framework demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs to conduct more efficient, consistent, and insightful literature reviews across disciplines, ultimately accelerating knowledge synthesis and scientific discovery.

Abstract: This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and needs to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification. We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.

Abstract: Open-source intelligence provides a stream of unstructured textual data that can inform assessments of territorial control. We present CONTACT, a framework for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that LLMs fine-tuned using few-shot methods can reduce annotation burdens and support structured inference from open-ended OSINT streams. Our code is available at https://github.com/PaulKMandal/CONTACT/.

Abstract: Modern identity verification systems increasingly rely on facial images embedded in biometric documents such as electronic passports. To ensure global interoperability and security, these images must comply with strict standards defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which specify acquisition, quality, and format requirements. However, once issued, these images may undergo unintentional degradations (e.g., compression, resizing) or malicious manipulations (e.g., morphing) and deceive facial recognition systems. In this study, we explore fragile watermarking, based on deep steganographic embedding as a proactive mechanism to certify the authenticity of ICAO-compliant facial images. By embedding a hidden image within the official photo at the time of issuance, we establish an integrity marker that becomes sensitive to any post-issuance modification. We assess how a range of image manipulations affects the recovered hidden image and show that degradation artifacts can serve as robust forensic cues. Furthermore, we propose a classification framework that analyzes the revealed content to detect and categorize the type of manipulation applied. Our experiments demonstrate high detection accuracy, including cross-method scenarios with multiple deep steganography-based models. These findings support the viability of fragile watermarking via steganographic embedding as a valuable tool for biometric document integrity verification.

Abstract: We present new algorithms for estimating and testing \emph{collision probability}, a fundamental measure of the spread of a discrete distribution that is widely used in many scientific fields. We describe an algorithm that satisfies $(\alpha, \beta)$-local differential privacy and estimates collision probability with error at most $\epsilon$ using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{\log(1/\beta)}{\alpha^2 \epsilon^2}\right)$ samples for $\alpha \le 1$, which improves over previous work by a factor of $\frac{1}{\alpha^2}$. We also present a sequential testing algorithm for collision probability, which can distinguish between collision probability values that are separated by $\epsilon$ using $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ samples, even when $\epsilon$ is unknown. Our algorithms have nearly the optimal sample complexity, and in experiments we show that they require significantly fewer samples than previous methods.

<title>Can LLMs handle WebShell detection? Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework</title>

Abstract: WebShell attacks, in which malicious scripts are injected into web servers, are a major cybersecurity threat. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are hampered by issues such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. With BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improved, with an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Larger models such as GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 14B outperform SOTA methods, while smaller models such as Qwen 2.5 3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods. This work is the first to explore the feasibility and limitations of LLMs for WebShell detection, and provides solutions to address the challenges in this task.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique for transferring knowledge from complex teacher models to simpler student models, significantly enhancing model efficiency and accuracy. It has demonstrated substantial advancements in various applications including image classification, object detection, language modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis. Recent innovations in KD methods, such as attention-based approaches, block-wise logit distillation, and decoupling distillation, have notably improved student model performance. These techniques focus on stimulus complexity, attention mechanisms, and global information capture to optimize knowledge transfer. In addition, KD has proven effective in compressing large language models while preserving accuracy, reducing computational overhead, and improving inference speed. This survey synthesizes the latest literature, highlighting key findings, contributions, and future directions in knowledge distillation to provide insights for researchers and practitioners on its evolving role in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing a vector-valued objective function $\boldsymbol{f}$ sampled from a Gaussian Process (GP) whose index set is a well-behaved, compact metric space $({\cal X},d)$ of designs. We assume that $\boldsymbol{f}$ is not known beforehand and that evaluating $\boldsymbol{f}$ at design $x$ results in a noisy observation of $\boldsymbol{f}(x)$. Since identifying the Pareto optimal designs via exhaustive search is infeasible when the cardinality of ${\cal X}$ is large, we propose an algorithm, called Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL, that exploits the smoothness of the GP-sampled function and the structure of $({\cal X},d)$ to learn fast. In essence, Adaptive $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-PAL employs a tree-based adaptive discretization technique to identify an $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set of designs in as few evaluations as possible. We provide both information-type and metric dimension-type bounds on the sample complexity of $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-accurate Pareto set identification. We also experimentally show that our algorithm outperforms other Pareto set identification methods.

Abstract: Off-policy learning ability is an important feature of reinforcement learning (RL) for practical applications. However, even one of the most elementary RL algorithms, temporal-difference (TD) learning, is known to suffer form divergence issue when the off-policy scheme is used together with linear function approximation. To overcome the divergent behavior, several off-policy TD-learning algorithms, including gradient-TD learning (GTD), and TD-learning with correction (TDC), have been developed until now. In this work, we provide a unified view of such algorithms from a purely control-theoretic perspective, and propose a new convergent algorithm. Our method relies on the backstepping technique, which is widely used in nonlinear control theory. Finally, convergence of the proposed algorithm is experimentally verified in environments where the standard TD-learning is known to be unstable.

Abstract: Going beyond 'dendritic democracy', we introduce a 'democracy of local processors', termed Cooperator. Here we compare their capabilities when used in permutation invariant neural networks for reinforcement learning (RL), with machine learning algorithms based on Transformers, such as ChatGPT. Transformers are based on the long standing conception of integrate-and-fire 'point' neurons, whereas Cooperator is inspired by recent neurobiological breakthroughs suggesting that the cellular foundations of mental life depend on context-sensitive pyramidal neurons in the neocortex which have two functionally distinct points. Weshow that when used for RL, an algorithm based on Cooperator learns far quicker than that based on Transformer, even while having the same number of parameters.

Abstract: The explicit incorporation of task-specific inductive biases through symmetry has emerged as a general design precept in the development of high-performance machine learning models. For example, group equivariant neural networks have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains and applications such as protein and drug design. A prevalent intuition about such models is that the integration of relevant symmetry results in enhanced generalization. Moreover, it is posited that when the data and/or the model may only exhibit $\textit{approximate}$ or $\textit{partial}$ symmetry, the optimal or best-performing model is one where the model symmetry aligns with the data symmetry. In this paper, we conduct a formal unified investigation of these intuitions. To begin, we present general quantitative bounds that demonstrate how models capturing task-specific symmetries lead to improved generalization. In fact, our results do not require the transformations to be finite or even form a group and can work with partial or approximate equivariance. Utilizing this quantification, we examine the more general question of model mis-specification i.e. when the model symmetries don't align with the data symmetries. We establish, for a given symmetry group, a quantitative comparison between the approximate/partial equivariance of the model and that of the data distribution, precisely connecting model equivariance error and data equivariance error. Our result delineates conditions under which the model equivariance error is optimal, thereby yielding the best-performing model for the given task and data. Our results are the most general results of their type in the literature.

Abstract: Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art optimizers are adaptive gradient-based optimization methods such as Adam. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in formulating gradient-based optimizers in a probabilistic framework for better modeling the uncertainty of the gradients. Here, we propose to combine both approaches, resulting in the Variational Stochastic Gradient Descent (VSGD) optimizer. We model gradient updates as a probabilistic model and utilize stochastic variational inference (SVI) to derive an efficient and effective update rule. Further, we show how our VSGD method relates to other adaptive gradient-based optimizers like Adam. Lastly, we carry out experiments on two image classification datasets and four deep neural network architectures, where we show that VSGD outperforms Adam and SGD.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a popular approach to improve reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), leading to better techniques to fine-tune large language models (LLM). A weakness of DPO, however, lies in its lack of capability to characterize the diversity of human preferences. Inspired by Mallows' theory of preference ranking, we develop in this paper a new approach, the MallowsPO. A distinct feature of this approach is a dispersion index, which reflects the dispersion of human preference to prompts. We show that existing DPO models can be reduced to special cases of this dispersion index, thus unified with MallowsPO. More importantly, we demonstrate (empirically) how to use this dispersion index to enhance the performance of DPO in a broad array of benchmark tasks, from synthetic bandit selection to controllable generations and dialogues, while maintaining great generalization capabilities. MallowsPO is also compatible with other SOTA offline preference optimization methods, boosting nearly 2\% extra LC win rate when used as a plugin for fine-tuning Llama3-Instruct.

Abstract: Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a surprising capability of large language models (LLMs): given only input feature names and a description of a prediction task, they are capable of selecting the most predictive features, with performance rivaling the standard tools of data science. Remarkably, these models exhibit this capacity across various query mechanisms. For example, we zero-shot prompt an LLM to output a numerical importance score for a feature (e.g., "blood pressure") in predicting an outcome of interest (e.g., "heart failure"), with no additional context. In particular, we find that the latest models, such as GPT-4, can consistently identify the most predictive features regardless of the query mechanism and across various prompting strategies. We illustrate these findings through extensive experiments on real-world data, where we show that LLM-based feature selection consistently achieves strong performance competitive with data-driven methods such as the LASSO, despite never having looked at the downstream training data. Our findings suggest that LLMs may be useful not only for selecting the best features for training but also for deciding which features to collect in the first place. This could benefit practitioners in domains like healthcare and the social sciences, where collecting high-quality data comes at a high cost.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of noise in training datasets for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. We categorize noise into pointwise noise, which includes low-quality data points, and pairwise noise, which encompasses erroneous data pair associations that affect preference rankings. Utilizing Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), we enhance DPO's resilience to these types of noise. Our theoretical insights reveal that DPO inherently embeds DRO principles, conferring robustness to pointwise noise, with the regularization coefficient $\beta$ playing a critical role in its noise resistance. Extending this framework, we introduce Distributionally Robustifying DPO (Dr. DPO), which integrates pairwise robustness by optimizing against worst-case pairwise scenarios. The novel hyperparameter $\beta'$ in Dr. DPO allows for fine-tuned control over data pair reliability, providing a strategic balance between exploration and exploitation in noisy training environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Dr. DPO substantially improves the quality of generated text and response accuracy in preference datasets, showcasing enhanced performance in both noisy and noise-free settings. The code is available at https://github.com/junkangwu/Dr_DPO.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex, nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they face challenges such as high memory requirements and computational costs with limited interpretability. This paper introduces an approach where master equations of physics are converted into multilayered networks that are trained via backpropagation. The resulting general-purpose model effectively encodes data in the properties of the underlying physical system. In contrast to existing methods wherein a trained neural network is used as a computationally efficient alternative for solving physical equations, our approach directly treats physics equations as trainable models. We demonstrate this physical embedding concept with the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE), which acts as trainable architecture for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. The network embeds data representation in orders of magnitude fewer parameters than conventional neural networks when tested on time series data. Notably, the trained "Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network" is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings. This interpretability offers insight into the underlying dynamics of the system that produced the data. The proposed method of replacing traditional DNN feature learning architectures with physical equations is also extended to the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, demonstrating the broad applicability of the framework to other master equations of physics. Among our results, an ablation study quantifies the relative importance of physical terms such as dispersion, nonlinearity, and potential energy for classification accuracy. We also outline the limitations of this approach as it relates to generalizability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Typically, LLMs are first pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during fine-tuning, LLMs may forget some knowledge acquired in the pre-training stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. Existing approaches to mitigate forgetting often rely on access to pre-training data, which may be unavailable in many real-world scenarios--such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). MoFO is an extension of greedy block coordinate descent (BCD) methods: in each iteration, MoFO only updates the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes, while keeping all other parameters fixed. MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance to the default fine-tuning algorithm while effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating forgetting without pre-training data.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates linear programming (LP) within the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed approach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming problem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere to these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not only preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it particularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning scenarios.

Abstract: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.
  To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the rise to dominance of deep learning in unstructured data domains, tree-based methods such as Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) are still the workhorses for handling discriminative tasks on tabular data. We explore generative extensions of these popular algorithms with a focus on explicitly modeling the data density (up to a normalization constant), thus enabling other applications besides sampling. As our main contribution we propose an energy-based generative boosting algorithm that is analogous to the second-order boosting implemented in popular libraries like XGBoost. We show that, despite producing a generative model capable of handling inference tasks over any input variable, our proposed algorithm can achieve similar discriminative performance to GBDT on a number of real world tabular datasets, outperforming alternative generative approaches. At the same time, we show that it is also competitive with neural-network-based models for sampling. Code is available at https://github.com/ajoo/nrgboost.

Abstract: On Efficient and Scalable Computation of the Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimator in Mixture ModelsTwin support vector machine (TSVM) is an emerging machine learning model with versatile applicability in classification and regression endeavors. Nevertheless, TSVM confronts noteworthy challenges: $(i)$ the imperative demand for matrix inversions presents formidable obstacles to its efficiency and applicability on large-scale datasets; $(ii)$ the omission of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle in its primal formulation heightens the vulnerability to overfitting risks; and $(iii)$ the TSVM exhibits a high susceptibility to noise and outliers, and also demonstrates instability when subjected to resampling. In view of the aforementioned challenges, we propose the granular ball twin support vector machine (GBTSVM). GBTSVM takes granular balls, rather than individual data points, as inputs to construct a classifier. These granular balls, characterized by their coarser granularity, exhibit robustness to resampling and reduced susceptibility to the impact of noise and outliers. We further propose a novel large-scale granular ball twin support vector machine (LS-GBTSVM). LS-GBTSVM's optimization formulation ensures two critical facets: $(i)$ it eliminates the need for matrix inversions, streamlining the LS-GBTSVM's computational efficiency, and $(ii)$ it incorporates the SRM principle through the incorporation of regularization terms, effectively addressing the issue of overfitting. The proposed LS-GBTSVM exemplifies efficiency, scalability for large datasets, and robustness against noise and outliers. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the GBTSVM and LS-GBTSVM models on benchmark datasets from UCI, KEEL, and NDC datasets. Our experimental findings and statistical analyses affirm the superior generalization prowess of the proposed GBTSVM and LS-GBTSVM models.

Abstract: The robustness of LLMs to jailbreak attacks, where users design prompts to circumvent safety measures and misuse model capabilities, has been studied primarily for LLMs acting as simple chatbots. Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.

Abstract: Large language models of high parameter counts are computationally expensive, yet can be made much more efficient by compressing their weights to very low numerical precision. This can be achieved either through post-training quantization by minimizing local, layer-wise quantization errors, or through quantization-aware fine-tuning by minimizing the global loss function. In this study, we discovered that, under the same data constraint, the former approach nearly always fared worse than the latter, a phenomenon particularly prominent when the numerical precision is very low. We further showed that this difficulty of post-training quantization arose from stark misalignment between optimization of the local and global objective functions. Our findings explains limited utility in minimization of local quantization error and the importance of direct quantization-aware fine-tuning, in the regime of large models at very low precision.

<title>Robust Universum Twin Support Vector Machine for Imbalanced Data</title>

Abstract: One of the major difficulties in machine learning methods is categorizing datasets that are imbalanced. This problem may lead to biased models, where the training process is dominated by the majority class, resulting in inadequate representation of the minority class. Universum twin support vector machine (UTSVM) produces a biased model towards the majority class, as a result, its performance on the minority class is often poor as it might be mistakenly classified as noise. Moreover, UTSVM is not proficient in handling datasets that contain outliers and noises. Inspired by the concept of incorporating prior information about the data and employing an intuitionistic fuzzy membership scheme, we propose intuitionistic fuzzy UTSVM for imbalanced data (IFUTSVM-ID) by enhancing overall robustness. We use an intuitionistic fuzzy membership scheme to mitigate the impact of noise and outliers. Moreover, to tackle the problem of imbalanced class distribution, data oversampling and undersampling methods are utilized. Prior knowledge about the data is provided by universum data. This leads to better generalization performance. UTSVM is susceptible to overfitting risks due to the omission of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle in their primal formulations. However, the proposed IFUTSVM-ID model incorporates the SRM principle through the incorporation of regularization terms, effectively addressing the issue of overfitting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID model on benchmark datasets from KEEL and compare it with existing baseline models. Furthermore, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID model in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD), we applied them to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed IFUTSVM-ID models compared to the baseline models.

<title>ShadowKV: KV Cache in Shadows for High-Throughput Long-Context LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of long-context large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing demand for efficient support of high-throughput inference. However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence length, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each token generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs. While various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up inference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to sufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding latency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a high-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger batch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV pairs on-the-fly. By evaluating ShadowKV on a broad range of benchmarks, including RULER, LongBench, and Needle In A Haystack, and models like Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3-8B-1M, GLM-4-9B-1M, Yi-9B-200K, Phi-3-Mini-128K, and Qwen2-7B-128K, we demonstrate that it can support up to 6$\times$ larger batch sizes and boost throughput by up to 3.04$\times$ on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance achievable with infinite batch size under the assumption of infinite GPU memory.

<title>Subgraph Aggregation for Out-of-Distribution Generalization on Graphs</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has gained significant attention due to its critical importance in graph-based predictions in real-world scenarios. Existing methods primarily focus on extracting a single causal subgraph from the input graph to achieve generalizable predictions. However, relying on a single subgraph can lead to susceptibility to spurious correlations and is insufficient for learning invariant patterns behind graph data. Moreover, in many real-world applications, such as molecular property prediction, multiple critical subgraphs may influence the target label property. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, SubGraph Aggregation (SuGAr), designed to learn a diverse set of subgraphs that are crucial for OOD generalization on graphs. Specifically, SuGAr employs a tailored subgraph sampler and diversity regularizer to extract a diverse set of invariant subgraphs. These invariant subgraphs are then aggregated by averaging their representations, which enriches the subgraph signals and enhances coverage of the underlying causal structures, thereby improving OOD generalization. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 24% improvement in OOD generalization on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study graph OOD generalization by learning multiple invariant subgraphs. code: https://github.com/Nanolbw/SuGAr

<title>Few-shot Model Extraction Attacks against Sequential Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Among adversarial attacks against sequential recommender systems, model extraction attacks represent a method to attack sequential recommendation models without prior knowledge. Existing research has primarily concentrated on the adversary's execution of black-box attacks through data-free model extraction. However, a significant gap remains in the literature concerning the development of surrogate models by adversaries with access to few-shot raw data (10\% even less). That is, the challenge of how to construct a surrogate model with high functional similarity within the context of few-shot data scenarios remains an issue that requires resolution.This study addresses this gap by introducing a novel few-shot model extraction framework against sequential recommenders, which is designed to construct a superior surrogate model with the utilization of few-shot data. The proposed few-shot model extraction framework is comprised of two components: an autoregressive augmentation generation strategy and a bidirectional repair loss-facilitated model distillation procedure. Specifically, to generate synthetic data that closely approximate the distribution of raw data, autoregressive augmentation generation strategy integrates a probabilistic interaction sampler to extract inherent dependencies and a synthesis determinant signal module to characterize user behavioral patterns. Subsequently, bidirectional repair loss, which target the discrepancies between the recommendation lists, is designed as auxiliary loss to rectify erroneous predictions from surrogate models, transferring knowledge from the victim model to the surrogate model effectively. Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed few-shot model extraction framework yields superior surrogate models.

<title>Order is All You Need for Categorical Data Clustering</title>

Abstract: Categorical data composed of qualitative valued attributes are ubiquitous in machine learning tasks. Due to the lack of well-defined metric space, categorical data distributions are difficult to be intuitively understood. Clustering is a popular data analysis technique suitable for data distribution understanding. However, the success of clustering often relies on reasonable distance metrics, which happens to be what categorical data naturally lack. This paper therefore introduces a new finding that the order relation among attribute values is the decisive factor in clustering accuracy, and is also the key to understanding categorical data clusters, because the essence of clustering is to order the clusters in terms of their admission to samples. To obtain the orders, we propose a new learning paradigm that allows joint learning of clusters and the orders. It alternatively partitions the data into clusters based on the distance metric built upon the orders and estimates the most likely orders according to the clusters. The algorithm achieves superior clustering accuracy with a convergence guarantee, and the learned orders facilitate the understanding of the non-intuitive cluster distribution of categorical data. Extensive experiments with ablation studies, statistical evidence, and case studies have validated the new insight into the importance of value order and the method proposition.

Abstract: This paper introduces an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - enabled content management architecture that is suitable for critical content access in communities of users that are communication-isolated during diverse types of disaster scenarios. The proposed architecture leverages a hybrid network of stationary anchor UAVs and mobile Micro-UAVs for ubiquitous content dissemination. The anchor UAVs are equipped with both vertical and lateral communication links, and they serve local users, while the mobile micro-ferrying UAVs extend coverage across communities with increased mobility. The focus is on developing a content dissemination system that dynamically learns optimal caching policies to maximize content availability. The core innovation is an adaptive content dissemination framework based on distributed Federated Multi-Armed Bandit learning. The goal is to optimize UAV content caching decisions based on geo-temporal content popularity and user demand variations. A Selective Caching Algorithm is also introduced to reduce redundant content replication by incorporating inter-UAV information sharing. This method strategically preserves the uniqueness in user preferences while amalgamating the intelligence across a distributed learning system. This approach improves the learning algorithm's ability to adapt to diverse user preferences. Functional verification and performance evaluation confirm the proposed architecture's utility across different network sizes, UAV swarms, and content popularity patterns.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in vehicle control by guiding agents to learn optimal control strategies through designing or learning appropriate reward signals. However, in vehicle control applications, rewards typically need to be manually designed while considering multiple implicit factors, which easily introduces human biases. Although imitation learning methods does not rely on explicit reward signals, they necessitate high-quality expert actions, which are often challenging to acquire. To address these issues, we propose a reward-free reinforcement learning framework (RFRLF). This framework directly learns the target states to optimize agent behavior through a target state prediction network (TSPN) and a reward-free state-guided policy network (RFSGPN), avoiding the dependence on manually designed reward signals. Specifically, the policy network is learned via minimizing the differences between the predicted state and the expert state. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RFRLF in controlling vehicle driving, showing its advantages in improving learning efficiency and adapting to reward-free environments.

Abstract: Paywalls, licenses and copyright rules often restrict the broad dissemination and reuse of scientific knowledge. We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We propose a new idea for the community to adopt: convert scholarly documents into knowledge preserving, but style agnostic representations we term Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95\%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.

Abstract: We address the problem of active logistic regression in the realizable setting. It is well known that active learning can require exponentially fewer label queries compared to passive learning, in some cases using $\log \frac{1}{\eps}$ rather than $\poly(1/\eps)$ labels to get error $\eps$ larger than the optimum.
  We present the first algorithm that is polynomially competitive with the optimal algorithm on every input instance, up to factors polylogarithmic in the error and domain size. In particular, if any algorithm achieves label complexity polylogarithmic in $\eps$, so does ours. Our algorithm is based on efficient sampling and can be extended to learn more general class of functions. We further support our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating performance gains for logistic regression compared to existing active learning algorithms.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has significantly improved large language model performance, enabling deeper reasoning to solve complex problems. However, this increased reasoning capability also leads to excessive token generation and unnecessary problem-solving attempts. We introduce Don\'t Reason Bench (DNR Bench), a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs ability to robustly understand the tricky reasoning triggers and avoiding unnecessary generation. DNR Bench consists of 150 adversarially designed prompts that are easy for humans to understand and respond to, but surprisingly not for many of the recent prominent LLMs. DNR Bench tests models abilities across different capabilities, such as instruction adherence, hallucination avoidance, redundancy filtering, and unanswerable question recognition. We evaluate reasoning LLMs (RLMs), including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI O3-mini, Claude-3.7-sonnet and compare them against a powerful non-reasoning model, e.g., GPT-4o. Our experiments reveal that RLMs generate up to 70x more tokens than necessary, often failing at tasks that simpler non-reasoning models handle efficiently with higher accuracy. Our findings underscore the need for more effective training and inference strategies in RLMs.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in Lithium ion battery (LIB) health management systems is essential for ensuring operational reliability and safety. However, many existing methods assume that training and testing data follow the same distribution, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen target domains. To address this, we propose a novel RUL prediction framework that incorporates a domain adaptation (DA) technique. Our framework integrates a signal preprocessing pipeline including noise reduction, feature extraction, and normalization with a robust deep learning model called HybridoNet Adapt. The model features a combination of LSTM, Multihead Attention, and Neural ODE layers for feature extraction, followed by two predictor modules with trainable trade-off parameters. To improve generalization, we adopt a DA strategy inspired by Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), replacing adversarial loss with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to learn domain-invariant features. Experimental results show that HybridoNet Adapt significantly outperforms traditional models such as XGBoost and Elastic Net, as well as deep learning baselines like Dual input DNN, demonstrating its potential for scalable and reliable battery health management (BHM).

Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.

Abstract: Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its different application scenarios. However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.

Abstract: At the current stage, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated excellent capabilities in evaluating aerodynamic performance, significantly reducing the time and cost required for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. However, when faced with the task of processing extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) vehicle models, the lack of large-scale datasets and training resources, coupled with the inherent diversity and complexity of the geometry of different vehicle models, means that the prediction accuracy and versatility of these networks are still not up to the level required for current production. In view of the remarkable success of Transformer models in the field of natural language processing and their strong potential in the field of image processing, this study innovatively proposes a point cloud learning framework called DrivAer Transformer (DAT). The DAT structure uses the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which contains high-fidelity CFD data of industrial-standard 3D vehicle shapes. enabling accurate estimation of air drag directly from 3D meshes, thus avoiding the limitations of traditional methods such as 2D image rendering or signed distance fields (SDF). DAT enables fast and accurate drag prediction, driving the evolution of the aerodynamic evaluation process and laying the critical foundation for introducing a data-driven approach to automotive design. The framework is expected to accelerate the vehicle design process and improve development efficiency.

Abstract: Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).

Abstract: Sponge examples are test-time inputs optimized to increase energy consumption and prediction latency of deep networks deployed on hardware accelerators. By increasing the fraction of neurons activated during classification, these attacks reduce sparsity in network activation patterns, worsening the performance of hardware accelerators. In this work, we present a novel training-time attack, named sponge poisoning, which aims to worsen energy consumption and prediction latency of neural networks on any test input without affecting classification accuracy. To stage this attack, we assume that the attacker can control only a few model updates during training -- a likely scenario, e.g., when model training is outsourced to an untrusted third party or distributed via federated learning. Our extensive experiments on image classification tasks show that sponge poisoning is effective, and that fine-tuning poisoned models to repair them poses prohibitive costs for most users, highlighting that tackling sponge poisoning remains an open issue.

Abstract: Saddle points constitute a crucial challenge for first-order gradient descent algorithms. In notions of classical machine learning, they are avoided for example by means of stochastic gradient descent methods. In this work, we provide evidence that the saddle points problem can be naturally avoided in variational quantum algorithms by exploiting the presence of stochasticity. We prove convergence guarantees and present practical examples in numerical simulations and on quantum hardware. We argue that the natural stochasticity of variational algorithms can be beneficial for avoiding strict saddle points, i.e., those saddle points with at least one negative Hessian eigenvalue. This insight that some levels of shot noise could help is expected to add a new perspective to notions of near-term variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Typical machine learning regression applications aim to report the mean or the median of the predictive probability distribution, via training with a squared or an absolute error scoring function. The importance of issuing predictions of more functionals of the predictive probability distribution (quantiles and expectiles) has been recognized as a means to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. In deep learning (DL) applications, that is possible through quantile and expectile regression neural networks (QRNN and ERNN respectively). Here we introduce deep Huber quantile regression networks (DHQRN) that nest QRNN and ERNN as edge cases. DHQRN can predict Huber quantiles, which are more general functionals in the sense that they nest quantiles and expectiles as limiting cases. The main idea is to train a DL algorithm with the Huber quantile scoring function, which is consistent for the Huber quantile functional. As a proof of concept, DHQRN are applied to predict house prices in Melbourne, Australia and Boston, United States (US). In this context, predictive performances of three DL architectures are discussed along with evidential interpretation of results from two economic case studies. Additional simulation experiments and applications to real-world case studies using open datasets demonstrate a satisfactory absolute performance of DHQRN.

Abstract: Hesitant fuzzy sets find extensive application in specific scenarios involving uncertainty and hesitation. In the context of set theory, the concept of inclusion relationship holds significant importance as a fundamental definition. Consequently, as a type of sets, hesitant fuzzy sets necessitate a clear and explicit definition of the inclusion relationship. Based on the discrete form of hesitant fuzzy membership degrees, this study proposes multiple types of inclusion relationships for hesitant fuzzy sets. Subsequently, this paper introduces foundational propositions related to hesitant fuzzy sets, as well as propositions concerning families of hesitant fuzzy sets.

Abstract: We develop a theory of finite-dimensional polyhedral subsets over the Wasserstein space and optimization of functionals over them via first-order methods. Our main application is to the problem of mean-field variational inference, which seeks to approximate a distribution $\pi$ over $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a product measure $\pi^\star$. When $\pi$ is strongly log-concave and log-smooth, we provide (1) approximation rates certifying that $\pi^\star$ is close to the minimizer $\pi^\star_\diamond$ of the KL divergence over a \emph{polyhedral} set $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$, and (2) an algorithm for minimizing $\text{KL}(\cdot\|\pi)$ over $\mathcal{P}_\diamond$ based on accelerated gradient descent over $\R^d$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain the first end-to-end analysis for gradient-based algorithms for MFVI.

<title>Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2404.02151v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a 100% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we provide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.

<title>Is In-Context Learning Sufficient for Instruction Following in LLMs?</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows LLMs to learn from examples without changing their weights: this is a particularly promising capability for long-context LLMs that can potentially learn from many examples. Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance. In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on the established benchmark MT-Bench, especially with more capable base LLMs. We then uncover the most relevant elements for successful in-context alignment, finding the crucial role of the decoding parameters. Based on these insights, we show that the approach of URIAL can indeed be improved by adding high-quality, potentially carefully selected via greedy search, demonstrations in context, getting closer to the performance of instruct models. Finally, we provide the first, to our knowledge, systematic comparison of ICL and instruction fine-tuning (IFT) for instruction following in the low data regime, where ICL can be a viable alternative to IFT. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique and its relationship to IFT. We provide our code at https://github.com/tml-epfl/icl-alignment.

<title>VCR: A Task for Pixel-Level Complex Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Restoring Occluded Text</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2406.06462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.

<title>NeuroNAS: Enhancing Efficiency of Neuromorphic In-Memory Computing for Intelligent Mobile Agents through Hardware-Aware Spiking Neural Architecture Search</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00641</link>

arXiv:2407.00641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent mobile agents (e.g., UGVs and UAVs) typically demand low power/energy consumption when solving their machine learning (ML)-based tasks, since they are usually powered by portable batteries with limited capacity. A potential solution is employing neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which leverages event-based computation to enable ultra-low power/energy ML algorithms. To maximize the performance efficiency of SNN inference, the In-Memory Computing (IMC)-based hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) can be employed. However, SNN models are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying IMC hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energyefficient neuromorphic IMC for intelligent mobile agents using hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Its key steps include: optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, NeuroNAS quickly finds SNN architectures (with 8bit weight precision) that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency improvements, 84% energy savings across different datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200); while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once.

<title>Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11969</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2407.11969v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., "How to make a Molotov cocktail?" to "How did people make a Molotov cocktail?") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended. We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense.

Abstract: Mapping the extent of flood events is a necessary and important aspect of disaster management. In recent years, deep learning methods have evolved as an effective tool to quickly label high resolution imagery and provide necessary flood extent mappings. These methods, though, require large amounts of annotated training data to create models that are accurate and robust to new flooded imagery. In this work, we present FloodTrace, a web-based application that enables effective crowdsourcing of flooded region annotation for machine learning applications. To create this application, we conducted extensive interviews with domain experts to produce a set of formal requirements. Our work brings topological segmentation tools to the web and greatly improves annotation efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art. The user-friendliness of our solution allows researchers to outsource annotations to non-experts and utilize them to produce training data with equal quality to fully expert-labeled data. We conducted a user study to confirm the effectiveness of our application in which 266 graduate students annotated high-resolution aerial imagery from Hurricane Matthew in North Carolina. Experimental results show the efficiency benefits of our application for untrained users, with median annotation time less than half the state-of-the-art annotation method. In addition, using our aggregation and correction framework, flood detection models trained on crowdsourced annotations were able to achieve performance equal to models trained on fully expert-labeled annotations, while requiring a fraction of the time on the part of the expert.

Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires a detailed analysis of protein structures and functions, a task that is inherently complex and time-consuming in traditional protein research. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multimodal large language model for proteins that enables users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers to ensure precise representation adaptation and leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we constructed a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins, each annotated with 20-30 property tags and 5-10 QA pairs per protein, and optimized the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. Experiments demonstrate that ProteinGPT effectively generates informative responses to protein-related questions, achieving high performance on both semantic and lexical metrics and significantly outperforming baseline models and general-purpose LLMs in understanding and responding to protein-related queries. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ProteinGPT/ProteinGPT.

arXiv:2409.11772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in designing neural networks (NNs) with relaxed equivariance, which interpolate between exact equivariance and full flexibility for consistent performance gains. In a separate line of work, structured parameter matrices with low displacement rank (LDR) -- which permit fast function and gradient evaluation -- have been used to create compact NNs, though primarily benefiting classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a framework based on symmetry-based structured matrices to build approximately equivariant NNs with fewer parameters. Our approach unifies the aforementioned areas using Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design of structured matrices similar to LDR matrices, which can generalize all the elementary operations of a CNN from cyclic groups to arbitrary finite groups. We show GMs can also generalize classical LDR theory to general discrete groups, enabling a natural formalism for approximate equivariance. We test GM-based architectures on various tasks with relaxed symmetry and find that our framework performs competitively with approximately equivariant NNs and other structured matrix-based methods, often with one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting recreational angler effort is important for sustainable fisheries management. However, conventional methods of measuring angler effort, such as surveys, can be costly and limited in both time and spatial extent. Models that predict angler effort based on environmental or economic factors typically rely on historical data, which often limits their spatial and temporal generalizability due to data scarcity. In this study, high-resolution data from an online fishing platform and easily accessible auxiliary data were tested to predict daily boat presence and aerial counts of boats at almost 200 lakes over five years in Ontario, Canada. Lake-information website visits alone enabled predicting daily angler boat presence with 78% accuracy. While incorporating additional environmental, socio-ecological, weather and angler-reported features into machine learning models did not remarkably improve prediction performance of boat presence, they were substantial for the prediction of boat counts. Models achieved an R2 of up to 0.77 at known lakes included in the model training, but they performed poorly for unknown lakes (R2 = 0.21). The results demonstrate the value of integrating data from online fishing platforms into predictive models and highlight the potential of machine learning models to enhance fisheries management.

Abstract: We present generalized versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems with the probabilities being transported replaced by lower probabilities. We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated sets, then our version of Monge's, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich's problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich's optimal plan, and for the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations the lower probability versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also discussed.

It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models. Results suggest that contemporary frontier models fall short of the spatial intelligence of animals, performing near chance level on a number of classic tests of animal cognition.

Abstract: We now deploy language models in a wide variety of user-facing applications. Typically, these deployments have some specific purpose, like answering questions about documentation or acting as coding assistants, but they require general language understanding. Under these circumstances these models should not be able to answer irrelevant requests such as, poetry generation or questions about physics, etc. Instead we would like language models to only answer to queries corresponding to desired behavior and refuse all other requests, which we refer to as scoping. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of potential methods from prompting to fine-tuning to preference learning to a recently proposed method for general alignment called Circuit Breakers (CB). Across three families of language models and a broad variety of tasks, we show that it is possible to scope language models. We examine scoping for multiple topics, and fine-grained topics. We ablate diversity of irrelevant queries, layer different techniques, conduct adversarial evaluations and more. Among other results, we find that, when diverse examples of irrelevant queries are available, simple supervised fine-tuning produces the best results, but when such diversity is low, Circuit Breakers perform quite well. One can often get the benefits of both methods by layering them in succession. We intend our study to serve as a practitioner's guide to scoping language models.

Abstract: Topological correctness plays a critical role in many image segmentation tasks, yet most networks are trained using pixel-wise loss functions, such as Dice, neglecting topological accuracy. Existing topology-aware methods often lack robust topological guarantees, are limited to specific use cases, or impose high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel, graph-based framework for topologically accurate image segmentation that is both computationally efficient and generally applicable. Our method constructs a component graph that fully encodes the topological information of both the prediction and ground truth, allowing us to efficiently identify topologically critical regions and aggregate a loss based on local neighborhood information. Furthermore, we introduce a strict topological metric capturing the homotopy equivalence between the union and intersection of prediction-label pairs. We formally prove the topological guarantees of our approach and empirically validate its effectiveness on binary and multi-class datasets. Our loss demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with up to fivefold faster loss computation compared to persistent homology methods.

<title>PriorDiffusion: Leverage Language Prior in Diffusion Models for Monocular Depth Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2411.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent ambiguity and visual nuisance. We argue that language prior can enhance monocular depth estimation by leveraging the inductive bias learned during the text-to-image pre-training of diffusion models. The ability of these models to generate images that align with text indicates that they have learned the spatial relationships, size, and shape of specified objects, which can be applied to improve depth estimation. Thus, we propose PriorDiffusion, using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that takes both images and corresponding text descriptions to infer affine-invariant depth through a denoising process. We also show that language prior enhances the model's perception of specific regions of images that users care about and describe. Simultaneously, language prior acts as a constraint to accelerate the convergence of both training and the inference diffusion trajectory. By training on HyperSim and Virtual KITTI, we achieve faster training convergence, fewer inference diffusion steps, and state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across NYUv2, KITTI, ETH3D, and ScanNet. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Human motion is inherently continuous and dynamic, posing significant challenges for generative models. While discrete generation methods are widely used, they suffer from limited expressiveness and frame-wise noise artifacts. In contrast, continuous approaches produce smoother, more natural motion but often struggle to adhere to conditioning signals due to high-dimensional complexity and limited training data. To resolve this discord between discrete and continuous representations, we introduce DisCoRD: Discrete Tokens to Continuous Motion via Rectified Flow Decoding, a novel method that leverages rectified flow to decode discrete motion tokens in the continuous, raw motion space. Our core idea is to frame token decoding as a conditional generation task, ensuring that DisCoRD captures fine-grained dynamics and achieves smoother, more natural motions. Compatible with any discrete-based framework, our method enhances naturalness without compromising faithfulness to the conditioning signals on diverse settings.

arXiv:2412.00383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling advanced understanding and reasoning capabilities across a variety of tasks. Fine-tuning these models for specific domains, particularly through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies like LoRA, has become a prevalent practice due to its efficiency. However, this raises significant privacy and security concerns, as models may inadvertently retain and disseminate sensitive or undesirable information. To address these issues, we introduce a novel instance-wise unlearning framework, LLMEraser, which systematically categorizes unlearning tasks and applies precise parameter adjustments using influence functions. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that are often limited in scope and require extensive retraining, LLMEraser is designed to handle a broad spectrum of unlearning tasks without compromising model performance.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., carefully crafted input samples that can cause models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, adversarial training and detection-based defenses have been proposed to strengthen models in advance. However, most of these approaches focus on a single data modality, overlooking the relationships between visual patterns and textual descriptions of the input. In this paper, we propose a novel defense, MultiShield, designed to combine and complement these defenses with multi-modal information to further enhance their robustness. MultiShield leverages multi-modal large language models to detect adversarial examples and abstain from uncertain classifications when there is no alignment between textual and visual representations of the input. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, using robust and non-robust image classification models, demonstrate that MultiShield can be easily integrated to detect and reject adversarial examples, outperforming the original defenses.

Abstract: The field of self-supervised learning (SSL) for 3D medical images lacks consistency and standardization. While many methods have been developed, it is impossible to identify the current state-of-the-art, due to i) varying and small pretraining datasets, ii) varying architectures, and iii) being evaluated on differing downstream datasets. In this paper, we bring clarity to this field and lay the foundation for further method advancements through three key contributions: We a) publish the largest publicly available pre-training dataset comprising 114k 3D brain MRI volumes, enabling all practitioners to pre-train on a large-scale dataset. We b) benchmark existing 3D self-supervised learning methods on this dataset for a state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer architecture, clarifying the state of 3D SSL pre-training. Among many findings, we show that pre-trained methods can exceed a strong from-scratch nnU-Net ResEnc-L baseline. Lastly, we c) publish the code of our pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks and provide the pre-trained models created during the benchmarking process to facilitate rapid adoption and reproduction.

Abstract: Recently, Cella and Martin proved how, under an assumption called consonance, a credal set (i.e. a closed and convex set of probabilities) can be derived from the conformal transducer associated with transductive conformal prediction. We show that the Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) associated with such a credal set corresponds to the classical Conformal Prediction Region. In proving this result, we establish a new relationship between Conformal Prediction and Imprecise Probability (IP) theories, via the IP concept of a cloud. A byproduct of our presentation is the discovery that consonant plausibility functions are monoid homomorphisms, a new algebraic property of an IP tool.

Abstract: Many works have investigated reinforcement learning (RL) for routing and spectrum assignment on flex-grid networks but only one work to date has examined RL for fixed-grid with flex-rate transponders, despite production systems using this paradigm. Flex-rate transponders allow existing lightpaths to accommodate new services, a task we term routing and wavelength assignment with lightpath reuse (RWA-LR). We re-examine this problem and present a thorough benchmarking of heuristic algorithms for RWA-LR, which are shown to have 6% increased throughput when candidate paths are ordered by number of hops, rather than total length. We train an RL agent for RWA-LR with graph attention networks for the policy and value functions to exploit the graph-structured data. We provide details of our methodology and open source all of our code for reproduction. We outperform the previous state-of-the-art RL approach by 2.5% (17.4 Tbps mean additional throughput) and the best heuristic by 1.2% (8.5 Tbps mean additional throughput). This marginal gain highlights the difficulty in learning effective RL policies on long horizon resource allocation tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is concerned with how intelligence agents take actions in a given environment to maximize the cumulative reward they receive. In healthcare, applying RL algorithms could assist patients in improving their health status. In ride-sharing platforms, applying RL algorithms could increase drivers' income and customer satisfaction. For large language models, applying RL algorithms could align their outputs with human preferences. Over the past decade, RL has been arguably one of the most vibrant research frontiers in machine learning. Nevertheless, statistics as a field, as opposed to computer science, has only recently begun to engage with RL both in depth and in breadth. This chapter presents a selective review of statistical inferential tools for RL, covering both hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction. Our goal is to highlight the value of statistical inference in RL for both the statistics and machine learning communities, and to promote the broader application of classical statistical inference tools in this vibrant area of research.

arXiv:2502.16542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loss functions constructed by applying transformations to the realization and prediction variables of (strictly) consistent loss functions have been extensively studied empirically, yet their theoretical foundations remain unexplored. To address this gap, we establish formal characterizations of (strict) consistency for such transformed loss functions and their corresponding elicitable functionals. Our analysis focuses on two interrelated cases: (a) transformations applied solely to the realization variable and (b) bijective transformations applied jointly to both the realization and prediction variables. These cases extend the well-established framework of transformations applied exclusively to the prediction variable, as formalized by Osband's revelation principle. We further develop analogous characterizations for (strict) identification functions. The resulting theoretical framework is broadly applicable to statistical and machine learning methodologies. When applied to Bregman and expectile loss functions, our framework enables two key advancements: (a) the interpretation of empirical findings from models trained with transformed loss functions and (b) the systematic construction of novel identifiable and elicitable functionals, including the g-transformed expectation and g-transformed expectile. By unifying theoretical insights with practical applications, this work advances principled methodologies for designing loss functions in complex predictive tasks. Applications of the framework to simulated and real-world data illustrate its practical utility in diverse settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that generates implicit labels by learning underlined patterns and extracting discriminative features from unlabeled data without manual labelling. Contrastive learning introduces the concept of "positive" and "negative" samples, where positive pairs (e.g., variation of the same image/object) are brought together in the embedding space, and negative pairs (e.g., views from different images/objects) are pushed farther away. This methodology has shown significant improvements in image understanding and image text analysis without much reliance on labeled data. In this paper, we comprehensively discuss the terminologies, recent developments and applications of contrastive learning with respect to text-image models. Specifically, we provide an overview of the approaches of contrastive learning in text-image models in recent years. Secondly, we categorize the approaches based on different model structures. Thirdly, we further introduce and discuss the latest advances of the techniques used in the process such as pretext tasks for both images and text, architectural structures, and key trends. Lastly, we discuss the recent state-of-art applications of self-supervised contrastive learning Text-Image based models.

arXiv:2503.17140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful tool for approximating quantum wavefunctions using deep learning. While these models achieve remarkable accuracy, understanding how they encode physical information remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce adiabatic fine-tuning, a scheme that trains NQS across a phase diagram, leading to strongly correlated weight representations across different models. This correlation in weight space enables the detection of phase transitions in quantum systems by analyzing the trained network weights alone. We validate our approach on the transverse field Ising model and the J1-J2 Heisenberg model, demonstrating that phase transitions manifest as distinct structures in weight space. Our results establish a connection between physical phase transitions and the geometry of neural network parameters, opening new directions for the interpretability of machine learning models in physics.

<title>Minimax Optimal Convergence of Gradient Descent in Logistic Regression via Large and Adaptive Stepsizes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04105</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.04105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\textit{gradient descent}$ (GD) for logistic regression on linearly separable data with stepsizes that adapt to the current risk, scaled by a constant hyperparameter $\eta$. We show that after at most $1/\gamma^2$ burn-in steps, GD achieves a risk upper bounded by $\exp(-\Theta(\eta))$, where $\gamma$ is the margin of the dataset. As $\eta$ can be arbitrarily large, GD attains an arbitrarily small risk $\textit{immediately after the burn-in steps}$, though the risk evolution may be $\textit{non-monotonic}$.
  We further construct hard datasets with margin $\gamma$, where any batch (or online) first-order method requires $\Omega(1/\gamma^2)$ steps to find a linear separator. Thus, GD with large, adaptive stepsizes is $\textit{minimax optimal}$ among first-order batch methods. Notably, the classical $\textit{Perceptron}$ (Novikoff, 1962), a first-order online method, also achieves a step complexity of $1/\gamma^2$, matching GD even in constants.
  Finally, our GD analysis extends to a broad class of loss functions and certain two-layer networks.

Abstract: High-quality code documentation is crucial for software development especially in the era of AI. However, generating it automatically using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, as existing approaches often produce incomplete, unhelpful, or factually incorrect outputs. We introduce DocAgent, a novel multi-agent collaborative system using topological code processing for incremental context building. Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently. Our ablation study confirms the vital role of the topological processing order. DocAgent offers a robust approach for reliable code documentation generation in complex and proprietary repositories.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach to understanding the collaboration patterns among experts in Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs). By employing hierarchical sparse dictionary learning (HSDL), the study effectively identifies the specific input types that experts collaborate on and uncovers their semantic significance across various tasks. Additionally, the Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm is proposed to optimize MoE LLMs by removing low-contribution experts. Experimental results demonstrate that expert collaboration patterns are closely tied to input types and pruning low-contribution experts can enhance overall performance by 2.5% on average, surpassing existing methods. These findings shed light on how expert interactions influence model efficiency and interpretability, ultimately improving model optimization. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts based large language models (MoE LLMs) have shown significant promise in multitask adaptability by dynamically routing inputs to specialized experts. Despite their success, the collaborative mechanisms among experts are still not well understood, limiting both the interpretability and optimization of these models. In this paper, we focus on two critical issues: (1) identifying expert collaboration patterns, and (2) optimizing MoE LLMs through expert pruning. To address the first issue, we propose a hierarchical sparse dictionary learning (HSDL) method that uncovers the collaboration patterns among experts. For the second issue, we introduce the Contribution-Aware Expert Pruning (CAEP) algorithm, which effectively prunes low-contribution experts. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that expert collaboration patterns are closely linked to specific input types and exhibit semantic significance across various tasks. Moreover, pruning experiments show that our approach improves overall performance by 2.5\% on average, outperforming existing methods. These findings offer valuable insights into enhancing the efficiency and interpretability of MoE LLMs, offering a clearer understanding of expert interactions and improving model optimization.

<div> Keywords: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), data-driven customization, multiturn setting, Activated LoRA (aLoRA), intrinsics models <br />
Summary: 
Activated LoRA (aLoRA) is introduced as an improved framework for finetuning large foundation models such as LoRA, allowing for efficient adaptation of weights in multiturn settings. Unlike LoRA, aLoRA only adjusts token weights after activation, eliminating the need to recompute key-value caches for each turn. This enables the use of specialized intrinsics models that can be instantly activated for specific operations within a conversation chain. By training a set of intrinsics models using aLoRA, competitive accuracy with standard LoRA is achieved while significantly improving inference efficiency. The innovation of aLoRA lies in its ability to streamline the adaptation process and enable quick customization of model behavior without redundant computations. <div>
arXiv:2504.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is highly inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. highly specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We use aLoRA to train a set of intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits.

In the paper titled "Scaling Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization Objectives for Multi-Objective Optimization," the authors address the challenge of effectively balancing multiple objectives in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. They propose a novel technique that involves scaling QUBO objectives to have unit variance, thereby aligning them onto a common scale. This approach allows for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the objectives with equal weights and can aid in the selection of appropriate weights during scalarization. Through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective optimization problems, the advantages of this technique are demonstrated, highlighting its efficacy in solving multi-objective optimization problems where manually selecting scalarization weights is challenging and efficient solutions are limited.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are scarce.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across industries, driven by advances in deep learning and natural language processing, and fueled by large-scale data and computing resources. Despite its rapid adoption, the opacity of AI systems poses significant challenges to trust and acceptance.
  This work explores the intersection of connectionist and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence, focusing on the derivation of interpretable symbolic models, such as decision trees, from feedforward neural networks (FNNs). Decision trees provide a transparent framework for elucidating the operations of neural networks while preserving their functionality. The derivation is presented in a step-by-step approach and illustrated with several examples. A systematic methodology is proposed to bridge neural and symbolic paradigms by exploiting distributed representations in FNNs to identify symbolic components, including fillers, roles, and their interrelationships. The process traces neuron activation values and input configurations across network layers, mapping activations and their underlying inputs to decision tree edges. The resulting symbolic structures effectively capture FNN decision processes and enable scalability to deeper networks through iterative refinement of subpaths for each hidden layer.
  To validate the theoretical framework, a prototype was developed using Keras .h5-data and emulating TensorFlow within the Java JDK/JavaFX environment. This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of extracting symbolic representations from neural networks, enhancing trust in AI systems, and promoting accountability.

Summary: <br />
The paper explores the use of Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. Synthetic datasets with known spatially varying and nonlinear effects are generated across different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors from various spatial weights matrices are tested with popular machine learning models like Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet. The accuracies of these models, measured in cross-validated R2 values, are compared to models using only location coordinates as features. Results indicate that models relying solely on coordinates outperform eigenvector-based approaches in various experiments and datasets. The study suggests that while eigenvectors may not be as effective for spatial processes with positive autocorrelation, they could still have utility in modeling network autocorrelation and scenarios with negative spatial autocorrelation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Moran Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) approaches have shown promise in accounting for spatial effects in statistical models. Can this extend to machine learning? This paper examines the effectiveness of using Moran Eigenvectors as additional spatial features in machine learning models. We generate synthetic datasets with known processes involving spatially varying and nonlinear effects across two different geometries. Moran Eigenvectors calculated from different spatial weights matrices, with and without a priori eigenvector selection, are tested. We assess the performance of popular machine learning models, including Random Forests, LightGBM, XGBoost, and TabNet, and benchmark their accuracies in terms of cross-validated R2 values against models that use only coordinates as features. We also extract coefficients and functions from the models using GeoShapley and compare them with the true processes. Results show that machine learning models using only location coordinates achieve better accuracies than eigenvector-based approaches across various experiments and datasets. Furthermore, we discuss that while these findings are relevant for spatial processes that exhibit positive spatial autocorrelation, they do not necessarily apply when modeling network autocorrelation and cases with negative spatial autocorrelation, where Moran Eigenvectors would still be useful.

Summary: 
In this paper, the authors address the crucial issue of fairness in machine learning, particularly focusing on mitigating discrimination against marginalized groups. They propose a novel approach that incorporates subgroup justice concepts into gradient-boosting machines for supervised learning tasks. By expanding the traditional gradient-boosting methodologies to include a min-max fairness term in the objective function, the algorithm can now address a wider range of fairness considerations. The authors investigate the theoretical properties of the min-max optimization problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through theoretical proofs and empirical experiments. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting algorithm is shown to converge under mild conditions and offers a flexible solution for achieving both binary and subgroup fairness in predictive models. This work highlights the importance of incorporating fairness considerations into machine learning algorithms to ensure equitable outcomes across different demographic groups. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In recent years, fairness in machine learning has emerged as a critical concern to ensure that developed and deployed predictive models do not have disadvantageous predictions for marginalized groups. It is essential to mitigate discrimination against individuals based on protected attributes such as gender and race. In this work, we consider applying subgroup justice concepts to gradient-boosting machines designed for supervised learning problems. Our approach expanded gradient-boosting methodologies to explore a broader range of objective functions, which combines conventional losses such as the ones from classification and regression and a min-max fairness term. We study relevant theoretical properties of the solution of the min-max optimization problem. The optimization process explored the primal-dual problems at each boosting round. This generic framework can be adapted to diverse fairness concepts. The proposed min-max primal-dual gradient boosting algorithm was theoretically shown to converge under mild conditions and empirically shown to be a powerful and flexible approach to address binary and subgroup fairness.

Summary: 
Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer pretraining due to its sparse routing mechanism. However, sparse backward updates can cause training instability and suboptimal performance. To address this issue, a lightweight approximation method called Default MoE is introduced. This method provides the MoE router with dense gradient updates while maintaining sparse parameter activation. By filling in missing expert activations with default outputs derived from an exponential moving average of past outputs, the router can receive signals from all experts for each input token. Default MoE shows significant improvements over standard TopK routing in various scenarios, without incurring notable computational overhead. This approach enhances training performance by enabling the router to access information from all experts, leading to better overall results. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) pretraining is more scalable than dense Transformer pretraining, because MoEs learn to route inputs to a sparse set of their feedforward parameters. However, this means that MoEs only receive a sparse backward update, leading to training instability and suboptimal performance. We present a lightweight approximation method that gives the MoE router a dense gradient update while continuing to sparsely activate its parameters. Our method, which we refer to as Default MoE, substitutes missing expert activations with default outputs consisting of an exponential moving average of expert outputs previously seen over the course of training. This allows the router to receive signals from every expert for each token, leading to significant improvements in training performance. Our Default MoE outperforms standard TopK routing in a variety of settings without requiring significant computational overhead. Code: https://github.com/vatsal0/default-moe.

Abstract: The intersection of deep learning and symbolic mathematics has seen rapid progress in recent years, exemplified by the work of Lample and Charton. They demonstrated that effective training of machine learning models for solving mathematical problems critically depends on high-quality, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we address the computation of Gr\"obner basis using Transformers. While a dataset generation method tailored to Transformer-based Gr\"obner basis computation has previously been proposed, it lacked theoretical guarantees regarding the generality or quality of the generated datasets. In this work, we prove that datasets generated by the previously proposed algorithm are sufficiently general, enabling one to ensure that Transformers can learn a sufficiently diverse range of Gr\"obner bases. Moreover, we propose an extended and generalized algorithm to systematically construct datasets of ideal generators, further enhancing the training effectiveness of Transformer. Our results provide a rigorous geometric foundation for Transformers to address a mathematical problem, which is an answer to Lample and Charton's idea of training on diverse or representative inputs.

<br />
Summary:
The paper introduces the Distributed Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework to optimize fine-tuning for foundation models in distributed computing environments. D2FT strategically orchestrates operations across attention modules, reducing computational workload by 40% and communication costs by 50% with minimal accuracy drops. Three selection strategies are employed to efficiently distribute computation, addressing workload imbalances. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of D2FT in reducing training costs while maintaining accuracy. The framework is also extended to LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, showing a 4% to 6% accuracy drop on the Stanford Cars dataset with reduced computational and communication costs. D2FT leverages the foundation nature of models to optimize fine-tuning processes and pave the way for efficient adaptation in commercial devices with limited memory bandwidth.

Abstract: Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in adapting models to downstream tasks with minimal training efforts. However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation models poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model fine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory bandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this issue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory requirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their foundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high computational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed Dynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations across attention modules based on our observation that not all attention modules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning foundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT significantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning foundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in distributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via multiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and training communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show that D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique. By reducing 40% computational cost or 50% communication cost, D2FT LoRA top-1 accuracy only drops 4% to 6% on Stanford Cars dataset.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become an important technical and storytelling tool to deploy the latest machine learning systems. In this book, we hope to give a gentle introduction to the core methods for people with some level of quantitative background. The book starts with the origins of RLHF -- both in recent literature and in a convergence of disparate fields of science in economics, philosophy, and optimal control. We then set the stage with definitions, problem formulation, data collection, and other common math used in the literature. The core of the book details every optimization stage in using RLHF, from starting with instruction tuning to training a reward model and finally all of rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. The book concludes with advanced topics -- understudied research questions in synthetic data and evaluation -- and open questions for the field.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, engineering design, continual learning, regression tasks, catastrophic forgetting 

Summary: 
This paper introduces the concept of continual learning (CL) to engineering design, addressing the challenge of models forgetting previously learned information when new data is introduced. By benchmarking various CL methods on regression tasks using engineering datasets, the study evaluates their ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting and improve generalization. Results indicate that applying CL methods, particularly the Replay strategy, can significantly enhance performance compared to naive baselines. The Replay strategy, in particular, achieved comparable results to retraining models from scratch while reducing training time by nearly half. This research demonstrates the potential of CL methods in enhancing real-world engineering workflows by allowing models to learn from sequential data and adapt to new constraints and designs. The code and datasets used in the study will be made available for further exploration and experimentation.

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

Summary: <br />
The proposed method, Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" to reduce peak memory usage during inference for long-context language models. Experiments show MOM can extend the maximum context length and maintain accuracy on various models. It reduces memory consumption significantly, changing research priorities from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage efficiency. MOM achieves over 50% peak memory reduction on average and increases context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU. Compared to traditional methods, MOM offers a 35% greater context length extension and competitive throughput performance due to efficient processing. This breakthrough eliminates prefill memory consumption as a primary bottleneck during inference, highlighting the importance of improving residual KV cache efficiency in future research. <div>

Abstract: Long-context language models exhibit impressive performance but remain challenging to deploy due to high GPU memory demands during inference. We propose Memory-efficient Offloaded Mini-sequence Inference (MOM), a method that partitions critical layers into smaller "mini-sequences" and integrates seamlessly with KV cache offloading. Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\% on average. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k to 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and not compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due to minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared to traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\% greater context length extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill memory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory bottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research priorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to improving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.

<div> generalization, diffusion models, denoising score matching, score function, training distribution

Summary:<br />
- Diffusion models' generalization beyond their training set is not well understood.
- The denoising score matching (DSM) objective used for training is the score function of the training distribution.
- The noisy target used in training impacts the generalization of diffusion models.
- A mathematical theory explains the 'generalization through variance' phenomenon.
- The distributions learned by diffusion models fill in gaps in the training distribution due to the covariance structure of the noisy target.
- Diffusion models sample effectively from distributions that resemble their training distributions.
- The inductive bias of diffusion models is influenced by the covariance structure of the noisy target.
- The inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases. 

<br /><br />Summary: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training data is a mystery, despite being trained on the denoising score matching (DSM) objective. The noisy target in training impacts generalization, leading to a 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. A new mathematical theory explains how diffusion models fill in gaps in the training distribution, influenced by the covariance structure of the noisy target. The learned distributions resemble the training distribution, with an inductive bias from the noisy target and feature-related biases. <div>
arXiv:2504.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases.

Summary:
Safety is a crucial aspect in reinforcement learning (RL), but defining safety constraints can be challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for safe RL where the true safety definition is unknown. By utilizing a safety model that performs credit assignment based on labeled data, the impact of each decision step on overall safety can be estimated. The architecture of the safety model allows for separate safety scores at each timestep, enabling effective learning. The safe RL problem is reformulated using this model, leading to the development of an algorithm to optimize a policy that is both safe and rewarding. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this approach in various continuous control tasks. Overall, this research contributes to addressing safety concerns in RL scenarios where safety definitions are unclear or difficult to specify. 

<br /><br />Summary: Safety in reinforcement learning can be challenging to define, especially in scenarios where safety constraints are unknown. In this study, a safety model is introduced to estimate the impact of decision steps on overall safety based on labeled data. By reformulating the safe RL problem and developing an algorithm to optimize safe yet rewarding policies, this approach proves effective in satisfying unknown safety definitions. The architecture of the safety model allows for separate safety scores at each timestep, enhancing learning capabilities. Empirical results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of this method in various continuous control tasks, highlighting its potential for enhancing safety in RL environments. <div>

Abstract: In safe reinforcement learning (RL), auxiliary safety costs are used to align the agent to safe decision making. In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.

Summary: 
- Flood forecasting is crucial for early warning systems, with machine learning (ML) models proving to be effective when trained on large, diverse datasets.
- Global training of ML models can lead to a loss of ownership for national forecasters, hindering their ability to adapt models for local improvements.
- Local data, accessible only to local agencies, is valuable for enhancing model performance, as suggested by traditional hydrology research.
- The methodology of pre-training a model on a global dataset and fine-tuning it on local basin data can lead to performance increases, particularly in underperforming watersheds during global training.
- The study provides a roadmap for national forecasters to take control of global models using their own data, facilitating the operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floods are the most common form of natural disaster and accurate flood forecasting is essential for early warning systems. Previous work has shown that machine learning (ML) models are a promising way to improve flood predictions when trained on large, geographically-diverse datasets. This requirement of global training can result in a loss of ownership for national forecasters who cannot easily adapt the models to improve performance in their region, preventing ML models from being operationally deployed. Furthermore, traditional hydrology research with physics-based models suggests that local data -- which in many cases is only accessible to local agencies -- is valuable for improving model performance. To address these concerns, we demonstrate a methodology of pre-training a model on a large, global dataset and then fine-tuning that model on data from individual basins. This results in performance increases, validating our hypothesis that there is extra information to be captured in local data. In particular, we show that performance increases are most significant in watersheds that underperform during global training. We provide a roadmap for national forecasters who wish to take ownership of global models using their own data, aiming to lower the barrier to operational deployment of ML-based hydrological forecast systems.

Summary: 
Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) is proposed as an efficient alternative to Hebbian learning in the context of associative memories in neural networks. Unlike iterative methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR), KRR learns dual variables non-iteratively through a closed-form solution, significantly reducing training time. Experimental results show that KRR achieves a high storage capacity, with a ratio of 1.5, and robustness against noise, recalling patterns even when corrupted by up to 80%. This performance is comparable to KLR, demonstrating the effectiveness of KRR in building high-performance associative memories efficiently. The study highlights the speed advantages of KRR in comparison to traditional iteratively learning methods, positioning it as a promising approach for efficiently implementing associative memory capabilities in neural networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO) is introduced as a hybrid algorithm combining neuroevolution with policy gradient methods to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning. EPO integrates the global exploration strengths of evolutionary computation with the local optimization capabilities of policy gradient methods, offering a solution to the dilemma in RL. Experimental evaluations on Atari Pong and Breakout benchmarks demonstrate that EPO enhances policy quality and sample efficiency compared to standard policy gradient and evolutionary computation methods. The results indicate EPO's effectiveness in tasks requiring both exploration and local optimization, highlighting its potential for improving performance in reinforcement learning scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency. Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained, gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.

Summary: 
MagMatch introduces a novel framework for Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) that isolates out-of-distribution (OOD) samples using a prototype-based contrastive learning approach. Unlike existing methods, MagMatch does not assign prototypes to OOD samples, instead selectively aligning in-distribution (ID) samples with class prototypes through an ID-Selective Magnetic (ISM) module. This allows OOD samples to remain unaligned in the feature space. The framework also uses Selective Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which adjusts alignment dynamically based on sample confidence. Through extensive experiments on various datasets, MagMatch demonstrates superior performance in closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in generalizing to unseen OOD data. This approach offers a promising solution to the challenge of learning from mixed unlabeled data with both ID and OOD classes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) tackles the practical challenge of learning from unlabeled data that may include both in-distribution (ID) and unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. However, existing OSSL methods form suboptimal feature spaces by either excluding OOD samples, interfering with them, or overtrusting their information during training. In this work, we introduce MagMatch, a novel framework that naturally isolates OOD samples through a prototype-based contrastive learning paradigm. Unlike conventional methods, MagMatch does not assign any prototypes to OOD samples; instead, it selectively aligns ID samples with class prototypes using an ID-Selective Magnetic (ISM) module, while allowing OOD samples - the "others" - to remain unaligned in the feature space. To support this process, we propose Selective Magnetic Alignment (SMA) loss for unlabeled data, which dynamically adjusts alignment based on sample confidence. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that MagMatch significantly outperforms existing methods in both closed-set classification accuracy and OOD detection AUROC, especially in generalizing to unseen OOD data.

Summary: <br />
Federated learning allows collaborative training of deep learning models while preserving client data privacy. The traditional weighted averaging aggregation method based on client data volume declaration is susceptible to model bias due to dishonest clients. To tackle this issue, a new secure Federated Data Quantity-aware weighted averaging method (FedDua) is proposed. This approach enables servers to predict client data quantities accurately using local model gradients, enhancing global model performance by an average of 3.17% compared to existing methods in the presence of inaccurate data declarations. FedDua can be seamlessly integrated into various federated learning algorithms involving server-side aggregation, ensuring more reliable and efficient model training. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDua in enhancing model performance while addressing the challenges posed by inaccurate client data volume reporting. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of deep learning models without requiring data to leave local clients, thereby preserving client privacy. The aggregation process on the server plays a critical role in the performance of the resulting FL model. The most commonly used aggregation method is weighted averaging based on the amount of data from each client, which is thought to reflect each client's contribution. However, this method is prone to model bias, as dishonest clients might report inaccurate training data volumes to the server, which is hard to verify. To address this issue, we propose a novel secure \underline{Fed}erated \underline{D}ata q\underline{u}antity-\underline{a}ware weighted averaging method (FedDua). It enables FL servers to accurately predict the amount of training data from each client based on their local model gradients uploaded. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into any FL algorithms that involve server-side model aggregation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarking datasets demonstrate that FedDua improves the global model performance by an average of 3.17% compared to four popular FL aggregation methods in the presence of inaccurate client data volume declarations.

Summary: 
Chemical kinetic model inference for combustion problems is complex due to large ODE systems and varied time scales. Traditional machine learning techniques struggle with the nonlinearity and numerical stiffness of these models. A novel approach, ChemKANs, combines the KAN-ODE framework with physical laws and an elemental conservation loss term, providing streamlined training and high accuracy predictions. ChemKANs show no overfitting and can accurately model hydrogen combustion with minimal parameters, offering a 2x acceleration over detailed chemistry in simulations. This demonstrates the scalability and potential of ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics, highlighting their applicability to larger and more challenging problems. <div>
arXiv:2504.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application for combustion problems is challenging due to large ODE systems and wideley separated time scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy data sources makes their application challenging. The recently developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and KAN ordinary differential equations (KAN-ODEs) have been demonstrated as powerful tools for scientific applications thanks to their rapid neural scaling, improved interpretability, and smooth activation functions. Here, we develop ChemKANs by augmenting the KAN-ODE framework with physical knowledge of the flow of information through the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws, as well as an elemental conservation loss term. This novel framework encodes strong inductive bias that enables streamlined training and higher accuracy predictions, while facilitating parameter sparsity through full sharing of information across all inputs and outputs. In a model inference investigation, we find that ChemKANs exhibit no overfitting or model degradation when tasked with extracting predictive models from data that is both sparse and noisy, a task that a standard DeepONet struggles to accomplish. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN (only 344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry, providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations indicate potential for ChemKANs in combustion physics and chemical kinetics, and demonstrate the scalability of generic KAN-ODEs in significantly larger and more numerically challenging problems than previously studied.

<div> Discrimination-aware classification, fairness constraints, decision tree learners, GroupCART, multi-task learning<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Discrimination-aware classification techniques aim to ensure fair predictions by considering protected attributes like gender and ethnicity. Traditional decision tree algorithms focus solely on information gain in the target attribute, potentially leading to biased models. In contrast, GroupCART, a tree-based ensemble optimizer, balances predictive accuracy with fairness by simultaneously optimizing for decreased entropy in the target attribute and increased entropy in protected attributes. Without requiring data transformation, GroupCART produces fairer models with minimal performance trade-offs. Additionally, the method allows for customizable weighting, enabling users to adjust the balance between predictive accuracy and fairness according to their needs. Overall, GroupCART demonstrates that algorithmic bias in decision tree models can be alleviated through multi-task, fairness-aware learning. <div>
arXiv:2504.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrimination-aware classification aims to make accurate predictions while satisfying fairness constraints. Traditional decision tree learners typically optimize for information gain in the target attribute alone, which can result in models that unfairly discriminate against protected social groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose GroupCART, a tree-based ensemble optimizer that avoids bias during model construction by optimizing not only for decreased entropy in the target attribute but also for increased entropy in protected attributes. Our experiments show that GroupCART achieves fairer models without data transformation and with minimal performance degradation. Furthermore, the method supports customizable weighting, offering a smooth and flexible trade-off between predictive performance and fairness based on user requirements. These results demonstrate that algorithmic bias in decision tree models can be mitigated through multi-task, fairness-aware learning.

Summary: 
The study introduces modifications to the plain Transformer model to make it suitable for graph learning without complex architectural changes. The proposed modifications include using simplified $L_2$ attention to measure token closeness, adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitudes, and a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder. These modifications improve performance across various graph datasets. The research highlights significant gains in expressiveness in the graph isomorphism task. The study demonstrates that these simple modifications to the Transformer architecture can make it applicable to graph learning tasks and achieve notable performance improvements in graph-related applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Transformers have attained outstanding performance across various modalities, employing scaled-dot-product (SDP) attention mechanisms. Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1) simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder. Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in the graph isomorphism.

<div> Keywords: LLM ensembles, judgment distribution, maximum a posteriori framework, adaptive stopping, BetaConform

Summary: 
The paper introduces a maximum a posteriori framework for accurately estimating the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. It proposes a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution, enhancing over the traditional Binomial distribution. An adaptive stopping approach based on conformal prediction allows for efficient iterative sampling while maintaining accuracy. A prior transfer mechanism leverages distributions from open-source datasets to improve estimation on target datasets with limited annotations. The BetaConform framework integrates these components, providing a theoretically guaranteed estimation of LLM ensemble judgment with minimal labeled samples. Empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of BetaConform, enabling precise performance assessment of LLM judges with minimal data requirements. With as few as 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset, BetaConform can estimate performance with an error margin as small as 3.37%.

arXiv:2504.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM ensembles are widely used for LLM judges. However, how to estimate their accuracy, especially in an efficient way, is unknown. In this paper, we present a principled maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework for an economical and precise estimation of the performance of LLM ensemble judgment. We first propose a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the judgment distribution, revising from the vanilla Binomial distribution. Next, we introduce a conformal prediction-driven approach that enables adaptive stopping during iterative sampling to balance accuracy with efficiency. Furthermore, we design a prior transfer mechanism that utilizes learned distributions on open-source datasets to improve estimation on a target dataset when only scarce annotations are available. Finally, we present BetaConform, a framework that integrates our distribution assumption, adaptive stopping, and the prior transfer mechanism to deliver a theoretically guaranteed distribution estimation of LLM ensemble judgment with minimum labeled samples. BetaConform is also validated empirically. For instance, with only 10 samples from the TruthfulQA dataset, for a Llama ensembled judge, BetaConform gauges its performance with error margin as small as 3.37%.

Summary:  
This study examines constraint-based causal discovery algorithms that rely on statistical tests for conditional independence to uncover causal networks. The algorithms assume a correspondence between graphical properties of causal structures and conditional independence properties of observed variables. Due to the finite nature of data, the empirical distribution may be close to, but not identical to, the true distribution. The research investigates the "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties by analyzing the manifolds that constrain the space of possible joint distributions. A measure of this meta-dependence is computed using information projections. Empirical validation is conducted using synthetic and real-world data, highlighting instances where multiple violations of conditional independencies can occur simultaneously. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between conditional independencies in causal networks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery algorithms utilize many statistical tests for conditional independence to uncover networks of causal dependencies. These approaches to causal discovery rely on an assumed correspondence between the graphical properties of a causal structure and the conditional independence properties of observed variables, known as the causal Markov condition and faithfulness. Finite data yields an empirical distribution that is "close" to the actual distribution. Across these many possible empirical distributions, the correspondence to the graphical properties can break down for different conditional independencies, and multiple violations can occur at the same time. We study this "meta-dependence" between conditional independence properties using the following geometric intuition: each conditional independence property constrains the space of possible joint distributions to a manifold. The "meta-dependence" between conditional independences is informed by the position of these manifolds relative to the true probability distribution. We provide a simple-to-compute measure of this meta-dependence using information projections and consolidate our findings empirically using both synthetic and real-world data.

<div> Stochastic Gradient Descent, Convergence Analysis, Machine Learning, Non-convex Optimization, Step-size <br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new analytical framework for analyzing the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in machine learning research. It allows for convergence analysis under more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions, compared to previous studies. The analysis proves almost sure convergence of SGD iterates in the non-convex setting for step-sizes that satisfy specific conditions. The results eliminate the need for global Lipschitz continuity assumption on the loss function and relax boundedness requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Additionally, $L_2$ convergence is established based on the almost sure convergence results. These relaxed assumptions make the theoretical results more general and applicable in practical scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $ \{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t = +\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p < +\infty$ for some $p > 2$. Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence. These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) are intricate biological systems that control gene expression and regulation in response to environmental and developmental cues. Advances in computational biology, coupled with high throughput sequencing technologies, have significantly improved the accuracy of GRN inference and modeling. Modern approaches increasingly leverage artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning techniques including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and contrastive learning to analyze large scale omics data and uncover regulatory gene interactions. To support both the application of GRN inference in studying gene regulation and the development of novel machine learning methods, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning based GRN inference methodologies, along with the datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used. Special emphasis is placed on the emerging role of cutting edge deep learning techniques in enhancing inference performance. The potential future directions for improving GRN inference are also discussed.

Summary:<br />
Machine-learned potentials (MLPs), particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have transformed materials discovery by accurately predicting molecular and material properties. While GNNs excel in capturing complex atomic interactions, they struggle with out-of-domain data, leading to unreliable predictions. To address this issue, the study explores Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a more computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, the research assesses its ability to provide dependable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets. The results show that DPOSE effectively differentiates between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, displaying higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This research underscores the potential of lightweight UQ methods in enhancing the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and sets the groundwork for future integration with active learning strategies.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have revolutionized materials discovery by providing accurate and efficient predictions of molecular and material properties. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach due to their ability to capture complex atomic interactions. However, GNNs often produce unreliable predictions when encountering out-of-domain data and it is difficult to identify when that happens. To address this challenge, we explore Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques, focusing on Direct Propagation of Shallow Ensembles (DPOSE) as a computationally efficient alternative to deep ensembles. By integrating DPOSE into the SchNet model, we assess its ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates across diverse Density Functional Theory datasets, including QM9, OC20, and Gold Molecular Dynamics. Our findings often demonstrate that DPOSE successfully distinguishes between in-domain and out-of-domain samples, exhibiting higher uncertainty for unobserved molecule and material classes. This work highlights the potential of lightweight UQ methods in improving the robustness of GNN-based materials modeling and lays the foundation for future integration with active learning strategies.

Summary:
Hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models were compared with classical deep learning (C-DL) models for robustness against adversarial attacks in autonomous vehicle perception modules. Transfer learning models, alexnet and vgg-16, were used as feature extractors before being fed into the quantum system. Over 1000 quantum circuits were tested for three untargeted adversarial approaches: projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack (FGSA), and gradient attack (GA). Results showed that HCQ-DL models maintained high accuracy levels above 95% in no-attack scenarios and above 91% for GA and FGSA attacks, outperforming C-DL models. During the PGD attack, the alexnet-based HCQ-DL model achieved 85% accuracy compared to C-DL models with accuracies below 21%. This study demonstrates that HCQ-DL models offer improved accuracy for traffic sign classification in adversarial settings, making them a valuable tool for AV perception modules. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based image classification models are essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) perception modules since incorrect categorization might have severe repercussions. Adversarial attacks are widely studied cyberattacks that can lead DL models to predict inaccurate output, such as incorrectly classified traffic signs by the perception module of an autonomous vehicle. In this study, we create and compare hybrid classical-quantum deep learning (HCQ-DL) models with classical deep learning (C-DL) models to demonstrate robustness against adversarial attacks for perception modules. Before feeding them into the quantum system, we used transfer learning models, alexnet and vgg-16, as feature extractors. We tested over 1000 quantum circuits in our HCQ-DL models for projected gradient descent (PGD), fast gradient sign attack (FGSA), and gradient attack (GA), which are three well-known untargeted adversarial approaches. We evaluated the performance of all models during adversarial attacks and no-attack scenarios. Our HCQ-DL models maintain accuracy above 95\% during a no-attack scenario and above 91\% for GA and FGSA attacks, which is higher than C-DL models. During the PGD attack, our alexnet-based HCQ-DL model maintained an accuracy of 85\% compared to C-DL models that achieved accuracies below 21\%. Our results highlight that the HCQ-DL models provide improved accuracy for traffic sign classification under adversarial settings compared to their classical counterparts.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new feature selection method, FSCPU, designed specifically for positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenarios where only a few positive labels are available. FSCPU takes into account the clustering of positive labels in data to improve feature selection accuracy. By formulating feature selection as a binary optimization task and incorporating the cluster assumption, FSCPU shows effectiveness in various data conditions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate FSCPU's superiority compared to conventional methods. Additionally, performance comparisons on open datasets reveal FSCPU's competitive edge in downstream classification tasks, even when the cluster assumption is not strictly met. Overall, FSCPU offers a promising solution for efficient feature selection in PU learning scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

Summary:
VLMGuard-R1 introduces a novel approach to enhancing safety in Vision-Language Models by using multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. The framework refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to strengthen safety across various VLM architectures without changing their core parameters. A three-stage reasoning pipeline is developed to create a dataset that trains the rewriter to identify subtle threats and provide tailored responses instead of generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines, achieving a significant 43.59% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark. This proactive framework aims to align VLMs with safety standards by preempting intricate vulnerabilities through reasoning-driven prompt refinement.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Drivers' perception of risk determines their acceptance, trust, and use of the Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). However, perceived risk is subjective and difficult to evaluate using existing methods. To address this issue, a driver's subjective perceived risk (DSPR) model is proposed, regarding perceived risk as a dynamically triggered mechanism with anisotropy and attenuation. 20 participants are recruited for a driver-in-the-loop experiment to report their real-time subjective risk ratings (SRRs) when experiencing various automatic driving scenarios. A convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network with temporal pattern attention (CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA) is embedded into a semi-supervised learning strategy to predict SRRs, aiming to reduce data noise caused by subjective randomness of participants. The results illustrate that DSPR achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 87.91% in predicting SRRs, compared to three state-of-the-art risk models. The semi-supervised strategy improves accuracy by 20.12%. Besides, CNN-Bi-LSTM-TPA network presents the highest accuracy among four different LSTM structures. This study offers an effective method for assessing driver's perceived risk, providing support for the safety enhancement of ADS and driver's trust improvement.

Constrained Learning, a new paradigm for physics-informed neural networks, allows for the approximation of first-order derivatives using non-time course or partially observed data. MPOCtrL, an optimization approach tailored for Constrained Learning, balances fitting physical models and observed data. The framework effectively detects nonlinear dependencies between observed data and the underlying physical properties of a system.

arXiv:2504.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) models the dynamics of a system by integrating the governing physical laws into the architecture of a neural network. By enforcing physical laws as constraints, PINN overcomes challenges with data scarsity and potentially high dimensionality. Existing PINN frameworks rely on fully observed time-course data, the acquisition of which could be prohibitive for many systems. In this study, we developed a new PINN learning paradigm, namely Constrained Learning, that enables the approximation of first-order derivatives or motions using non-time course or partially observed data. Computational principles and a general mathematical formulation of Constrained Learning were developed. We further introduced MPOCtrL (Message Passing Optimization-based Constrained Learning) an optimization approach tailored for the Constrained Learning framework that strives to balance the fitting of physical models and observed data. Its code is available at github link: https://github.com/ptdang1001/MPOCtrL Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrated that MPOCtrL can effectively detect the nonlinear dependency between observed data and the underlying physical properties of the system. In particular, on the task of metabolic flux analysis, MPOCtrL outperforms all existing data-driven flux estimators.

Summary:
- The study examines continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks using gradient descent for a fixed number of iterations per task.
- When tasks are jointly linearly separable and presented in a cyclic/random order, the trained linear classifier converges towards the joint max-margin solution.
- Gradient descent training on a single task is biased towards individual max-margin solutions, but joint max-margin solution direction can differ significantly.
- Analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting when tasks are given cyclically reveals the relationship between task alignment, catastrophic forgetting, and knowledge transfer.
- Forgetting decreases as the cycle repeats, ultimately vanishing to zero.
- In cases where tasks are not jointly separable, the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions. Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1) alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.

This paper introduces a novel approach using Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) in graph self-supervised learning. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of vector quantization in enhancing a graph autoencoder's ability to capture graph topology. It addresses challenges such as codebook underutilization and codebook space sparsity by proposing an annealing-based encoding strategy and a hierarchical two-layer codebook. The model outperforms 16 baseline methods in self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks on various datasets. The annealing-based encoding strategy promotes broad code utilization early in training and focuses on effective codes later. The hierarchical two-layer codebook captures relationships between embeddings, encouraging the model to learn closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology. <div>
arXiv:2504.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently. However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders, demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Recent deep learning models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) often emphasize complex, handcrafted designs, while simpler architectures like linear models or MLPs have often outperformed these intricate solutions. In this paper, we revisit and organize the core ideas behind several key techniques, such as redundancy reduction and multi-scale modeling, which are frequently employed in advanced LTSF models. Our goal is to streamline these ideas for more efficient deep learning utilization. To this end, we introduce TimeCapsule, a model built around the principle of high-dimensional information compression that unifies these techniques in a generalized yet simplified framework. Specifically, we model time series as a 3D tensor, incorporating temporal, variate, and level dimensions, and leverage mode production to capture multi-mode dependencies while achieving dimensionality compression. We propose an internal forecast within the compressed representation domain, supported by the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), to monitor the learning of predictive representations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the versatility of our method, showing that TimeCapsule can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper discusses the challenges of high-dimensional multi-label learning in artificial intelligence and introduces a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection) to address them. The curse of dimensionality is a major bottleneck in high-dimensional multi-label learning, but GPMFS aims to overcome it through a combination of global feature identification and personalized feature selection. By identifying global features shared across all labels and supplementing each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features, GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining interpretability and robustness. The method demonstrates the importance of considering label-specific information in feature selection, showing promising results on real-world datasets. GPMFS provides insights into label-specific strength and highlights the potential applicability of personalized optimization approaches in multi-label learning. <div>

Abstract: As artificial intelligence methods are increasingly applied to complex task scenarios, high dimensional multi-label learning has emerged as a prominent research focus. At present, the curse of dimensionality remains one of the major bottlenecks in high-dimensional multi-label learning, which can be effectively addressed through multi-label feature selection methods. However, existing multi-label feature selection methods mostly focus on identifying global features shared across all labels, which overlooks personalized characteristics and specific requirements of individual labels. This global-only perspective may limit the ability to capture label-specific discriminative information, thereby affecting overall performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called GPMFS (Global Foundation and Personalized Optimization for Multi-Label Feature Selection). GPMFS firstly identifies global features by exploiting label correlations, then adaptively supplements each label with a personalized subset of discriminative features using a threshold-controlled strategy. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GPMFS achieves superior performance while maintaining strong interpretability and robustness. Furthermore, GPMFS provides insights into the label-specific strength across different multi-label datasets, thereby demonstrating the necessity and potential applicability of personalized feature selection approaches.

<br />Summary: <br /> 
Decentralized Nonconvex Composite Federated Learning (DNCFL) is a promising area of research that addresses the challenges of nonconvex optimization problems in federated learning. The novel algorithm DEPOSITUM proposed in this paper leverages proximal stochastic gradient tracking to approximate global gradients and reduce variance in gradient estimation. By introducing momentums in the gradient descent step and supporting local updates, DEPOSITUM effectively manages data heterogeneity and minimizes communication costs. Theoretical analysis proves its efficiency by achieving an expected stationary point with a low iteration complexity. DEPOSITUM exhibits sublinear convergence rates for key performance metrics, enabling network-independent linear speedup without mega-batch sampling. Empirical evaluations on neural network training demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and superiority over existing federated optimization methods. <div>
arXiv:2504.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning, attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients. Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables, significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient, consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Summary:
Sign-In is a new approach proposed to address the performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch (PaI) and dense-to-sparse training in deep learning. The method focuses on finding correct parameter signs, which are crucial for PaI but often elusive. Sign-In utilizes dynamic reparameterization to induce sign flips, which complement the effects of dense-to-sparse training. Experimental results and theoretical analysis suggest that Sign-In can lead to performance improvements for PaI. However, the main challenge still remains in closing the performance gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training. This highlights the need for further research in optimizing parameter initialization techniques for efficient deep learning models.

Abstract: The performance gap between training sparse neural networks from scratch (PaI) and dense-to-sparse training presents a major roadblock for efficient deep learning. According to the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, PaI hinges on finding a problem specific parameter initialization. As we show, to this end, determining correct parameter signs is sufficient. Yet, they remain elusive to PaI. To address this issue, we propose Sign-In, which employs a dynamic reparameterization that provably induces sign flips. Such sign flips are complementary to the ones that dense-to-sparse training can accomplish, rendering Sign-In as an orthogonal method. While our experiments and theory suggest performance improvements of PaI, they also carve out the main open challenge to close the gap between PaI and dense-to-sparse training.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Permutation Decision Trees (PDT) and strategic trailing for predicting stock market movements and executing profitable trades in the Indian stock market. We focus on high-frequency data using 5-minute candlesticks for the top 50 stocks listed in the NIFTY 50 index. We implement a trading strategy that aims to buy stocks at lower prices and sell them at higher prices, capitalizing on short-term market fluctuations. Due to regulatory constraints in India, short selling is not considered in our strategy. The model incorporates various technical indicators and employs hyperparameters such as the trailing stop-loss value and support thresholds to manage risk effectively. Our results indicate that the proposed trading bot has the potential to outperform the market average and yield returns higher than the risk-free rate offered by 10-year Indian government bonds. We trained and tested data on a 60 day dataset provided by Yahoo Finance. Specifically, 12 days for testing and 48 days for training. Our bot based on permutation decision tree achieved a profit of 1.3468 % over a 12-day testing period, where as a bot based on LSTM gave a return of 0.1238 % over a 12-day testing period and a bot based on RNN gave a return of 0.3096 % over a 12-day testing period. All of the bots outperform the buy-and-hold strategy, which resulted in a loss of 2.2508 %.

arXiv:2504.12849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows collaborative training among multiple devices without data sharing, thus enabling privacy-sensitive applications on mobile or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as mobile health and asset tracking. However, designing an FL system with good model utility that works with low computation/communication overhead on heterogeneous, resource-constrained mobile/IoT devices is challenging. To address this problem, this paper proposes FedX, a novel adaptive model decomposition and quantization FL system for IoT. To balance utility with resource constraints on IoT devices, FedX decomposes a global FL model into different sub-networks with adaptive numbers of quantized bits for different devices. The key idea is that a device with fewer resources receives a smaller sub-network for lower overhead but utilizes a larger number of quantized bits for higher model utility, and vice versa. The quantization operations in FedX are done at the server to reduce the computational load on devices. FedX iteratively minimizes the losses in the devices' local data and in the server's public data using quantized sub-networks under a regularization term, and thus it maximizes the benefits of combining FL with model quantization through knowledge sharing among the server and devices in a cost-effective training process. Extensive experiments show that FedX significantly improves quantization times by up to 8.43X, on-device computation time by 1.5X, and total end-to-end training time by 1.36X, compared with baseline FL systems. We guarantee the global model convergence theoretically and validate local model convergence empirically, highlighting FedX's optimization efficiency.

The process involves feature selection with random forest and outlier detection with DBSCAN. Experiments show the model's exceptional performance with an AUC score exceeding 0.99 and a high G-means score of 0.99, demonstrating its robustness. The F1-score consistently exceeds 0.967, indicating its effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets. The Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe model proves to be a promising solution for noise reduction and outlier handling, leading to improved classification models. <div>

Abstract: Classifying imbalanced datasets remains a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly with big data where instances are unevenly distributed among classes, leading to class imbalance issues that impact classifier performance. While Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) addresses this challenge by generating new instances for the under-represented minority class, it faces obstacles in the form of noise and outliers during the creation of new samples. In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses the limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This process involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify the most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers based on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority classes are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent oversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of the proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of 0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently exceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a formidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise reduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.

Summary:
The research introduces new vulnerabilities in federated learning (FL) due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients. A collaborative backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois is developed, where a pre-trained model with a Trojan is distributed to compromised clients to manipulate FL model training. This attack involves only a limited number of compromised clients and evades detection by existing defenses. CollaPois amplifies the impact of the Trojan, especially in scenarios with diverse data distributions among clients. The attack remains effective even with a small number of compromised clients and poses a higher risk to clients with locally aligned data. Experimental results show the superiority of CollaPois over existing backdoor attacks in FL settings, highlighting the need for robust defenses to mitigate such vulnerabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training using decentralized private data from multiple clients. While FL has shown robustness against poisoning attacks with basic defenses, our research reveals new vulnerabilities stemming from non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among clients. These vulnerabilities pose a substantial risk of model poisoning in real-world FL scenarios.
  To demonstrate such vulnerabilities, we develop a novel collaborative backdoor poisoning attack called CollaPois. In this attack, we distribute a single pre-trained model infected with a Trojan to a group of compromised clients. These clients then work together to produce malicious gradients, causing the FL model to consistently converge towards a low-loss region centered around the Trojan-infected model. Consequently, the impact of the Trojan is amplified, especially when the benign clients have diverse local data distributions and scattered local gradients. CollaPois stands out by achieving its goals while involving only a limited number of compromised clients, setting it apart from existing attacks. Also, CollaPois effectively avoids noticeable shifts or degradation in the FL model's performance on legitimate data samples, allowing it to operate stealthily and evade detection by advanced robust FL algorithms.
  Thorough theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CollaPois compared to state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. Notably, CollaPois bypasses existing backdoor defenses, especially in scenarios where clients possess diverse data distributions. Moreover, the results show that CollaPois remains effective even when involving a small number of compromised clients. Notably, clients whose local data is closely aligned with compromised clients experience higher risks of backdoor infections.

Bird sound classification, crucial for environmental health assessment, presents unique challenges that general-purpose models struggle to address.

The study also introduces prototypical probing, a resource-efficient approach for leveraging frozen representations of MAEs. Bird-MAE's prototypical probes outperform linear probing by up to 37% in mean average precision (MAP), closing the gap with fine-tuning to approximately 3% on average on BirdSet. <div>

Summary:
Implicit bias and explicit regularization are essential in understanding how overparameterized models generalize well. This study integrates explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework to analyze its impact on the geometry of training dynamics. Three key effects are studied: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. The analysis covers various problems like sparse coding, matrix sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA. The lasting effect of regularization is explored, leading to the proposal of switching off weight decay during training to potentially improve generalization. Experimental results support the idea that dynamic weight decay schedules can enhance model performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit bias plays an important role in explaining how overparameterized models generalize well. Explicit regularization like weight decay is often employed in addition to prevent overfitting. While both concepts have been studied separately, in practice, they often act in tandem. Understanding their interplay is key to controlling the shape and strength of implicit bias, as it can be modified by explicit regularization. To this end, we incorporate explicit regularization into the mirror flow framework and analyze its lasting effects on the geometry of the training dynamics, covering three distinct effects: positional bias, type of bias, and range shrinking. Our analytical approach encompasses a broad class of problems, including sparse coding, matrix sensing, single-layer attention, and LoRA, for which we demonstrate the utility of our insights. To exploit the lasting effect of regularization and highlight the potential benefit of dynamic weight decay schedules, we propose to switch off weight decay during training, which can improve generalization, as we demonstrate in experiments.

<div> learning behavior, transformer models, in-context learning, stochastic gradient descent, analytical characterization

Summary: 
Transformer models demonstrate remarkable in-context learning (ICL) abilities, adapting to new tasks based on context. Through an analytical study of a simplified linear transformer model performing regression tasks, key insights were uncovered. The study revealed a natural separation of timescales based on input data covariance, resulting in staged learning. The analysis also provided an exact description of ICL development, including fixed points representing learned algorithms and conservation laws governing dynamics. Surprisingly, nonlinear learning behavior was observed in the linear model. The findings suggest that this behavior may extend to nonlinear models as well. Additionally, theory-inspired macroscopic measures were introduced to explain the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and delayed generalization in modular arithmetic models. This work provides a precise dynamical model for understanding ICL and tools for analyzing complex transformer training. <div>

Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Summary:
This article introduces a new unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the sliced-Wasserstein distance for training data selection in machine learning applications. It is particularly useful for critical sectors like power systems, offering conservative data selection and an optimal transport interpretation. The method includes two efficient approximations for scalability: processing reduced-cardinality representations of datasets concurrently and using a computationally light Euclidian distance approximation. The article also presents a first dataset on localized critical peak rebate demand response in a northern climate and showcases the filtering patterns of the method on synthetic datasets. Numerical benchmarking for training data selection and a forecasting benchmark for the open-source dataset are also demonstrated. <div>

Abstract: We propose a new unsupervised anomaly detection method based on the sliced-Wasserstein distance for training data selection in machine learning approaches. Our filtering technique is interesting for decision-making pipelines deploying machine learning models in critical sectors, e.g., power systems, as it offers a conservative data selection and an optimal transport interpretation. To ensure the scalability of our method, we provide two efficient approximations. The first approximation processes reduced-cardinality representations of the datasets concurrently. The second makes use of a computationally light Euclidian distance approximation. Additionally, we open the first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in a northern climate. We present the filtering patterns of our method on synthetic datasets and numerically benchmark our method for training data selection. Finally, we employ our method as part of a first forecasting benchmark for our open-source dataset.

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using wrist-worn inertial sensors to automate the labeling of ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) items. While the ARAT is commonly used to assess upper limb motor function, its limitations include subjectivity and time consumption of clinical staff. By using IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and MiniROCKET as a time series classification technique, this investigation aims to classify ARAT items based on sensor recordings. We test common preprocessing strategies to efficiently leverage included information in the data. Afterward, we use the best preprocessing to improve the classification. The dataset includes recordings of 45 participants performing various ARAT items. Results show that MiniROCKET offers a fast and reliable approach for classifying ARAT domains, although challenges remain in distinguishing between individual resembling items. Future work may involve improving classification through more advanced machine-learning models and data enhancements.

<title>RL-PINNs: Reinforcement Learning-Driven Adaptive Sampling for Efficient Training of PINNs</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their performance heavily relies on the strategy used to select training points. Conventional adaptive sampling methods, such as residual-based refinement, often require multi-round sampling and repeated retraining of PINNs, leading to computational inefficiency due to redundant points and costly gradient computations-particularly in high-dimensional or high-order derivative scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose RL-PINNs, a reinforcement learning(RL)-driven adaptive sampling framework that enables efficient training with only a single round of sampling. Our approach formulates adaptive sampling as a Markov decision process, where an RL agent dynamically selects optimal training points by maximizing a long-term utility metric. Critically, we replace gradient-dependent residual metrics with a computationally efficient function variation as the reward signal, eliminating the overhead of derivative calculations. Furthermore, we employ a delayed reward mechanism to prioritize long-term training stability over short-term gains. Extensive experiments across diverse PDE benchmarks, including low-regular, nonlinear, high-dimensional, and high-order problems, demonstrate that RL-PINNs significantly outperforms existing residual-driven adaptive methods in accuracy. Notably, RL-PINNs achieve this with negligible sampling overhead, making them scalable to high-dimensional and high-order problems.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications but demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance due to high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, which are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce a virtual machine (VM) designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, enabling support for low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths while maintaining GPU programmability. The proposed VM features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. VM programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs with automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VM efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels on their supported types. Compared to existing compilers like Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, our VM achieves performance improvements of 1.75x, 2.61x, 1.29x and 1.03x, respectively.

<title>Why Ask One When You Can Ask $k$? Two-Stage Learning-to-Defer to a Set of Experts</title>

arXiv:2504.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-to-Defer (L2D) enables decision-making systems to improve reliability by selectively deferring uncertain predictions to more competent agents. However, most existing approaches focus exclusively on single-agent deferral, which is often inadequate in high-stakes scenarios that require collective expertise. We propose Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, a generalization of the classical two-stage L2D framework that allocates each query to the $k$ most confident agents instead of a single one. To further enhance flexibility and cost-efficiency, we introduce Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive extension that learns the optimal number of agents to consult for each query, based on input complexity, agent competency distributions, and consultation costs. For both settings, we derive a novel surrogate loss and prove that it is Bayes-consistent and $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$-consistent, ensuring convergence to the Bayes-optimal allocation. Notably, we show that the well-established model cascades paradigm arises as a restricted instance of our Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ formulations. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful technique to improve in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs) by breaking complex reasoning into intermediate steps. However, the ability of CoT to generalize under distribution shift remains poorly understood. In this work, we extend a latent-variable framework for CoT prompting and study its behavior on two prototypical out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios: (i) the latent variables for CoT steps are permuted into novel combinations, and (ii) the latent variables uniformly scaled by a factor. Our experiments demonstrate that CoT inference generalizes effectively to OOD samples whose latent variables closely resemble those seen during training, but its performance degrades as this similarity decreases. These findings provide foundational insights into the strengths and limitations of CoT prompting under OOD conditions and suggest directions for developing more resilient reasoning strategies in future LLMs.

<title>Inference-friendly Graph Compression for Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

<title>An All-Atom Generative Model for Designing Protein Complexes</title>

Abstract: Proteins typically exist in complexes, interacting with other proteins or biomolecules to perform their specific biological roles. Research on single-chain protein modeling has been extensively and deeply explored, with advancements seen in models like the series of ESM and AlphaFold. Despite these developments, the study and modeling of multi-chain proteins remain largely uncharted, though they are vital for understanding biological functions. Recognizing the importance of these interactions, we introduce APM (All-Atom Protein Generative Model), a model specifically designed for modeling multi-chain proteins. By integrating atom-level information and leveraging data on multi-chain proteins, APM is capable of precisely modeling inter-chain interactions and designing protein complexes with binding capabilities from scratch. It also performs folding and inverse-folding tasks for multi-chain proteins. Moreover, APM demonstrates versatility in downstream applications: it achieves enhanced performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while also supporting zero-shot sampling in certain tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code will be released at https://github.com/bytedance/apm.

<title>An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research</title>

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH), suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However, current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and optimizers.

Abstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models have demonstrated promising capabilities in capturing complex interactions. However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher. Project page: https://kumarmanas.github.io/SHIFT/.

Abstract: While convolution and self-attention mechanisms have dominated architectural design in deep learning, this survey examines a fundamental yet understudied primitive: the Hadamard product. Despite its widespread implementation across various applications, the Hadamard product has not been systematically analyzed as a core architectural primitive. We present the first comprehensive taxonomy of its applications in deep learning, identifying four principal domains: higher-order correlation, multimodal data fusion, dynamic representation modulation, and efficient pairwise operations. The Hadamard product's ability to model nonlinear interactions with linear computational complexity makes it particularly valuable for resource-constrained deployments and edge computing scenarios. We demonstrate its natural applicability in multimodal fusion tasks, such as visual question answering, and its effectiveness in representation masking for applications including image inpainting and pruning. This systematic review not only consolidates existing knowledge about the Hadamard product's role in deep learning architectures but also establishes a foundation for future architectural innovations. Our analysis reveals the Hadamard product as a versatile primitive that offers compelling trade-offs between computational efficiency and representational power, positioning it as a crucial component in the deep learning toolkit.

The challenge is even greater for anomaly detection, where unsupervised learning methods are essential to ensure practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose Quorum, the first quantum anomaly detection framework designed for unsupervised learning that operates without requiring any training.

Abstract: Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) has been the focus of a successful eradication programme in Ireland, with the herd-level prevalence declining from 11.3% in 2013 to just 0.2% in 2023. As the country moves toward BVD freedom, the development of predictive models for targeted surveillance becomes increasingly important to mitigate the risk of disease re-emergence. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a range of machine learning algorithms, including binary classification and anomaly detection techniques, for predicting BVD-positive herds using highly imbalanced herd-level data. We conduct an extensive simulation study to assess model performance across varying sample sizes and class imbalance ratios, incorporating resampling, class weighting, and appropriate evaluation metrics (sensitivity, positive predictive value, F1-score and AUC values). Random forests and XGBoost models consistently outperformed other methods, with the random forest model achieving the highest sensitivity and AUC across scenarios, including real-world prediction of 2023 herd status, correctly identifying 219 of 250 positive herds while halving the number of herds that require compared to a blanket-testing strategy.

Abstract: Cold temperatures can cause significant frost damage to fruit crops depending on their resilience, or cold hardiness, which changes throughout the dormancy season. This has led to the development of predictive cold-hardiness models, which help farmers decide when to deploy expensive frost-mitigation measures. Unfortunately, cold-hardiness data for model training is only available for some fruit cultivars due to the need for specialized equipment and expertise. Rather, farmers often do have years of phenological data (e.g. date of budbreak) that they regularly collect for their crops. In this work, we introduce a new transfer-learning framework, Transfer via Auxiliary Labels (TAL), that allows farmers to leverage the phenological data to produce more accurate cold-hardiness predictions, even when no cold-hardiness data is available for their specific crop. The framework assumes a set of source tasks (cultivars) where each has associated primary labels (cold hardiness) and auxiliary labels (phenology). However, the target task (new cultivar) is assumed to only have the auxiliary labels. The goal of TAL is to predict primary labels for the target task via transfer from the source tasks. Surprisingly, despite the vast literature on transfer learning, to our knowledge, the TAL formulation has not been previously addressed. Thus, we propose several new TAL approaches based on model selection and averaging that can leverage recent deep multi-task models for cold-hardiness prediction. Our results on real-world cold-hardiness and phenological data for multiple grape cultivars demonstrate that TAL can leverage the phenological data to improve cold-hardiness predictions in the absence of cold-hardiness data.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real improvements? In pursuit of meaningful and lasting evaluation standards, we propose MIB, a benchmark with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models. MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal pathways or specific causal variables in neural language models. The circuit localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g., attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g., sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and locate model features for a causal variable relevant to the task. Using MIB, we find that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e., standard dimensions of hidden vectors. These findings illustrate that MIB enables meaningful comparisons of methods, and increases our confidence that there has been real progress in the field.

Abstract: Designing efficient and effective architectural backbones has been in the core of research efforts to enhance the capability of foundation models. Inspired by the human cognitive phenomenon of attentional bias-the natural tendency to prioritize certain events or stimuli-we reconceptualize neural architectures, including Transformers, Titans, and modern linear recurrent neural networks as associative memory modules that learn a mapping of keys and values using an internal objective, referred to as attentional bias. Surprisingly, we observed that most existing sequence models leverage either (1) dot-product similarity, or (2) L2 regression objectives as their attentional bias. Going beyond these objectives, we present a set of alternative attentional bias configurations along with their effective approximations to stabilize their training procedure. We then reinterpret forgetting mechanisms in modern deep learning architectures as a form of retention regularization, providing a novel set of forget gates for sequence models. Building upon these insights, we present Miras, a general framework to design deep learning architectures based on four choices of: (i) associative memory architecture, (ii) attentional bias objective, (iii) retention gate, and (iv) memory learning algorithm. We present three novel sequence models-Moneta, Yaad, and Memora-that go beyond the power of existing linear RNNs while maintaining a fast parallelizable training process. Our experiments show different design choices in Miras yield models with varying strengths. For example, certain instances of Miras achieve exceptional performance in special tasks such as language modeling, commonsense reasoning, and recall intensive tasks, even outperforming Transformers and other modern linear recurrent models.

Abstract: We adapt alignment techniques from reasoning LLMs to the task of generating engineering sketch constraints found in computer-aided design (CAD) models. Engineering sketches consist of geometric primitives (e.g. points, lines) connected by constraints (e.g. perpendicular, tangent) that define the relationships between them. For a design to be easily editable, the constraints must effectively capture design intent, ensuring the geometry updates predictably when parameters change. Although current approaches can generate CAD designs, an open challenge remains to align model outputs with design intent, we label this problem `design alignment'. A critical first step towards aligning generative CAD models is to generate constraints which fully-constrain all geometric primitives, without over-constraining or distorting sketch geometry. Using alignment techniques to train an existing constraint generation model with feedback from a constraint solver, we are able to fully-constrain 93% of sketches compared to 34% when using a na\"ive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baseline and only 8.9% without alignment. Our approach can be applied to any existing constraint generation model and sets the stage for further research bridging alignment strategies between the language and design domains.

Abstract: While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents. Our datasets, models, and code are publicly available at https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA.

Abstract: Clinical case reports and discharge summaries may be the most complete and accurate summarization of patient encounters, yet they are finalized, i.e., timestamped after the encounter. Complementary data structured streams become available sooner but suffer from incompleteness. To train models and algorithms on more complete and temporally fine-grained data, we construct a pipeline to phenotype, extract, and annotate time-localized findings within case reports using large language models. We apply our pipeline to generate an open-access textual time series corpus for Sepsis-3 comprising 2,139 case reports from the Pubmed-Open Access (PMOA) Subset. To validate our system, we apply it on PMOA and timeline annotations from I2B2/MIMIC-IV and compare the results to physician-expert annotations. We show high recovery rates of clinical findings (event match rates: O1-preview--0.755, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.753) and strong temporal ordering (concordance: O1-preview--0.932, Llama 3.3 70B Instruct--0.932). Our work characterizes the ability of LLMs to time-localize clinical findings in text, illustrating the limitations of LLM use for temporal reconstruction and providing several potential avenues of improvement via multimodal integration.

Abstract: There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary, can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011 first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data remains an underutilized resource.

Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.

<title>Geographical Context Matters: Bridging Fine and Coarse Spatial Information to Enhance Continental Land Cover Mapping</title>

Abstract: Land use and land cover mapping from Earth Observation (EO) data is a critical tool for sustainable land and resource management. While advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery data, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could enhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global scales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level Representation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel deep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into the land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging fine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region) spatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns from both during training but only requires fine-grained information for inference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land cover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the quality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt several competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale land cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an extrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all biogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region is excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned by our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the geographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that integrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance, with the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and coarse-grained spatial information.

Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

Abstract: Accurate prediction and stabilization of blast furnace temperatures are crucial for optimizing the efficiency and productivity of steel production. Traditional methods often struggle with the complex and non-linear nature of the temperature fluctuations within blast furnaces. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines hybrid quantum machine learning with pulverized coal injection control to address these challenges. By integrating classical machine learning techniques with quantum computing algorithms, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy and achieve more stable temperature control. For this we utilized a unique prediction-based optimization method. Our method leverages quantum-enhanced feature space exploration and the robustness of classical regression models to forecast temperature variations and optimize pulverized coal injection values. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in prediction accuracy over 25 percent and our solution improved temperature stability to +-7.6 degrees of target range from the earlier variance of +-50 degrees, highlighting the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning models in industrial steel production applications.

Abstract: Archetypal analysis (AA) was originally proposed in 1994 by Adele Cutler and Leo Breiman as a computational procedure to extract the distinct aspects called archetypes in observations with each observational record approximated as a mixture (i.e., convex combination) of these archetypes. AA thereby provides straightforward, interpretable, and explainable representations for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, facilitating the understanding of the structure of high-dimensional data with wide applications throughout the sciences. However, AA also faces challenges, particularly as the associated optimization problem is non-convex. This survey provides researchers and data mining practitioners an overview of methodologies and opportunities that AA has to offer surveying the many applications of AA across disparate fields of science, as well as best practices for modeling data using AA and limitations. The survey concludes by explaining important future research directions concerning AA.

Abstract: Mobile robots on construction sites require accurate pose estimation to perform autonomous surveying and inspection missions. Localization in construction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of repetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to apartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus on the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned mesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network is trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in an accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a PointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from a single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the global position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse effects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global positions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our approach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition accuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2 in mean error.

<title>Position: The Most Expensive Part of an LLM should be its Training Data</title>

Abstract: Training a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) is an increasingly expensive endeavor due to growing computational, hardware, energy, and engineering demands. Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study 64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers. In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions that could enable fairer practices in the future.

Abstract: Accurately modeling friction in robotics remains a core challenge, as robotics simulators like Mujoco and PyBullet use simplified friction models or heuristics to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, where these simplifications and approximations can lead to substantial differences between simulated and physical performance. In this paper, we present a physics-informed friction estimation framework that enables the integration of well-established friction models with learnable components-requiring only minimal, generic measurement data. Our approach enforces physical consistency yet retains the flexibility to adapt to real-world complexities. We demonstrate, on an underactuated and nonlinear system, that the learned friction models, trained solely on small and noisy datasets, accurately simulate dynamic friction properties and reduce the sim-to-real gap. Crucially, we show that our approach enables the learned models to be transferable to systems they are not trained on. This ability to generalize across multiple systems streamlines friction modeling for complex, underactuated tasks, offering a scalable and interpretable path toward bridging the sim-to-real gap in robotics and control.

Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown potential in electric-vehicle battery management tasks such as capacity estimation, but their deployment is bottlenecked by poor performance in data-limited scenarios. Sharing battery data among algorithm developers can enable accurate and generalizable data-driven models. However, an effective battery management framework that simultaneously ensures data privacy and fault tolerance is still lacking. This paper proposes a swarm battery management system that unites a decentralized swarm learning (SL) framework and credibility weight-based model merging mechanism to enhance battery capacity estimation in data-limited scenarios while ensuring data privacy and security. The effectiveness of the SL framework is validated on a dataset comprising 66 commercial LiNiCoAlO2 cells cycled under various operating conditions. Specifically, the capacity estimation performance is validated in four cases, including data-balanced, volume-biased, feature-biased, and quality-biased scenarios. Our results show that SL can enhance the estimation accuracy in all data-limited cases and achieve a similar level of accuracy with central learning where large amounts of data are available.

Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random, fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture. Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while deepening our understanding of neural computation.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance the study of AI-augmented reasoning in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), psychology and cognitive science, focusing on the critical task of visual perception. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain. To this end, we leverage established principles and explanations from psychology and cognitive science related to complexity in human visual perception. We use them as guiding principles for the MLLMs to compare and interprete visual content. Our study aims to benchmark MLLMs across various explainability principles relevant to visual perception. Unlike recent approaches that primarily employ advanced deep learning models to predict complexity metrics from visual content, our work does not seek to develop a mere new predictive model. Instead, we propose a novel annotation-free analytical framework to assess utility of MLLMs as cognitive assistants for HCI tasks, using visual perception as a case study. The primary goal is to pave the way for principled study in quantifying and evaluating the interpretability of MLLMs for applications in improving human reasoning capability and uncovering biases in existing perception datasets annotated by humans.

Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules). However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD, increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by $\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions. Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem and MNIST.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of pre-trained knowledge in their parameters, but updating them as real-world information evolves remains a challenge. Existing methodologies and benchmarks primarily target entity substitutions, failing to capture the full breadth of complex real-world dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an automatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an evidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect probes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for any update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called memory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus on self-generated "memory" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs to surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results on two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the best CPT models achieving $<2\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and (2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT) baselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\%$.

Abstract: We propose a robust and scalable framework for variational Bayes (VB) that effectively handles outliers and contamination of arbitrary nature in large datasets. Our approach divides the dataset into disjoint subsets, computes the posterior for each subset, and applies VB approximation independently to these posteriors. The resulting variational posteriors with respect to the subsets are then aggregated using the geometric median of probability measures, computed with respect to the Wasserstein distance. This novel aggregation method yields the Variational Median Posterior (VM-Posterior) distribution. We rigorously demonstrate that the VM-Posterior preserves contraction properties akin to those of the true posterior, while accounting for approximation errors or the variational gap inherent in VB methods. We also provide provable robustness guarantee of the VM-Posterior. Furthermore, we establish a variational Bernstein-von Mises theorem for both multivariate Gaussian distributions with general covariance structures and the mean-field variational family. To facilitate practical implementation, we adapt existing algorithms for computing the VM-Posterior and evaluate its performance through extensive numerical experiments. The results highlight its robustness and scalability, making it a reliable tool for Bayesian inference in the presence of complex, contaminated datasets.

Abstract: To what extent can entire books be extracted from LLMs? Using the Llama 3 70B family of models, and the "prefix-prompting" extraction technique, we were able to auto-regressively reconstruct, with a very high level of similarity, one entire book (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) from just the first 500 tokens. We were also able to obtain high extraction rates on several other books, piece-wise. However, these successes do not extend uniformly to all books. We show that extraction rates of books correlate with book popularity and thus, likely duplication in the training data.
  We also confirm the undoing of mitigations in the instruction-tuned Llama 3.1, following recent work (Nasr et al., 2025). We further find that this undoing comes from changes to only a tiny fraction of weights concentrated primarily in the lower transformer blocks. Our results provide evidence of the limits of current regurgitation mitigation strategies and introduce a framework for studying how fine-tuning affects the retrieval of verbatim memorization in aligned LLMs.

Abstract: Purpose: The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. The use of computer vision approaches for the automatic recognition of perioperative events enables identification of bottlenecks for OR optimization. However, privacy concerns limit the use of computer vision for automated event detection from OR videos, which makes privacy-preserving approaches needed for OR workflow analysis. Methods: We propose a two-stage pipeline for privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. In the first stage, we leverage vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB videos. In the second stage, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. We evaluate this method on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes. Results: Our results indicate that this DT-based approach to the OR event detection model achieves performance on par and sometimes even better than raw RGB video-based models on detecting OR events. Conclusion: DTs enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the sharing of de-identified data across institutions and they can potentially enhance model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

Abstract: Recent smaller language models such Phi-3.5 and Phi-4 rely on synthetic data generated using larger Language models. Questions remain about leveraging synthetic data for other use cases, such as adapting LLMs to specific domains. A key limitation of synthetic data is low diversity, which negatively impacts its downstream applicability for improving other models. To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.
  Continually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data. Our findings suggest that a few million tokens of diverse synthetic data without mixing any real data, is sufficient for effective domain adaptation when using MetaSynth.

Abstract: Labeling has always been expensive in the medical context, which has hindered related deep learning application. Our work introduces active learning in surgical video frame selection to construct a high-quality, affordable Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy dataset for semantic segmentation. Active learning allows the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learning pipeline to include the dataset construction workflow, which means DNNs trained by existing dataset will identify the most informative data from the newly collected data. At the same time, DNNs' performance and generalization ability improve over time when the newly selected and annotated data are included in the training data. We assessed different data informativeness measurements and found the deep features distances select the most informative data in this task. Our experiments show that with half of the data selected by active learning, the DNNs achieve almost the same performance with 0.4349 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) compared to the same DNNs trained on the full dataset (0.4374 mIoU) on the critical anatomies and surgical instruments.

Abstract: Benchmarks that concisely summarize the performance of many-qubit quantum computers are essential for measuring progress towards the goal of useful quantum computation. In this work, we present a benchmarking framework that is based on quantifying how a quantum computer's performance on quantum circuits varies as a function of features of those circuits, such as circuit depth, width, two-qubit gate density, problem input size, or algorithmic depth. Our featuremetric benchmarking framework generalizes volumetric benchmarking -- a widely-used methodology that quantifies performance versus circuit width and depth -- and we show that it enables richer and more faithful models of quantum computer performance. We demonstrate featuremetric benchmarking with example benchmarks run on IBM Q and IonQ systems of up to 27 qubits, and we show how to produce performance summaries from the data using Gaussian process regression. Our data analysis methods are also of interest in the special case of volumetric benchmarking, as they enable the creation of intuitive two-dimensional capability regions using data from few circuits.

<title>Identifying and Mitigating the Influence of the Prior Distribution in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) sometimes fail to respond appropriately to deterministic tasks -- such as counting or forming acronyms -- because the implicit prior distribution they have learned over sequences of tokens influences their responses. In this work, we show that, in at least some cases, LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly, and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons related to the prior probability of token sequences.

Abstract: Spectral algorithms leverage spectral regularization techniques to analyze and process data, providing a flexible framework for addressing supervised learning problems. To deepen our understanding of their performance in real-world scenarios where the distributions of training and test data may differ, we conduct a rigorous investigation into the convergence behavior of spectral algorithms under distribution shifts, specifically within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our study focuses on the case of covariate shift. In this scenario, the marginal distributions of the input data differ between the training and test datasets, while the conditional distribution of the output given the input remains unchanged. Under this setting, we analyze the generalization error of spectral algorithms and show that they achieve minimax optimality when the density ratios between the training and test distributions are uniformly bounded. However, we also identify a critical limitation: when the density ratios are unbounded, the spectral algorithms may become suboptimal. To address this limitation, we propose a weighted spectral algorithm that incorporates density ratio information into the learning process. Our theoretical analysis shows that this weighted approach achieves optimal capacity-independent convergence rates. Furthermore, by introducing a weight clipping technique, we demonstrate that the convergence rates of the weighted spectral algorithm can approach the optimal capacity-dependent convergence rates arbitrarily closely. This improvement resolves the suboptimality issue in unbounded density ratio scenarios and advances the state-of-the-art by refining existing theoretical results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.

Abstract: We propose a clustering method, funWeightClustSkew, based on mixtures of functional linear regression models and three skewed multivariate distributions: the variance-gamma distribution, the skew-t distribution, and the normal-inverse Gaussian distribution. Our approach follows the framework of the functional high dimensional data clustering (funHDDC) method, and we extend to functional data the cluster weighted models based on skewed distributions used for finite dimensional multivariate data. We consider several parsimonious models, and to estimate the parameters we construct an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We illustrate the performance of funWeightClustSkew for simulated data and for the Air Quality dataset.

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs), generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of forgetting, critical for generalization.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC), the ability to adapt to a new partner in a cooperative task, is a critical component of human-compatible AI. While prior work has focused on training agents to cooperate on a single task, these specialized models do not generalize to new tasks, even if they are highly similar. Here, we study how reinforcement learning on a distribution of environments with a single partner enables learning general cooperative skills that support ZSC with many new partners on many new problems. We introduce two Jax-based, procedural generators that create billions of solvable coordination challenges. We develop a new paradigm called Cross-Environment Cooperation (CEC), and show that it outperforms competitive baselines quantitatively and qualitatively when collaborating with real people. Our findings suggest that learning to collaborate across many unique scenarios encourages agents to develop general norms, which prove effective for collaboration with different partners. Together, our results suggest a new route toward designing generalist cooperative agents capable of interacting with humans without requiring human data.

<title>Post-pre-training for Modality Alignment in Vision-Language Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, the multi-modal feature spaces still suffer from a modality gap, which is a gap between image and text feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or fine-tuning, they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine, a post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To this end, we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features. Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the zero-shot performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that an eXtremely Large (XL) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) wireless system with appropriate analog combining components exhibits the properties of a universal function approximator, similar to a feedforward neural network. By treating the XL MIMO channel coefficients as the random nodes of a hidden layer, and the receiver's analog combiner as a trainable output layer, we cast the end-to-end system to the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) framework, leading to a novel formulation for Over-The-Air (OTA) edge inference without requiring traditional digital processing nor pre-processing at the transmitter. Through theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation, we showcase that XL-MIMO-ELM enables near-instantaneous training and efficient classification, suggesting the paradigm shift of beyond massive MIMO systems as neural networks alongside their profound communications role. Compared to deep learning approaches and conventional ELMs, the proposed framework achieves on par performance with orders of magnitude lower complexity, making it highly attractive for ultra low power wireless devices.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical deployment of text-to-image models requires effective techniques to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content. While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to training specialized instruction-based image-editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in structural preservation with input images and semantic alignment with user prompts. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their utility as proxies for real-world settings.

Abstract: Large pretrained vision foundation models have shown significant potential in various vision tasks. However, for industrial anomaly detection, the scarcity of real defect samples poses a critical challenge in leveraging these models. While 2D anomaly generation has significantly advanced with established generative models, the adoption of 3D sensors in industrial manufacturing has made leveraging 3D data for surface quality inspection an emerging trend. In contrast to 2D techniques, 3D anomaly generation remains largely unexplored, limiting the potential of 3D data in industrial quality inspection. To address this gap, we propose a novel yet simple 3D anomaly generation method, 3D-PNAS, based on Perlin noise and surface parameterization. Our method generates realistic 3D surface anomalies by projecting the point cloud onto a 2D plane, sampling multi-scale noise values from a Perlin noise field, and perturbing the point cloud along its normal direction. Through comprehensive visualization experiments, we demonstrate how key parameters - including noise scale, perturbation strength, and octaves, provide fine-grained control over the generated anomalies, enabling the creation of diverse defect patterns from pronounced deformations to subtle surface variations. Additionally, our cross-category experiments show that the method produces consistent yet geometrically plausible anomalies across different object types, adapting to their specific surface characteristics. We also provide a comprehensive codebase and visualization toolkit to facilitate future research.

Abstract: We study the effectiveness of randomizing split-directions in random forests. Prior literature has shown that, on the one hand, randomization can reduce variance through decorrelation, and, on the other hand, randomization regularizes and works in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. First, we bring together and revisit decorrelation and regularization by presenting a systematic analysis of out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) for different SNR scenarios based on commonly-used data-generating processes. We find that variance reduction tends to increase with the SNR and forests outperform bagging when the SNR is low because, in low SNR cases, variance dominates bias for both methods. Second, we show that the effectiveness of randomization is a question that goes beyond the SNR. We present a simulation study with fixed and moderate SNR, in which we examine the effectiveness of randomization for other data characteristics. In particular, we find that (i) randomization can increase bias in the presence of fat tails in the distribution of covariates; (ii) in the presence of irrelevant covariates randomization is ineffective because bias dominates variance; and (iii) when covariates are mutually correlated randomization tends to be effective because variance dominates bias. Beyond randomization, we find that, for both bagging and random forests, bias can be significantly reduced in the presence of correlated covariates. This last finding goes beyond the prevailing view that averaging mostly works by variance reduction. Given that in practice covariates are often correlated, our findings on correlated covariates could open the way for a better understanding of why random forests work well in many applications.

Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability is concerned with analyzing individual components in a (convolutional) neural network (CNN) and how they form larger circuits representing decision mechanisms. These investigations are challenging since CNNs frequently learn polysemantic channels that encode distinct concepts, making them hard to interpret. To address this, we propose an algorithm to disentangle a specific kind of polysemantic channel into multiple channels, each responding to a single concept. Our approach restructures weights in a CNN, utilizing that different concepts within the same channel exhibit distinct activation patterns in the previous layer. By disentangling these polysemantic features, we enhance the interpretability of CNNs, ultimately improving explanatory techniques such as feature visualizations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the development of general-purpose autonomous agents, demonstrating remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks across various domains. This surge has spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs. By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results. So, are retrials all you need?

Abstract: Domain generalization aims at training on source domains to uncover a domain-invariant feature space, allowing the model to perform robust generalization ability on unknown target domains. However, due to domain gaps, it is hard to find reliable common image feature space, and the reason for that is the lack of suitable basic units for images. Different from image in vision space, language has comprehensive expression elements that can effectively convey semantics. Inspired by the semantic completeness of language and intuitiveness of image, we propose VLCA, which combine language space and vision space, and connect the multiple image domains by using semantic space as the bridge domain. Specifically, in language space, by taking advantage of the completeness of language basic units, we tend to capture the semantic representation of the relations between categories through word vector distance. Then, in vision space, by taking advantage of the intuitiveness of image features, the common pattern of sample features with the same class is explored through low-rank approximation. In the end, the language representation is aligned with the vision representation through the multimodal space of text and image. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Quantum channel discrimination has been studied from an information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of unknown channel accesses. In this paper, we study the query complexity of quantum channel discrimination, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of channel uses needed to reach a desired error probability. To this end, we show that the query complexity of binary channel discrimination depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the (geometric and Holevo) channel fidelity. As a special case of these findings, we precisely characterize the query complexity of discriminating between two classical channels. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the query complexity of binary asymmetric channel discrimination and multiple quantum channel discrimination. For the former, the query complexity depends on the geometric R\'enyi and Petz R\'enyi channel divergences, while for the latter, it depends on the negative logarithm of (geometric and Uhlmann) channel fidelity. For multiple channel discrimination, the upper bound scales as the logarithm of the number of channels.

Abstract: We propose a new theory for aging based on dynamical systems and provide a data-driven computational method to quantify the changes at the cellular level. We use ergodic theory to decompose the dynamics of changes during aging and show that aging is fundamentally a dissipative process within biological systems, akin to dynamical systems where dissipation occurs due to non-conservative forces. To quantify the dissipation dynamics, we employ a transformer-based machine learning algorithm to analyze gene expression data, incorporating age as a token to assess how age-related dissipation is reflected in the embedding space. By evaluating the dynamics of gene and age embeddings, we provide a cellular aging map (CAM) and identify patterns indicative of divergence in gene embedding space, nonlinear transitions, and entropy variations during aging for various tissues and cell types. Our results provide a novel perspective on aging as a dissipative process and introduce a computational framework that enables measuring age-related changes with molecular resolution.

<title>ArtistAuditor: Auditing Artist Style Pirate in Text-to-Image Generation Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image models based on diffusion processes, such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney, are capable of transforming texts into detailed images and have widespread applications in art and design. As such, amateur users can easily imitate professional-level paintings by collecting an artist's work and fine-tuning the model, leading to concerns about artworks' copyright infringement. To tackle these issues, previous studies either add visually imperceptible perturbation to the artwork to change its underlying styles (perturbation-based methods) or embed post-training detectable watermarks in the artwork (watermark-based methods). However, when the artwork or the model has been published online, i.e., modification to the original artwork or model retraining is not feasible, these strategies might not be viable.
  To this end, we propose a novel method for data-use auditing in the text-to-image generation model. The general idea of ArtistAuditor is to identify if a suspicious model has been finetuned using the artworks of specific artists by analyzing the features related to the style. Concretely, ArtistAuditor employs a style extractor to obtain the multi-granularity style representations and treats artworks as samplings of an artist's style. Then, ArtistAuditor queries a trained discriminator to gain the auditing decisions. The experimental results on six combinations of models and datasets show that ArtistAuditor can achieve high AUC values (> 0.937). By studying ArtistAuditor's transferability and core modules, we provide valuable insights into the practical implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ArtistAuditor in real-world cases by an online platform Scenario. ArtistAuditor is open-sourced at https://github.com/Jozenn/ArtistAuditor.

Abstract: We study the approximation gap between the dynamics of a polynomial-width neural network and its infinite-width counterpart, both trained using projected gradient descent in the mean-field scaling regime. We demonstrate how to tightly bound this approximation gap through a differential equation governed by the mean-field dynamics. A key factor influencing the growth of this ODE is the local Hessian of each particle, defined as the derivative of the particle's velocity in the mean-field dynamics with respect to its position. We apply our results to the canonical feature learning problem of estimating a well-specified single-index model; we permit the information exponent to be arbitrarily large, leading to convergence times that grow polynomially in the ambient dimension $d$. We show that, due to a certain ``self-concordance'' property in these problems -- where the local Hessian of a particle is bounded by a constant times the particle's velocity -- polynomially many neurons are sufficient to closely approximate the mean-field dynamics throughout training.

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in video understanding but often suffer from misalignment with human intuition and video hallucination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination. The code and data are available at https://github.com/HaroldChen19/VistaDPO.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of large language models (LLMs) to financial tasks. We fine-tuned foundation models using the Open FinLLM Leaderboard as a benchmark. Building on Qwen2.5 and Deepseek-R1, we employed techniques including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their financial capabilities. The fine-tuned models demonstrated substantial performance gains across a wide range of financial tasks. Moreover, we measured the data scaling law in the financial domain. Our work demonstrates the potential of large language models (LLMs) in financial applications.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to integrating scientific knowledge into generative models, enhancing their realism and consistency in image synthesis. First, we introduce Science-T2I, an expert-annotated adversarial dataset comprising adversarial 20k image pairs with 9k prompts, covering wide distinct scientific knowledge categories. Leveraging Science-T2I, we present SciScore, an end-to-end reward model that refines the assessment of generated images based on scientific knowledge, which is achieved by augmenting both the scientific comprehension and visual capabilities of pre-trained CLIP model. Additionally, based on SciScore, we propose a two-stage training framework, comprising a supervised fine-tuning phase and a masked online fine-tuning phase, to incorporate scientific knowledge into existing generative models. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in establishing new standards for evaluating the scientific realism of generated content. Specifically, SciScore attains performance comparable to human-level, demonstrating a 5% improvement similar to evaluations conducted by experienced human evaluators. Furthermore, by applying our proposed fine-tuning method to FLUX, we achieve a performance enhancement exceeding 50% on SciScore.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, they often struggle with capturing complex human preferences and generalizing to unseen data. To address these challenges, we introduce Energy-Based Reward Model (EBRM), a lightweight post-hoc refinement framework that enhances RM robustness and generalization. EBRM models the reward distribution explicitly, capturing uncertainty in human preferences and mitigating the impact of noisy or misaligned annotations. It achieves this through conflict-aware data filtering, label-noise-aware contrastive training, and hybrid initialization. Notably, EBRM enhances RMs without retraining, making it computationally efficient and adaptable across different models and tasks. Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.

Abstract: A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting distribution -- which can differ substantially from the LM's base distribution -- is generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains -- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger, as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model probabilistic programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a broad variety of controlled generation problems.

Abstract: Vision-language models are integral to computer vision research, yet many high-performing models remain closed-source, obscuring their data, design and training recipe. The research community has responded by using distillation from black-box models to label training data, achieving strong benchmark results, at the cost of measurable scientific progress. However, without knowing the details of the teacher model and its data sources, scientific progress remains difficult to measure. In this paper, we study building a Perception Language Model (PLM) in a fully open and reproducible framework for transparent research in image and video understanding. We analyze standard training pipelines without distillation from proprietary models and explore large-scale synthetic data to identify critical data gaps, particularly in detailed video understanding. To bridge these gaps, we release 2.8M human-labeled instances of fine-grained video question-answer pairs and spatio-temporally grounded video captions. Additionally, we introduce PLM-VideoBench, a suite for evaluating challenging video understanding tasks focusing on the ability to reason about "what", "where", "when", and "how" of a video. We make our work fully reproducible by providing data, training recipes, code & models.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often exploit *spurious* features that are present in the majority of examples within a class during training. This leads to *poor worst-group test accuracy*, i.e., poor accuracy for minority groups that lack these spurious features. Despite the growing body of recent efforts to address spurious correlations (SC), several challenging settings remain unexplored.In this work, we propose studying methods to mitigate SC in settings with: 1) spurious features that are learned more slowly, 2) a larger number of classes, and 3) a larger number of groups. We introduce two new datasets, Animals and SUN, to facilitate this study and conduct a systematic benchmarking of 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across a total of 5 vision datasets, training over 5,000 models. Through this, we highlight how existing group inference methods struggle in the presence of spurious features that are learned later in training. Additionally, we demonstrate how all existing methods struggle in settings with more groups and/or classes. Finally, we show the importance of careful model selection (hyperparameter tuning) in extracting optimal performance, especially in the more challenging settings we introduced, and propose more cost-efficient strategies for model selection. Overall, through extensive and systematic experiments, this work uncovers a suite of new challenges and opportunities for improving worst-group generalization in the presence of spurious features.

Abstract: We introduce the asynchronous graph generator (AGG), a novel graph attention network for imputation and prediction of multi-channel time series. Free from recurrent components or assumptions about temporal/spatial regularity, AGG encodes measurements, timestamps and channel-specific features directly in the nodes via learnable embeddings. Through an attention mechanism, these embeddings allow for discovering expressive relationships among the variables of interest in the form of a homogeneous graph. Once trained, AGG performs imputation by \emph{conditional attention generation}, i.e., by creating a new node conditioned on given timestamps and channel specification. The proposed AGG is compared to related methods in the literature and its performance is analysed from a data augmentation perspective. Our experiments reveal that AGG achieved state-of-the-art results in time series imputation, classification and prediction for the benchmark datasets \emph{Beijing Air Quality}, \emph{PhysioNet ICU 2012} and \emph{UCI localisation}, outperforming other recent attention-based networks.

Abstract: Non-conjugate Gaussian processes (NCGPs) define a flexible probabilistic framework to model categorical, ordinal and continuous data, and are widely used in practice. However, exact inference in NCGPs is prohibitively expensive for large datasets, thus requiring approximations in practice. The approximation error adversely impacts the reliability of the model and is not accounted for in the uncertainty of the prediction. We introduce a family of iterative methods that explicitly model this error. They are uniquely suited to parallel modern computing hardware, efficiently recycle computations, and compress information to reduce both the time and memory requirements for NCGPs. As we demonstrate on large-scale classification problems, our method significantly accelerates posterior inference compared to competitive baselines by trading off reduced computation for increased uncertainty.

Abstract: Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose PraX, a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate PraX on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.

Abstract: In data science, hypergraphs are natural models for data exhibiting multi-way relations, whereas graphs only capture pairwise. Nonetheless, many proposed hypergraph neural networks effectively reduce hypergraphs to undirected graphs via symmetrized matrix representations, potentially losing important information. We propose an alternative approach to hypergraph neural networks in which the hypergraph is represented as a non-reversible Markov chain. We use this Markov chain to construct a complex Hermitian Laplacian matrix - the magnetic Laplacian - which serves as the input to our proposed hypergraph neural network. We study HyperMagNet for the task of node classification, and demonstrate its effectiveness over graph-reduction based hypergraph neural networks.

Abstract: Diffusion models represent a powerful family of generative models widely used for image and video generation. However, the time-consuming deployment, long inference time, and requirements on large memory hinder their applications on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we propose a method based on the improved Straight-Through Estimator to improve the deployment efficiency of diffusion models. Specifically, we add sparse masks to the Convolution and Linear layers in a pre-trained diffusion model, then transfer learn the sparse model during the fine-tuning stage and turn on the sparse masks during inference. Experimental results on a Transformer and UNet-based diffusion models demonstrate that our method reduces MACs by 50% while maintaining FID. Sparse models are accelerated by approximately 1.2x on the GPU. Under other MACs conditions, the FID is also lower than 1 compared to other methods.

Abstract: To perform effective causal inference in high-dimensional datasets, initiating the process with causal discovery is imperative, wherein a causal graph is generated based on observational data. However, obtaining a complete and accurate causal graph poses a formidable challenge, recognized as an NP- hard problem. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era, indicating their emergent capabilities and widespread applicability in facilitating causal reasoning across diverse domains, such as medicine, finance, and science. The expansive knowledge base of LLMs holds the potential to elevate the field of causal reasoning by offering interpretability, making inferences, generalizability, and uncovering novel causal structures. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, named Autonomous LLM-Augmented Causal Discovery Framework (ALCM), to synergize data-driven causal discovery algorithms and LLMs, automating the generation of a more resilient, accurate, and explicable causal graph. The ALCM consists of three integral components: causal structure learning, causal wrapper, and LLM-driven causal refiner. These components autonomously collaborate within a dynamic environment to address causal discovery questions and deliver plausible causal graphs. We evaluate the ALCM framework by implementing two demonstrations on seven well-known datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ALCM outperforms existing LLM methods and conventional data-driven causal reasoning mechanisms. This study not only shows the effectiveness of the ALCM but also underscores new research directions in leveraging the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Sleep is vital for people's physical and mental health, and sound sleep can help them focus on daily activities. Therefore, a sleep study that includes sleep patterns and sleep disorders is crucial to enhancing our knowledge about individuals' health status. This study aims to provide a comprehensive, systematic review of the recent literature to analyze the different approaches and their outcomes in sleep studies, which includes works on "sleep stages classification" and "sleep disorder detection" using AI. In this review, 183 articles were initially selected from different journals, among which 80 records were enlisted for explicit review, ranging from 2016 to 2023. Brain waves were the most commonly employed body parameters for sleep staging and disorder studies (almost 29% of the research used brain activity signals exclusively, and 77% combined with the other signals). The convolutional neural network (CNN), the most widely used of the 34 distinct artificial intelligence models, comprised 27%. The other models included the long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and recurrent neural network (RNN), which consisted of 11%, 6%, 6%, and 5% sequentially. For performance metrics, accuracy was widely used for a maximum of 83.75% of the cases, the F1 score of 45%, Kappa of 36.25%, Sensitivity of 31.25%, and Specificity of 30% of cases, along with the other metrics. This article would help physicians and researchers get the gist of AI's contribution to sleep studies and the feasibility of their intended work.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model. This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates, we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.

Abstract: Multi-modal methods establish comprehensive superiority over uni-modal methods. However, the imbalanced contributions of different modalities to task-dependent predictions constantly degrade the discriminative performance of canonical multi-modal methods. Based on the contribution to task-dependent predictions, modalities can be identified as predominant and auxiliary modalities. Benchmark methods raise a tractable solution: augmenting the auxiliary modality with a minor contribution during training. However, our empirical explorations challenge the fundamental idea behind such behavior, and we further conclude that benchmark approaches suffer from certain defects: insufficient theoretical interpretability and limited exploration capability of discriminative knowledge. To this end, we revisit multi-modal representation learning from a causal perspective and build the Structural Causal Model. Following the empirical explorations, we determine to capture the true causality between the discriminative knowledge of predominant modality and predictive label while considering the auxiliary modality. Thus, we introduce the $\beta$-generalization front-door criterion. Furthermore, we propose a novel network for sufficiently exploring multi-modal discriminative knowledge. Rigorous theoretical analyses and various empirical evaluations are provided to support the effectiveness of the innate mechanism behind our proposed method.

Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced the field of continual learning (CL), enabling positive knowledge transfer and resilience to catastrophic forgetting. To sustain these advantages for sequentially arriving tasks, a promising direction involves keeping the pre-trained backbone frozen while employing parameter-efficient tuning (PET) techniques to instruct representation learning. Despite the popularity of Prompt-based PET for CL, its empirical design often leads to sub-optimal performance in our evaluation of different PTMs and target tasks. To this end, we propose a unified framework for CL with PTMs and PET that provides both theoretical and empirical advancements. We first perform an in-depth theoretical analysis of the CL objective in a pre-training context, decomposing it into hierarchical components namely within-task prediction, task-identity inference and task-adaptive prediction. We then present Hierarchical Decomposition PET (HiDe-PET), an innovative approach that explicitly optimizes the decomposed objective through incorporating task-specific and task-shared knowledge via mainstream PET techniques along with efficient recovery of pre-trained representations. Leveraging this framework, we delve into the distinct impacts of implementation strategy, PET technique and PET architecture, as well as adaptive knowledge accumulation amidst pronounced distribution changes. Finally, across various CL scenarios, our approach demonstrates remarkably superior performance over a broad spectrum of recent strong baselines.

Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.

Abstract: On-device inference holds great potential for increased energy efficiency, responsiveness, and privacy in edge ML systems. However, due to less capable ML models that can be embedded in resource-limited devices, use cases are limited to simple inference tasks such as visual keyword spotting, gesture recognition, and predictive analytics. In this context, the Hierarchical Inference (HI) system has emerged as a promising solution that augments the capabilities of the local ML by offloading selected samples to an edge server or cloud for remote ML inference. Existing works demonstrate through simulation that HI improves accuracy. However, they do not account for the latency and energy consumption on the device, nor do they consider three key heterogeneous dimensions that characterize ML systems: hardware, network connectivity, and models. In contrast, this paper systematically compares the performance of HI with on-device inference based on measurements of accuracy, latency, and energy for running embedded ML models on five devices with different capabilities and three image classification datasets. For a given accuracy requirement, the HI systems we designed achieved up to 73% lower latency and up to 77% lower device energy consumption than an on-device inference system. The key to building an efficient HI system is the availability of small-size, reasonably accurate on-device models whose outputs can be effectively differentiated for samples that require remote inference. Despite the performance gains, HI requires on-device inference for all samples, which adds a fixed overhead to its latency and energy consumption. Therefore, we design a hybrid system, Early Exit with HI (EE-HI), and demonstrate that compared to HI, EE-HI reduces the latency by up to 59.7% and lowers the device's energy consumption by up to 60.4%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been applied across various scientific fields, including chemistry. However, many chemical tasks require the processing of visual information, which cannot be successfully handled by existing chemical LLMs. This brings a growing need for models capable of integrating multimodal information in the chemical domain. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{ChemVLM}, an open-source chemical multimodal large language model specifically designed for chemical applications. ChemVLM is trained on a carefully curated bilingual multimodal dataset that enhances its ability to understand both textual and visual chemical information, including molecular structures, reactions, and chemistry examination questions. We develop three datasets for comprehensive evaluation, tailored to Chemical Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Chemical Reasoning (MMCR), and Multimodal Molecule Understanding tasks. We benchmark ChemVLM against a range of open-source and proprietary multimodal large language models on various tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ChemVLM achieves competitive performance across all evaluated tasks. Our model can be found at https://huggingface.co/AI4Chem/ChemVLM-26B.

<title>Control the GNN: Utilizing Neural Controller with Lyapunov Stability for Test-Time Feature Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: The performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) is susceptible to discrepancies between training and testing sample distributions. Prior studies have attempted to mitigating the impact of distribution shift by reconstructing node features during the testing phase without modifying the model parameters. However, these approaches lack theoretical analysis of the proximity between predictions and ground truth at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel node feature reconstruction method grounded in Lyapunov stability theory. Specifically, we model the GNN as a control system during the testing phase, considering node features as control variables. A neural controller that adheres to the Lyapunov stability criterion is then employed to reconstruct these node features, ensuring that the predictions progressively approach the ground truth at test time. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

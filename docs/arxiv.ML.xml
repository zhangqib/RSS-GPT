Summary: 
Self-attention mechanisms are crucial for Transformer architectures' success, but their robustness to noise and spurious correlations is not well understood. This study evaluates different self-attention mechanisms in Vision Transformers under various data corruption scenarios. Testing on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette datasets reveals that Doubly Stochastic attention is the most robust, consistently outperforming other mechanisms by 0.1%-5.1% when data is corrupted during training or testing. These findings provide insights for selecting self-attention mechanisms in settings with imperfect data.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Self-attention mechanisms are foundational to Transformer architectures, supporting their impressive success in a wide range of tasks. While there are many self-attention variants, their robustness to noise and spurious correlations has not been well studied. This study evaluates Softmax, Sigmoid, Linear, Doubly Stochastic, and Cosine attention within Vision Transformers under different data corruption scenarios. Through testing across the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette datasets, we show that Doubly Stochastic attention is the most robust. It consistently outperformed the next best mechanism by $0.1\%-5.1\%$ when training data, or both training and testing data, were corrupted. Our findings inform self-attention selection in contexts with imperfect data. The code used is available at https://github.com/ctamayor/NeurIPS-Robustness-ViT.

<br />
Summary: Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO) is introduced as a framework for learning from preferences in large language models (LLMs). It incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective, extending the existing paradigm of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by using MaP. This approach improves alignment by avoiding oversimplified binary classification of responses. MaPPO does not require additional hyperparameters and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. It can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement over DPO variants. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks show that MaPPO enhances alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency. <div>

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds, Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective. This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

<div> Sequence modeling, State-Space Models, hardware accelerator, EpochCore, systolic arrays, LIMA-PE, ProDF

Summary:
EpochCore is introduced as a hardware accelerator designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long-range sequence tasks. Utilizing systolic arrays (SAs) and a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE, EpochCore achieves significant performance gains and energy efficiency improvements. The proposed dataflow, ProDF, enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. With these innovations, EpochCore demonstrates on average 250x performance gains and 45x energy efficiency improvements compared to traditional SA-based accelerators, with a 2x increase in area cost. Additionally, EpochCore achieves around a 2,000x improvement in latency/inference on Long-Range Autoregressive (LRA) datasets compared to GPU kernel operations. <div>

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations.

<div> path tracing, volume rendering, radiance caching, Monte Carlo integration, photorealistic rendering

Summary:
Our work introduces a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering, addressing the slow rendering performance and high pixel variance challenges. We leverage volumetric scene representation and adapt 3D Gaussian splatting as a path-space radiance cache that dynamically adjusts to scene parameters. This trainable cache enhances image quality without increasing costs. Comparisons with baseline path tracers and neural radiance caching show our approach is robust, easy to integrate, and significantly improves rendering quality in volumetric visualization applications while maintaining efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization, volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering. Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache. This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

<div> mobile users, user-centric clustering, handoff operations, deep reinforcement learning, soft actor-critic

Summary: 
The paper proposes a solution using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to predict and manage connections for mobile users in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO networks. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is utilized with continuous action space representation to train a deep neural network for handoff (HO) policy. A novel reward function is introduced to balance attainable rate and HO overhead. Two variants are developed with either mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations or history-assisted (HA) observations. Simulation results demonstrate the scalability of the continuous action space approach and the ability of the HO policy to minimize overhead by timing HO initiation. The solution achieves a real-time response time of less than 0.4 ms. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces RAVEN, a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system that enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing interference and background noise. Visual embeddings from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker detection (ASD) models play a crucial role in improving AVSE performance in various SNR conditions and multi-speaker settings. Concatenating embeddings from AVSR and ASD models is particularly effective in low-SNR, multi-speaker environments, while AVSR embeddings alone work best in noise-only scenarios. The study also presents a real-time streaming system that operates on a computer CPU and provides a video demonstration along with an open-source code repository. This marks the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE system, offering a valuable resource for researchers and developers in the field. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios. In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE system.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance.

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data cleaning stage.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel Residual Guided Training approach for Physics-Informed Transformer models using Generative Adversarial Networks. This strategy aims to address challenges faced by traditional PINNs in dealing with unresolved residuals and temporal causality violations in nonlinear PDEs.

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

arXiv:2508.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification, environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity, resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns, was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive, Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure mode

arXiv:2508.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas, continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected vehicles and trains.

Summary:
The paper introduces a model-free approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. Traditional methods rely on complex dynamic models, but the proposed GNN-ASE model utilizes raw current and vibration signals as direct inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing. The model automatically learns and extracts relevant features, leveraging the graph structure to capture complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns.

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring and predictive maintenance.

Summary:
- Reproducibility is essential in scientific research to verify and validate findings.
- Machine Learning (ML) faces challenges in reproducibility due to nondeterminism and computational constraints.
- ML applications in building energy systems lack transparency and reproducibility.
- Many articles in this field do not disclose dataset sources or share code links.
- The study emphasizes the need for reproducibility guidelines, training, and policies to promote transparency in research. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non - replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote transparency and reproducibility.

<br />
Foundation models for natural language processing have established definitions and methods for hallucination, but similar frameworks are lacking for multi-variate time-series (MVTS) models. This study introduces new definitions for MVTS hallucination and proposes detection and mitigation methods using a diffusion model. Relational datasets are derived from popular time-series datasets to benchmark hallucination levels in MVTS foundation models. Results show that open-source pre-trained MVTS imputation models exhibit relational hallucination levels averaging 59.5% compared to a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation technique reduces this by up to 47.7%. These new definitions and methods aim to enhance the adoption and safe utilization of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation. However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Summary: 
This article addresses the challenge of dynamic traffic flow forecasting in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. The authors propose a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework that combines global and local patterns to enhance forecasting accuracy. By integrating a graph transformer encoder with a graph convolution unit using a gated fusion approach, the model can capture hidden global temporal-spatial relations and balance the importance of local and global patterns. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines on real-world traffic networks, demonstrating its strong representation capability in capturing complex temporal-spatial dependencies. The model's ability to encode globally temporal-spatial patterns improves robustness in dealing with the complex traffic environment, making it a promising approach for accurate traffic flow forecasting.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various real-world traffic networks.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Graph matching, a common problem in computer science, is typically solved using Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). Existing methods use projection-based relaxations to simplify the problem, but this can lead to errors. A new approach, Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA), reduces these errors by introducing a regularization term. The Scaling Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm efficiently solves FRA, and a mixed-precision architecture further accelerates the process. Benchmark tests showed that FRAM outperforms other methods, and when combined with a GPU-based architecture, it achieves significant speedup without sacrificing accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2508.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However, these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Summary:
- A dynamic and individualised framework using Belgian naturalistic driving data was proposed for identifying risky driving behaviour.
- The approach utilized a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to dynamically calibrate risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing subtle behavioural shifts.
- Three data-driven models, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN), were evaluated on two safety indicators: speed-weighted headway and harsh driving events.
- The DNN showed strong capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly excelling in high-recall tasks.
- XGBoost provided a balanced and stable performance across different thresholds and evaluation metrics, while Random Forest responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments.
- Speed-weighted headway emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh driving events, showing robustness to label sparsity and contextual variation.
- Adaptive, personalised risk detection approaches were deemed valuable for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring driver support in intelligent transport systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour - limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data. The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Summary:
This article explores the challenge of deploying deep learning-based tools for splicing detection due to their sensitivity to training conditions and post-processing effects. The research highlights the variability in detector performance when subjected to unseen post-processing, despite similar accuracy on test data. It attributes this variability to differences in the latent spaces induced by training, affecting sample separation internally. The study identifies a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a detector's generalization to post-processed images. To address this issue, the researchers propose a practical approach of training multiple model variants under diverse conditions and selecting the one that maximizes latent margins. This strategy aims to build more robust detectors capable of withstanding various post-processing challenges. <div>
arXiv:2508.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions, and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Summary:
- The study explores how transformers acquire and extract knowledge in large language models, combining self-attention and MLP modules in a one-layer framework.
- The analysis reveals that transformers can effectively acquire knowledge during pre-training and extract factual knowledge during post-fine-tuning with specific conditions met.
- Successful knowledge extraction is achieved when tested on factual knowledge learned during pre-training but not reinforced during fine-tuning, resulting in low generalization error.
- However, if the conditions for fine-tuning dataset size and data multiplicity are not met, transformers exhibit high generalization loss and may generate incorrect information.
- The study provides theoretical insights into empirical phenomena such as learning rate schedules, supported by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract (retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque. While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer, attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction. We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied, transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate our results.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task, limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover, they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains, hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction, and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives. Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a fully unsupervised manner.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges of token inflation and potential overbilling in commercial large language model (LLM) services, where internal reasoning traces are often hidden from users. In response, the PALACE framework is introduced to estimate hidden reasoning token counts without access to internal traces.

Experimental results across different reasoning benchmarks demonstrate PALACE's accuracy in predicting token counts, enabling fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection.

arXiv:2508.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing, yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g., hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing, offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user trust.

Summary:
CaliMatch introduces a novel method for safe semi-supervised learning by calibrating both the classifier and the out-of-distribution (OOD) detector. The approach addresses the overconfidence issue in deep neural networks that can lead to SSL errors. By utilizing adaptive label smoothing and temperature scaling, CaliMatch eliminates the need for manual tuning and improves the overall calibration of the model. The paper provides a theoretical justification for the importance of calibration in safe SSL tasks. Extensive evaluations on various datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that CaliMatch outperforms existing methods in SSL tasks. This innovative approach enhances the performance of machine learning models when labeled data is limited, making it a valuable contribution to the field of SSL research.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe SSL tasks.

Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming framework is proposed to continuously stress-test large language models (LLMs) in clinical practice for safety and reliability. The framework autonomously mutates test cases and evaluates responses to uncover vulnerabilities in real time across domains like robustness, privacy, bias/fairness, and hallucination. The study found that despite high accuracy rates in static benchmarks, LLMs exhibited high failure rates under adversarial pressure, with privacy leaks, bias impacts, and hallucination issues being prevalent. The findings suggest that current LLMs pose significant risks for patient harm and are unfit for routine clinical practice. The DAS red-teaming approach provides an evolvable, scalable, and reliable safeguard for the implementation of medical AI in healthcare settings, ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of AI applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy, bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies, and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\% in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

<div> Keywords: temporal multimodal data, audiovisual, hybrid hypergraph network, long-range temporal dependencies, complex classification tasks

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework called the hybrid hypergraph network (HHN) for modeling temporal multimodal data, particularly focusing on audiovisual data. The framework adopts a segmentation-first, graph-later strategy, splitting sequences into timestamped segments represented as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured using hyperedges based on a maximum entropy difference criterion, enabling the extraction of high-order dependencies through hypergraph convolution. Inter-modal links are established through temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. The HHN framework has shown state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in handling complex classification tasks. <div>

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces an adaptive version of the LOCO metric to assess cooperative effects in feature importance in XAI. It assigns unique, redundant, and synergistic scores to individual data patterns, offering a deeper understanding of feature relevance. A comparison with the Shapley effect is also presented. The study focuses on the association between air pollutants and Alzheimer's disease mortality rate in a One-Health context. Results show synergistic relationships between O3 and NO2 features with mortality, particularly in Bergamo and Brescia provinces. Additionally, urban green areas' density synergistically influences pollutant-related mortality predictions. This framework demonstrates the potential of local Hi-Fi in analyzing high-order relationships in complex systems, bringing new perspectives to XAI applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems. Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores (unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named {\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality, especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

<div> Keywords: Sea surface temperature prediction, Ocean Knowledge Graph, Large language models, Graph embedding network, Numerical data fusion

Summary: <br /><br />Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is crucial for various applications in ocean science, but current data-driven methods often do not utilize domain knowledge effectively. A new framework called Ocean Knowledge Graph-enhanced Large Language Model (OKG-LLM) is introduced to improve global SST prediction. The framework includes constructing an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) to represent diverse ocean knowledge and a graph embedding network to learn this knowledge. By integrating the learned knowledge with numerical SST data and utilizing a pre-trained Large Language Model, OKG-LLM outperforms existing methods in accuracy and effectiveness. This innovative approach has the potential to advance SST prediction and improve outcomes in weather forecasting, fisheries management, and storm tracking. <div>

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science, supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online repository.

Summary: 
FeatureCuts is a novel feature selection algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal feature cutoff following filter ranking. It outperformed existing methods by achieving 15 percentage points higher feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while maintaining model accuracy across multiple datasets. When combined with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), FeatureCuts enabled 25 percentage points more feature reduction, reduced computation time by 66%, and preserved model performance compared to using PSO alone. The scalability of FeatureCuts for large datasets commonly found in enterprise settings makes it a practical solution for data analysis tasks. <div>

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction, requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

<div> Generative Multimodal Large Language Models, Efficient Framework, Hierarchical Embedding Prompt Template, Self-Aware Hard Negative Sampling, Universal Embedding Tasks <br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of adapting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for discriminative representation learning. The proposed framework focuses on a hierarchical embedding prompt template with a two-level instruction architecture to produce discriminative representations. Additionally, self-aware hard negative sampling is introduced to improve the fine-tuning process by mining challenging negatives efficiently and filtering out false negatives using the model's own understanding. Experimental results show that the hierarchical prompt achieves competitive zero-shot performance compared to contrastively trained baselines and enhances fine-tuning by improving performance on the MMEB benchmark. The implementation of self-aware hard negative sampling further boosts performance, achieving state-of-the-art results without the need for contrastive pre-training. The approach offers an effective and efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly reducing training time. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8 points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly reducing training time.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers introduced U^2QT, a framework for multi-source user representation learning that addresses limitations of late-fusion strategies. This framework integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. It consists of a causal Q-Former for projecting domain-specific features into a shared causal representation space and a multi-view RQ-VAE for discretizing causal embeddings into compact tokens. Experimental results show U^2QT outperforms task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation.

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks, scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports industrial-scale applications.

<div> Keywords: zero-shot text classification, large language models, contrastive prompting, active learning, semantic reasoning

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework for zero-shot text classification in evolving domains like ticketing systems. The framework combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and active learning to improve generalization in large language models. Initial topic labels are generated from a small set of labeled samples, and a contrastive prompting process refines category definitions by teaching the model to differentiate between closely related classes. A human-in-the-loop component allows users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language, enabling seamless integration of new categories without retraining. Evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia datasets show strong performance, with 91% accuracy on AGNews and 84% on DBpedia for seen and unseen classes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining, making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%, respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

<div> Keywords: Physically Guided Neural Networks, Internal Variables, Scalability, Reduced-Order Modeling, Transfer Learning

Summary:
Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables (PGNNIV) utilize observable data to uncover internal state relations and incorporate physical knowledge through model architecture and loss regularization. However, when applied to high-dimensional data, scalability becomes a challenge. This work proposes enhancements to PGNNIV by incorporating reduced-order modeling techniques such as spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings in surrogate decoders. These techniques offer trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, improving scalability drastically. Model reuse strategies via transfer learning and fine-tuning allow for efficient adaptation to new materials or configurations, reducing training time while maintaining or enhancing model performance. Illustrative results on a nonlinear diffusion equation case show that the enhanced PGNNIV framework can identify underlying state equations accurately, enhance robustness to noise, mitigate overfitting, and reduce computational demands. These techniques provide scalable solutions for various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and modeling objectives. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables. Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands. The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Summary: 
This paper introduces phantom parallelism as a strategy to improve energy efficiency in training and inferencing with large neural network models. Phantom parallelism aims to reduce the energy consumption of traditional tensor parallelism, which is known to be energy-inefficient. The study focuses on feed-forward network architectures and presents new forward and backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism. These operators are implemented in a custom autograd system within an end-to-end phantom parallel training pipeline. Formal analyses predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts, which are supported by empirical results on up to 256 GPUs. Experiments show a significant reduction of about 50% in energy consumption compared to conventional tensor parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach can train smaller phantom models on fewer GPUs to achieve similar results as larger tensor parallel models on more GPUs, offering the potential for even greater energy savings.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy, called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive, proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater energy savings.

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs) can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph (FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

<div> deep learning, multimodal, biomedical signal classification, domain fusion, ECG

Summary:
The study introduces a new approach to multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, analyzing the impact of complementary feature domains on model performance. It demonstrates that not all fusion of modalities leads to improved accuracy, with diminishing returns possible. Five deep learning models were evaluated, with Hybrid 1 consistently outperforming the baseline in ECG classification, highlighting the synergistic complementarity of time and time-frequency domains. However, the inclusion of the frequency domain in Hybrid 2 did not provide further improvement, suggesting representational redundancy. The research suggests that optimal domain fusion is about the quality of complementarity rather than the number of modalities, introducing a mathematically quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations. This paradigm shift in multimodal ECG deep learning emphasizes intrinsic information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains for optimal performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal (Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains. Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study. This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Summary: 
The article introduces VAULT, an automated adversarial RAG pipeline designed to identify and address weaknesses in natural language inference (NLI) models. It consists of three stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. VAULT uses balanced few-shot retrieval with semantic and lexical similarity embeddings to find relevant contexts. These contexts are then used to generate adversarial hypotheses that are validated by an ensemble of language models. The validated adversarial examples are then integrated back into the training set to improve a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model. VAULT's performance on standard benchmarks demonstrates significant accuracy improvements on SNLI, ANLI, and MultiNLI datasets. It outperforms prior adversarial methods across datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing the robustness of NLI models. By automating the process of generating high-quality adversarial data, VAULT enables rapid and human-independent enhancements in NLI inference tasks.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic (BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from 75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%. It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to 2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI inference tasks.

<div> transformer-based pre-training, histopathology, multi-omics data, pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS

Summary: 
The article introduces MORPHEUS, a transformer-based pre-training framework that integrates histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. By using a masked modeling objective on randomly selected omics portions, MORPHEUS learns biologically meaningful cross-modal relationships. It can work with histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables any-to-any omics generation, allowing inference of omics profiles from any subset of modalities, including histopathology alone. Pre-trained on a large pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS outperforms existing methods across diverse modality combinations and tasks, making it a promising tool for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology. The code for MORPHEUS is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/MORPHEUS.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS, a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core, MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities, seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred from any subset of modalities, including H&amp;E alone. Pre-trained on a large pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

<div> keywords: Large Language Model, LLM inference systems, Resource-Aware Dynamic scheduler, Service Level Objectives, Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenge of efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems, focusing on the unique two-phase computation structure they employ. They introduce two key design principles - optimal tiling and dynamic resource allocation - crucial for achieving high throughput. The Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD) scheduler is proposed, ensuring throughput optimality. Additionally, the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler is designed to meet practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) by prioritizing decode requests close to their Time Between Token (TBT) deadlines and reordering prefill requests based on prompt lengths. Evaluating SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU shows significant improvements over existing methods, with a 53% reduction in median Time To First Token (TTFT) and a 26% increase in maximum serving capacity while meeting latency constraints. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput. Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD) scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

Summary: 
The article introduces van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs) for hierarchical data representation in p-adic space. The neurons in v-PuNNs are characteristic functions of p-adic balls, ensuring exact subtree semantics. The Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning principle is used to represent trees with a depth-K v-PuNN. The Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO) approach with HiPaN-DS and Adam-VAPO achieves state-of-the-art results on WordNet nouns, GO molecular-function, and NCBI Mammalia benchmarks. The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric and exhibits fractal properties. Structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN) are derived from v-PuNNs, bridging number theory with deep learning for efficient and interpretable hierarchical data modeling. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs), the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art: WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho = -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for hierarchical data.

Summary: 
This study investigates multi-fidelity optimization using Gaussian Process (GP) models and a proximity-based acquisition strategy. The approach simplifies fidelity selection by incorporating information from different fidelity levels into a single acquisition function. By combining multi-fidelity GPs with Upper Confidence Bound strategies, the study aims to improve optimization performance in complex design spaces. Various multi-fidelity acquisition strategies, including fidelity-weighted approaches, are benchmarked in representative optimization tasks, such as chemical kinetic models for ammonia production. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proximity-based acquisition function in controlling high-fidelity evaluations while maintaining convergence efficiency. This approach shows potential for minimizing reliance on expensive high-fidelity evaluations and enhancing optimization outcomes in multi-fidelity scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2508.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive) high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process (GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies (including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Summary: 
The article discusses the state-of-the-art in explaining predictions made by graph neural networks (GNNs). It highlights the need for a careful theoretical analysis of various explanation methods due to mixed results across different methods and complexities in GNN architectures. The study focuses on two types of explanations: input-level and layerwise explanations. The research establishes theoretical connections between popular perturbation-based and gradient-based methods, as well as other recent techniques. It demonstrates conditions where GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on edge gradients and reveals that edge gradients are equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. The theoretical findings are validated through experiments on synthetic and real datasets. <div>

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

<div> sampling error, policy gradient, multi-agent reinforcement learning, joint distribution, action selection 

Summary: <br /><br />Independent policy gradient algorithms in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can lead to suboptimal convergence even when all agents' policy gradients point towards an optimal solution. This suboptimal convergence is attributed to sampling error caused by stochastic action selection deviating from the expected joint on-policy distribution. A new method, Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), addresses this issue by introducing adaptive action sampling using a centralized behavior policy. MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more effectively than standard on-policy sampling and improves the reliability of independent policy gradient algorithms by increasing the likelihood of convergence to an optimal joint policy. The empirical evaluation in various multi-agent games validates the efficacy of MA-PROPS in enhancing learning performance in MARL scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2508.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games, but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution. This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method, Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Summary: 
The article introduces FGBench, a dataset designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in chemistry tasks by incorporating fine-grained functional group (FG) information. This dataset comprises 625K molecular property reasoning problems with precisely annotated functional groups localized within the molecule. It includes regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning. The benchmark results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, emphasizing the need to improve their reasoning capabilities for chemistry tasks. The methodology used to construct datasets with functional group-level information in FGBench is expected to be a fundamental framework for generating new question-answer pairs and enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The FGBench dataset and evaluation code are available on GitHub for further research and development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at \href{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}{https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench}.

Summary:
In this study, a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting is introduced to estimate possible future states as a distribution over outcomes, addressing challenges in learning dynamical systems with missing variables and noisy data. Stochastic machine learning techniques enable modeling of ill-posed problems, where a single input may yield multiple correct outputs. The proposed generative machine learning approach perturbs complex high-dimensional dynamical system states physically and logically, beyond typical Gaussian perturbations. Mathematical foundations are established, and the method's effectiveness is demonstrated on challenging systems, including a high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset modeling global weather at a 5.625° meridional resolution. <div>
arXiv:2508.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study, we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset, which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions, where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance. Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological, academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Summary: 
The study introduces Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that hierarchically segments users based on their product-specific engagement behaviors and categorical attributes. The BUS tree construction maximizes the representativeness of marginal users using NDCG as the objective function. It aggregates user behavioral patterns for each tree node, enabling the extraction of popular social content. Connection-based segments are derived from the social graph to improve fairness and mitigate bias in recommendations. Offline analysis demonstrates that BUS-based retrieval outperforms traditional user cohort-based methods in ranking quality. The deployment of this framework in production traffic serving billions of users daily shows significant improvements in online product metrics, such as music ranking and email notifications. This study is the first to integrate diverse user attributes into a tree-based recommendation system at a large industrial scale, with a focus on real-world interpretability. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Summary:

Transformers are explored as potential tools for generating high-quality pseudo-random numbers for optimization in large language models. Theoretical analysis shows that decoder-only Transformer models can simulate known PRNGs like the Linear Congruential Generator and Mersenne Twister.

Experimental validation confirms the ability of Transformer-based PRNGs to generate random numbers that pass statistical tests, showing clear randomness. Furthermore, the models are evaluated for their capability in prediction attacks. Overall, this study highlights the potential benefits of utilizing transformers for PRNG tasks, offering a new perspective on leveraging transformer architectures for efficient and effective generation of pseudo-random numbers in complex language modeling applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction attacks.

<div> Model merging, multi-task learning, vulnerabilities, task vector norms, low confidence<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Model merging is a popular approach for multi-task learning, but current methods may not perform well in more realistic settings. This study identifies two key factors that can negatively impact model merging: disparities in task vector norms and low source model confidence. To address these issues, a new method called DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector Conditioning) is proposed. DisTaC uses knowledge distillation to adjust task vectors and increase source model confidence while preserving task-specific knowledge. Experiments show that by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art model merging techniques can successfully integrate models with harmful traits, leading to significant performance improvements. <div>

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years. However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1) disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits -- where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

<div> tokenized skill scaling, lifelong imitation learning, catastrophic forgetting, new skill scaling, knowledge transfer

Summary:
Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S) is a unified framework that addresses the challenges of lifelong imitation learning by tokenizing model parameters and enabling cross-attention between input and learnable tokens. This approach effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting, achieving an average NBT of 1.0% across tasks. T2S excels in new skill scaling with minimal increases in trainable parameters, requiring only 8.0% trainable tokens in lifelong tasks. Additionally, language-guided skill scaling facilitates efficient knowledge transfer between tasks, with an average FWT of 77.7% across task suites. The framework offers a promising solution for lifelong imitation learning by balancing the retention of previous skills and the acquisition of new ones.

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation learning.

Summary:
MARS is a novel RL framework for automated portfolio management that addresses the challenge of balancing risk and return in dynamically changing market conditions. It employs a multi-agent approach with unique risk profiles enforced by a Safety-Critic network and risk-tolerance thresholds. A Meta-Adaptive Controller dynamically orchestrates the agents to lower portfolio volatility during downturns and seek higher returns in bull markets. By leveraging behavioral diversity, MARS generates a disciplined and adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations without explicit market-feature engineering. Experimental results on major stock indexes show the framework's efficacy in reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold, allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble. By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis, demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria, significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns.

<div> risk-seeking policy optimization, large language model, reinforcement learning, Pass@k, Max@k

Summary: 
The paper introduces Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization (RSPO) as a method to improve the performance of large language models by targeting risk-seeking metrics like Pass@k and Max@k during training. Unlike current models that optimize risk-neutral objectives, RSPO directly optimizes for these metrics, addressing the problem of inefficient optimization caused by the "hitchhiking" phenomenon. By leveraging the closed-form probability of a response being the maximum among multiple samplings, RSPO produces efficient and unbiased gradient estimators for both Pass@k and Max@k. The approach is supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of language models. <div>
arXiv:2508.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the "hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations, resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity, designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability. The Repulsive Reparameterization innovation prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. By using PLU neurons, a minimal MLP with only two neurons can solve the spiral classification task, showing a paradigm shift towards powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers in neural networks. This approach achieves exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself. <div>

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health, prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced, open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery. The platform is accessible at https://www.baishenglai.net.

<title>Oldie but Goodie: Re-illuminating Label Propagation on Graphs with Partially Observed Features</title>

arXiv:2508.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed. In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation (Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention. Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i) multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities. Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization design in communicating uncertainties.

<title>Soft Separation and Distillation: Toward Global Uniformity in Federated Unsupervised Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space. However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local) uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global) uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions. This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby improving global uniformity while preserving local representation expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as an effective solution to this challenge. Project page: https://ssd-uniformity.github.io/

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments. Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1) Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data; and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2). Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability differences and educational context differences between different groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy, preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly; the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server, containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under three CD models.

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static, costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model (GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset, METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data analysis in weak supervision.

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning. Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV) enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples, generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates (ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV, with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288, ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex, as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives, will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$ better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS). Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model. These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

<title>Quenched large deviations for Monte Carlo integration with Coulomb gases</title>

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure $\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure, so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$. Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the \emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to $\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of the approximation of the potential.

<title>Effects of Feature Correlations on Associative Memory Capacity</title>

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space. Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM, and might inspire more data-centric methods.

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised, domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio (VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks, using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore, incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S. digital assets market.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data, including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series. Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks. However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context, which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL framework to further enhance performance.

<title>Training Dynamics of the Cooldown Stage in Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rate Scheduler</title>

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However, the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations $\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection $\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute- and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of different stages of the model generation pipeline.

<title>FlashSVD: Memory-Efficient Inference with Streaming for Low-Rank Models</title>

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension, prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world, on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models. FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover, on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies, further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent periodic patterns.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models (e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs, even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution, resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees, were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of 0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke refinement and technique improvement.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness. Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is $O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural ODEs.

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data. While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes, trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions, NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original training objectives.

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path. Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on unseen synthetic graphs.

<title>KANMixer: Can KAN Serve as a New Modeling Core for Long-term Time Series Forecasting?</title>

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures. Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore, we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

<title>Dynamic Clustering for Personalized Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Edge Devices</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm, and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in recent years has catalyzed transformative advances in wireless communications and networks. Among the members of the GenAI family, Diffusion Models (DMs) have risen to prominence as a powerful option, capable of handling complex, high-dimensional data distribution, as well as consistent, noise-robust performance. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and practical applications of DMs across future communication systems. We first provide an extensive tutorial of DMs and demonstrate how they can be applied to enhance optimizers, reinforcement learning and incentive mechanisms, which are popular approaches for problems in wireless networks. Then, we review and discuss the DM-based methods proposed for emerging issues in future networks and communications, including channel modeling and estimation, signal detection and data reconstruction, integrated sensing and communication, resource management in edge computing networks, semantic communications and other notable issues. We conclude the survey with highlighting technical limitations of DMs and their applications, as well as discussing future research directions.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling, our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator, guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy generative design.

<title>Why Heuristic Weighting Works: A Theoretical Analysis of Denoising Score Matching</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01597</link>

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution, a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity, can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts. Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of \textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially, collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models, with reinforcement learning serving as the key technique to draw out complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, such as those in the OpenAI O series, Claude 3 series, DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 series, and Grok 3 series, remain undisclosed, making it difficult for the research community to replicate their reinforcement learning training results. Therefore, we start our study from an Early Preview Reinforcement Learning (EPRLI) algorithm built on the open-source GRPO framework, incorporating difficulty-aware intervention for math problems. Applied to a 1.5B-parameter LLM, our method achieves 50.0% on AIME24, 89.2% on Math500, 77.1% on AMC, 35.3% on Minerva, and 51.9% on OBench, superpass O1-Preview and is comparable to O1-mini within standard school-lab settings.

<title>Augmented Reinforcement Learning Framework For Enhancing Decision-Making In Machine Learning Models Using External Agents</title>

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model, identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere. The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

<title>TCDiff: Triplex Cascaded Diffusion for High-fidelity Multimodal EHRs Generation with Incomplete Clinical Data</title>

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs) remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data, formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking. Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate, while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore, we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal performance degradation.

<title>Learning Unified System Representations for Microservice Tail Latency Prediction</title>

arXiv:2508.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management. Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services, ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$ speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott \emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues. We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency and accuracy.

arXiv:2508.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server, including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and memory consumption

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power, data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence. Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$ belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB, and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB, deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$, being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and $\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of both settings.

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel, hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset (CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient, processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured data.

<title>From SHAP to Rules: Distilling Expert Knowledge from Post-hoc Model Explanations in Time Series Classification</title>

arXiv:2508.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification is challenging due to inherent difficulty in raw time series interpretation and doubled down by the high dimensionality. We propose a framework that converts numeric feature attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into structured, human-readable rules. These rules define intervals indicating when and where they apply, improving transparency. Our approach performs comparably to native rule-based methods like Anchor while scaling better to long TS and covering more instances. Rule fusion integrates rule sets through methods such as weighted selection and lasso-based refinement to balance coverage, confidence, and simplicity, ensuring all instances receive an unambiguous, metric-optimized rule. It enhances explanations even for a single explainer. We introduce visualization techniques to manage specificity-generalization trade-offs. By aligning with expert-system principles, our framework consolidates conflicting or overlapping explanations - often resulting from the Rashomon effect - into coherent and domain-adaptable insights. Experiments on UCI datasets confirm that the resulting rule-based representations improve interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS classification.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras, limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance, achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of 0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and robust HAR systems.

<title>Neural Policy Iteration for Stochastic Optimal Control: A Physics-Informed Approach</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI) framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings, inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

<title>OccamVTS: Distilling Vision Models to 1% Parameters for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust, automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning (FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control. We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio, quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions. Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior convergence speed and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex conditioning scenarios.

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and fine tuning of an LLM.

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis, such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation, extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and (2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics. During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions, indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics. This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research and practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability, and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical deployment.

arXiv:2508.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation. However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e., the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states), emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the "Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our findings on steerability dynamics.

<title>Revisiting Replay and Gradient Alignment for Continual Pre-Training of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100 billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of replaying old examples.

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way? Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to ``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing. Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding model internals and building circuits.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations. Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata. Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality (number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes 'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins. Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in few-shot concept learning.

<title>Flow-Aware GNN for Transmission Network Reconfiguration via Substation Breaker Optimization</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network (LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial optimization in physical networked systems.

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

<title>Kronecker-LoRA: hybrid Kronecker-LoRA adapters for scalable, sustainable fine-tuning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce \textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A \otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an 840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a 5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a 3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy, Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression, quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis, Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

<title>Accelerating LLM Reasoning via Early Rejection with Partial Reward Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$ reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

<title>Improving Hospital Risk Prediction with Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal EHR Modeling</title>

arXiv:2508.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial, task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$, respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

<title>Revitalizing Canonical Pre-Alignment for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

arXiv:2508.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations. Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1) Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain. Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others, which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i) distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii) systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based inverse problem solvers.

<title>Controllable and Stealthy Shilling Attacks via Dispersive Latent Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms, but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users. Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that, compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.

<title>Toward Efficient Spiking Transformers: Synapse Pruning Meets Synergistic Learning-Based Compensation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs, thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models. Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured $\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF) neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and high-performing ST-based models.

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and 10.68% increase in ROI.

<title>An Evolving Scenario Generation Method based on Dual-modal Driver Model Trained by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation method.

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to 65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance, medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

arXiv:2508.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult, for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source data-free supervised transfer learning.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations. Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future epidemic containment. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Epi-2-Net-48CE.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics, while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT) samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently, Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions, thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation (OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA) hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers, enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF) Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL), a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation. Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance. Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization, and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

<title>Instance-Dependent Continuous-Time Reinforcement Learning via Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success, its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the environment.

<title>Real-Time Conflict Prediction for Large Truck Merging in Mixed Traffic at Work Zone Lane Closures</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02109</link>

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models. Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly observed with the baseline approaches.

<title>Understanding the Essence: Delving into Annotator Prototype Learning for Multi-Class Annotation Aggregation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02123</link>

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However, these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning. Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators. Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness, smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural systems.

<title>Amber Pruner: Leveraging N:M Activation Sparsity for Efficient Prefill in Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation AI systems.

<title>The Complexity of Extreme Climate Events on the New Zealand's Kiwifruit Industry</title>

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand. We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events, specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

<title>FedLAD: A Linear Algebra Based Data Poisoning Defence for Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system. Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge. This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and 0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact. We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data. AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of 16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards. Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior performance and ease of training.

<title>User Trajectory Prediction Unifying Global and Local Temporal Information</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN), and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions, enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally, CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction, while maintaining similar inference time.

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform. However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings. Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits. Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a 2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false) queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$ LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process, LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/LeanK.

<title>Multi-Policy Pareto Front Tracking Based Online and Offline Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking (MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies, whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front. Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front, starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front. Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment interactions and hardware requirements.

arXiv:2508.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy. To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future intelligent wireless networks.

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage. Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for learning-based shortest path search.

However, autonomously building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules: Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus. We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction, using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling challenge.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution. Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included to interpret the results.

<title>Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner: An Efficient Neural Network Pruning Method</title>

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error, which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally, FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate. Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG) demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations, hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality, though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

<title>CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Verifiable Generative Credit Assignment</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning (RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

<title>NMS: Efficient Edge DNN Training via Near-Memory Sampling on Manifolds</title>

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections, leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

<title>A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of Chaotic Maps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01', `10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems, symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression, which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information processing.

<title>BOOST: Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition Function Selection Technique</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset, evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse problem landscapes.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings. In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood, especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for posterior sampling of word embeddings.

<title>MicroMix: Efficient Mixed-Precision Quantization with Microscaling Formats for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error. Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX 5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models, MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/lwy2020/MicroMix.

<title>A Novel Sliced Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however, challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries, strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW. Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance; especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

<title>Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02381</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g., layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods, outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1 minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52 second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE) into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise, particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error $\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

<title>Toward Using Machine Learning as a Shape Quality Metric for Liver Point Cloud Generation</title>

arXiv:2508.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML) methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight, task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape modeling.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training. However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning, it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process, which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods. Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness of other established methods.

<title>Clinical Expert Uncertainty Guided Generalized Label Smoothing for Medical Noisy Label Learning</title>

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However, these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or ``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and, more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed base node distribution.

<title>AnalogCoder-Pro: Unifying Analog Circuit Generation and Optimization via Multi-modal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists, AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

<title>Communication and Computation Efficient Split Federated Learning in O-RAN</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02534</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs). However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time, jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

<title>Solved in Unit Domain: JacobiNet for Differentiable Coordinate Transformations</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement, and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions, and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to 0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors) disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces. We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with AS.

<title>Explainable AI Methods for Neuroimaging: Systematic Failures of Common Tools, the Need for Domain-Specific Validation, and a Proposal for Safe Application</title>

arXiv:2508.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad, which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

<title>Dynamic Feature Selection based on Rule-based Learning for Explainable Classification with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02566</link>

arXiv:2508.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set, DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however, existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces, struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training, we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover, the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

<title>StructSynth: Leveraging LLMs for Structure-Aware Tabular Data Synthesis in Low-Data Regimes</title>

arXiv:2508.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution, traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data, leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture. First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage}, TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged by other large-scale industrial models.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible, interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and dynamical settings.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values, class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings, achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools. AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

arXiv:2508.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK), where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN), which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data, enabling new approaches to effect design.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However, existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices, preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is available at \href{https://github.com/JiaxiLi1/LOST-Low-rank-and-Sparse-Training-for-Large-Language-Models}{LOST Repo}

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However, scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset, and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with 43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments. Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles of both educators and students.

Abstract: We introduce Bike-Bench, an engineering design benchmark for evaluating generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and constraints. As generative AI's reach continues to grow, evaluating its capability to understand physical laws, human guidelines, and hard constraints grows increasingly important. Engineering product design lies at the intersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI capabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs that not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives and constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered and multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics, structural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text or image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation results, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a synthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric, CAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to evaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid algorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular generative models fall short of optimization and optimization-augmented generative models in both validity and optimality scores, suggesting significant room for improvement. We hope Bike-Bench, a first-of-its-kind benchmark, will help catalyze progress in generative AI for constrained multi-objective engineering design problems. Code, data, and other resources are published at decode.mit.edu/projects/bikebench/.

This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more -- that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks, and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained design manifolds.

Abstract: The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries. Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties (specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.

<title>Cognitive Exoskeleton: Augmenting Human Cognition with an AI-Mediated Intelligent Visual Feedback</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an AI-mediated framework that can provide intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues, limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i) a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness, particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts: FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency. Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

<title>Learned LSM-trees: Two Approaches Using Learned Bloom Filters</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for write optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification. Auxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that scale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data structures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these components, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this work, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the LSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom filter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query latency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned models and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without compromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style LSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic workloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up to 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision, though it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design achieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory usage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary trade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the potential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality \textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm. Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm. Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact center conversations.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However, existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability. Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks. Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the $k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial and matrix techniques.

Abstract: Cross-process root-cause analysis of wafer defects is among the most critical yet challenging tasks in semiconductor manufacturing due to the heterogeneity and combinatorial nature of processes along the processing route. This paper presents a new framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Potential Loss Analysis (PLA), as a significant enhancement of the previously proposed partial trajectory regression approach. The PLA framework attributes observed high wafer defect densities to upstream processes by comparing the best possible outcomes generated by partial processing trajectories. We show that the task of identifying the best possible outcome can be reduced to solving a Bellman equation. Remarkably, the proposed framework can simultaneously solve the prediction problem for defect density as well as the attribution problem for defect scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real wafer history data.

<title>ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI</title>

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust. Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise. This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic, step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical decision support.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT), time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments, particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1% absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model, Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks, as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet management.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core, Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes 3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a 3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10 datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions. This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism understanding.

Abstract: Visualizing uncertainty is integral to data analysis, yet its application is often hindered by the need for specialized methods for quantifying and representing uncertainty for different types of graphics. We introduce a general approach that simplifies this process. The core idea is to treat the statistical graphic as a function of the underlying distribution. Instead of first calculating uncertainty metrics and then plotting them, the method propagates uncertainty through to the visualization. By repeatedly sampling from the data distribution and generating a complete statistical graphic for each sample, a distribution over graphics is produced. These graphics are aggregated pixel-by-pixel to create a single, static image. This approach is versatile, requires no specific knowledge from the user beyond how to create the basic statistical graphic, and comes with theoretical coverage guarantees for standard cases such as confidence intervals and bands. We provide a reference implementation as a Python library to demonstrate the method's utility. Our approach not only reproduces conventional uncertainty visualizations for point estimates and regression lines but also seamlessly extends to non-standard cases, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and tables. This approach makes uncertainty visualization more accessible to practitioners and can be a valuable tool for teaching uncertainty.

Building on our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Abstract: We present an updated deep neural network model for inclusive electron-carbon scattering. Using the bootstrap model [Phys.Rev.C 110 (2024) 2, 025501] as a prior, we incorporate recent experimental data, as well as older measurements in the deep inelastic scattering region, to derive a re-optimized posterior model. We examine the impact of these new inputs on model predictions and associated uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the resulting cross-section predictions in the kinematic range relevant to the Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments.

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT, Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds, AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of 0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts solving iris PAD visual task.

Abstract: This replication study modifies ALMM, the Adaptive Linear Mapping Model constructed for the next song recommendation, to the news recommendation problem on the MIND dataset. The original version of ALMM computes latent representations for users, last-time items, and current items in a tensor factorization structure and learns a linear mapping from content features to latent item vectors. Our replication aims to improve recommendation performance in cold-start scenarios by restructuring this model to sequential news click behavior, viewing consecutively read articles as (last news, next news) tuples. Instead of the original audio features, we apply BERT and a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to news titles and abstracts to extract token contextualized representations and align them with triplet-based user reading patterns. We also propose a reproducibly thorough pre-processing pipeline combining news filtering and feature integrity validation. Our implementation of ALMM with TF-IDF shows relatively improved recommendation accuracy and robustness over Forbes and Oord baseline models in the cold-start scenario. We demonstrate that ALMM in a minimally modified state is not suitable for next news recommendation.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload. Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs, leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Abstract: Motivated by canonical problems in medical diagnostics, we propose and study properties of an objective function that uniformly bounds uncertainties in quantities of interest extracted from classifiers and related data analysis tools. We begin by adopting a set-theoretic perspective to show how two main tasks in diagnostics -- classification and prevalence estimation -- can be recast in terms of a variation on the confusion (or error) matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$ typically considered in supervised learning. We then combine arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity) yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation. In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$. We also consider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary solution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the confusion matrix.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual (image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass, size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast, learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization (CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.

<title>Towards Bridging Review Sparsity in Recommendation with Textual Edge Graph Representation</title>

Abstract: Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques -- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines, delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for improved recommendations.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues. COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g., appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks, where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset.

<title>DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of database systems is critical to ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&amp;M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&amp;M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&amp;M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&amp;M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

<title>Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension, we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern data science. However, how to accurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we introduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from the last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic neural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a validation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations. We establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in particular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is essential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence intervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and achieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques. Additionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform to adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP, ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient, backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training regime.

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples, we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms. Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step. In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and succession trajectories compared to a fully mechanistic version of FINN. Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible, improved functional form of growth, which we extracted from the DNN using explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools & data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

Abstract: Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS, BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model, is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency, FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework, two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module, to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor (KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder. Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers previous category information and returns category-adaptive representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD, respectively.

Abstract: To reach human level intelligence, learning algorithms need to incorporate causal reasoning. But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual reasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this task by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for mitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects. While IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the population level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically assume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under standard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in treatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the treatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed data. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We implement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the likelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the underlying outcome function. We call our method Flow IV.

<title>Debiasing Machine Learning Predictions for Causal Inference Without Additional Ground Truth Data: "One Map, Many Trials" in Satellite-Driven Poverty Analysis</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in data-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction methods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled data. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear transformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's learning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using Demographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods meet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to training pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may represent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a "one map, many trials" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces predictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines.

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories. This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7 to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

Abstract: The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.

<title>Reconstructing Trust Embeddings from Siamese Trust Scores: A Direct-Sum Approach with Fixed-Point Semantics</title>

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x 10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

<title>PESTO: Real-Time Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised Transposition-equivariant Objective</title>

arXiv:2508.01488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition, we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective, eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets (MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of recommender systems.

Abstract: Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations. Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions. However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid scenarios.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models. Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this, we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41 tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact model size.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models. We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as 2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to 13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation, cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese. The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1, comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs. To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF), characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones. Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning, pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness. Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements, including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1% in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and advancing structure-based drug design.

<title>Efficient optimization of expensive black-box simulators via marginal means, with application to neutrino detector design</title>

Abstract: With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g., the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs $\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases. Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner'' (PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM) approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$ that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance. Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods, thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector optimization in nuclear physics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust speech processing.

<title>ACT-Tensor: Tensor Completion Framework for Financial Dataset Imputation</title>

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies. Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio. These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

Abstract: To speed up Gaussian process inference, a number of fast kernel matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) approximation algorithms have been proposed over the years. In this paper, we establish an exact fast kernel MVM algorithm based on exact kernel decomposition into weighted empirical cumulative distribution functions, compatible with a class of kernels which includes multivariate Mat\'ern kernels with half-integer smoothness parameter. This algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach, during which sorting outputs are stored in a data structure. We also propose a new algorithm to take into account some linear fixed effects predictor function. Our numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm is very effective for low-dimensional Gaussian process inference problems with hundreds of thousands of data points. An implementation of our algorithm is available at https://gitlab.com/warin/fastgaussiankernelregression.git.

Abstract: Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic health record data from the MIMIC-III database.

Abstract: IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates (IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the context and suggests placement depending on the use case.

<title>EgoTrigger: Toward Audio-Driven Image Capture for Human Memory Enhancement in All-Day Energy-Efficient Smart Glasses</title>

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach, EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components (e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use -- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally, we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images, setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

<title>Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome Prediction</title>

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance. Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in 147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task 3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem, differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

<title>Convolutions are Competitive with Transformers for Encrypted Traffic Classification with Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity; (2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape, highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection, while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to examining permission trends across years and app features such as advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically, NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii) employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data mixing strategy, and reward design.

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce concise, high-performing prompts.

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test (SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models, and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and guides the development of new methods to combat it.

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational complexity of important information while retaining complete information, achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings. Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods. Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability effectively.

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary, despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and open new directions in the study of semi-random models, computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference problems.

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion).

Abstract: There has been significant research effort developing neural-network-based predictors of SQ in recent years. While a primary objective has been to develop non-intrusive, i.e.~reference-free, metrics to assess the performance of SE systems, recent work has also investigated the direct inference of neural SQ predictors within the loss function of downstream speech tasks. To aid in the training of SQ predictors, several large datasets of audio with corresponding human labels of quality have been created. Recent work in this area has shown that speech representations derived from large unsupervised or semi-supervised foundational speech models are useful input feature representations for neural SQ prediction. In this work, a novel and robust SQ predictor is proposed based on feature representations extracted from an ASR model, found to be a powerful input feature for the SQ prediction task. The proposed system achieves higher correlation with human MOS ratings than recent approaches on all NISQA test sets and shows significantly better domain adaption compared to the commonly used DNSMOS metric.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT, an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods, achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

<title>ByteGen: A Tokenizer-Free Generative Model for Orderbook Events in Byte Space</title>

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen, a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules. Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions, heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

Abstract: Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe complications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is essential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as electrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on specialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature. Existing contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face significant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia patients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.
  In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system that accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse waveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis. The key contributions of our work include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates reflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model that transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies. Our evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients shows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in healthy subjects.

Abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al. (2025). We highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the advantages of the different methods for different use cases.

<title>Do Edges Matter? Investigating Edge-Enhanced Pre-Training for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance. However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities. In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw data only.

Abstract: Financial AI holds great promise for transforming modern finance, with the potential to support a wide range of tasks such as market forecasting, portfolio management, quantitative trading, and automated analysis. However, existing platforms remain limited in task coverage, lack robust multimodal data integration, and offer insufficient support for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). In response to these limitations, we present FinWorld, an all-in-one open-source platform that provides end-to-end support for the entire financial AI workflow, from data acquisition to experimentation and deployment. FinWorld distinguishes itself through native integration of heterogeneous financial data, unified support for diverse AI paradigms, and advanced agent automation, enabling seamless development and deployment. Leveraging data from 2 representative markets, 4 stock pools, and over 800 million financial data points, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 4 key financial AI tasks. These experiments systematically evaluate deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, with particular emphasis on RL-based finetuning for LLMs and LLM Agents. The empirical results demonstrate that FinWorld significantly enhances reproducibility, supports transparent benchmarking, and streamlines deployment, thereby providing a strong foundation for future research and real-world applications.

<title>Towards Real Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Via Confident Meta-Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention. However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools. We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for early personalized risk stratification.

<title>CAMERA: Multi-Matrix Joint Compression for MoE Models via Micro-Expert Redundancy Analysis</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates (median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI): 1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination for regular monitoring.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a serious and debilitating disease affecting millions around the world. Its early detection using non-invasive means could enable preventive interventions that improve quality of life and patient outcomes, with speech recently shown to be a valuable biomarker. Yet, its validity across different linguistic groups remains to be seen. To that end, audio data were collected from 96 Danish participants conducting three speech tasks (reading, coughing, sustained vowels). Half of the participants were diagnosed with different levels of COPD and the other half formed a healthy control group. Subsequently, we investigated different baseline models using openSMILE features and learnt x-vector embeddings. We obtained a best accuracy of 67% using openSMILE features and logistic regression. Our findings support the potential of speech-based analysis as a non-invasive, remote, and scalable screening tool as part of future COPD healthcare solutions.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose \textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation, human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts. Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question, given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization, neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably, we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%. These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter methodological standards and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents' returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control, such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control (leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall fairness in agents' returns.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here, through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability, providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial intelligence of the future.

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios, traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs. Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem, we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly, we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text, video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However, practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs' affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in process control due to its interpretability and ability to handle constraints. As a parametric policy in reinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data requirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most RL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter spaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy update requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC. While MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to second-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order policy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.
  This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy Hessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling superlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve robustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable training under noisy estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), showing faster convergence and improved data efficiency over state-of-the-art first-order methods.

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow. We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES (Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over 20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6% and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside 91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models. Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at https://youtu.be/yGoyYOe6fbY.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation, and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15 open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies: zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought. Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally constrained literary texts.

<title>Causality and Interpretability for Electrical Distribution System faults</title>

Abstract: Causal analysis helps us understand variables that are responsible for system failures. This improves fault detection and makes system more reliable. In this work, we present a new method that combines causal inference with machine learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems (EDS) using graph-based models. We first build causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE). Each fault case is represented as a graph, where the nodes are features such as voltage and current, and the edges demonstrate how these features influence each other. Then, the graphs are classified using machine learning and GraphSAGE where the model learns from both the node values and the structure of the graph to predict the type of fault. To make the predictions understandable, we further developed an integrated approach using GNNExplainer and Captums Integrated Gradients to highlight the nodes (features) that influences the most on the final prediction. This gives us clear insights into the possible causes of the fault. Our experiments show high accuracy: 99.44% on the EDS fault dataset, which is better than state of art models. By combining causal graphs with machine learning, our method not only predicts faults accurately but also helps understand their root causes. This makes it a strong and practical tool for improving system reliability.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that, while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to do so.

<title>Contextual Graph Transformer: A Small Language Model for Enhanced Engineering Document Information Extraction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02532</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text, often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering. CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram, and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical domains often require specialized language models with stronger contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses in real-world applications.

<title>CSI Obfuscation: Single-Antenna Transmitters Can Not Hide from Adversarial Multi-Antenna Radio Localization Systems</title>

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

<title>Automated SNOMED CT Concept Annotation in Clinical Text Using Bi-GRU Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models, making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

<title>EHSAN: Leveraging ChatGPT in a Hybrid Framework for Arabic Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment. To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes, with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

<title>CAMA: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models with Causal Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician (\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit, reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies. To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph, which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations alone.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples. Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models to ``inverse problems'' to infer hidden parameters from observed data. While these methods can handle intractable models and large-scale studies, they can also produce biased or overconfident conclusions. We present a solution with Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes AI-generated probability distributions into confidence regions that consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences: identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation: agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a powerful data-driven method for analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex, high-dimensional systems. However, conventional DMD methods are limited to matrix-based formulations, which might be inefficient or inadequate for modeling inherently multidimensional data including images, videos, and higher-order networks. In this letter, we propose tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel extension of DMD to third-order tensors based on the recently developed T-product framework. By incorporating tensor factorization techniques, TDMD achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of spatial and temporal structures in multiway data for tasks such as state reconstruction and dynamic component separation, compared to standard DMD with data flattening. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TDMD on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air, water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe negative impact on communities.

Abstract: In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is, by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity (however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in hindsight. Our main contribution is a $\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest.

Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT) provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source, high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of 28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning. Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.

Abstract: Network embedding, aiming to project a network into a low-dimensional space, is increasingly becoming a focus of network research. Semi-supervised network embedding takes advantage of labeled data, and has shown promising performance. However, existing semi-supervised methods would get unappealing results in the completely-imbalanced label setting where some classes have no labeled nodes at all. To alleviate this, we propose two novel semi-supervised network embedding methods. The first one is a shallow method named RSDNE. Specifically, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RSDNE guarantees both intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity in an approximate way. The other method is RECT which is a new class of graph neural networks. Different from RSDNE, to benefit from the completely-imbalanced labels, RECT explores the class-semantic knowledge. This enables RECT to handle networks with node features and multi-label setting. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods. Code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang100/RECT.

Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-making systems are increasingly popular, significant concerns on the potential discrimination during the AI decision-making process have been observed. For example, the distribution of predictions is usually biased and dependents on the sensitive attributes (e.g., gender and ethnicity). Numerous approaches have therefore been proposed to develop decision-making systems that are discrimination-conscious by-design, which are typically batch-based and require the simultaneous availability of all the training data for model learning. However, in the real-world, the data streams usually come on the fly which requires the model to process each input data once ``on arrival'' and without the need for storage and reprocessing. In addition, the data streams might also evolve over time, which further requires the model to be able to simultaneously adapt to non-stationary data distributions and time-evolving bias patterns, with an effective and robust trade-off between accuracy and fairness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of online decision tree with fairness in the data stream with possible distribution drifting. Specifically, first, we propose two novel fairness splitting criteria that encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously removing dependence on the sensitive attributes, and further adapts to non-stationary distribution with fine-grained control when needed. Second, we propose two fairness decision tree online growth algorithms that fulfills different online fair decision-making requirements. Our experiments show that our algorithms are able to deal with discrimination in massive and non-stationary streaming environments, with a better trade-off between fairness and predictive performance.

Abstract: AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved superhuman performance in many complex board games such as Chess, Shogi, and Go. However, we showcase that these algorithms encounter significant and fundamental challenges when applied to impartial games, a class where players share game pieces and optimal strategy often relies on abstract mathematical principles. Specifically, we utilize the game of Nim as a concrete and illustrative case study to reveal critical limitations of AlphaZero-style and similar self-play RL algorithms. We introduce a novel conceptual framework distinguishing between champion and expert mastery to evaluate RL agent performance. Our findings reveal that while AlphaZero-style agents can achieve champion-level play on very small Nim boards, their learning progression severely degrades as the board size increases. This difficulty stems not merely from complex data distributions or noisy labels, but from a deeper representational bottleneck: the inherent struggle of generic neural networks to implicitly learn abstract, non-associative functions like parity, which are crucial for optimal play in impartial games. This limitation causes a critical breakdown in the positive feedback loop essential for self-play RL, preventing effective learning beyond rote memorization of frequently observed states. These results align with broader concerns regarding AlphaZero-style algorithms' vulnerability to adversarial attacks, highlighting their inability to truly master all legal game states. Our work underscores that simple hyperparameter adjustments are insufficient to overcome these challenges, establishing a crucial foundation for the development of fundamentally novel algorithmic approaches, potentially involving neuro-symbolic or meta-learning paradigms, to bridge the gap towards true expert-level AI in combinatorial games.

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse provides actionable recommendations to alter unfavorable predictions of machine learning models, enhancing transparency through counterfactual explanations. While significant progress has been made in algorithmic recourse for static data, such as tabular and image data, limited research explores recourse for multivariate time series, particularly for reversing abnormal time series. This paper introduces Recourse in time series Anomaly Detection (RecAD), a framework for addressing anomalies in multivariate time series using backtracking counterfactual reasoning. By modeling the causes of anomalies as external interventions on exogenous variables, RecAD predicts recourse actions to restore normal status as counterfactual explanations, where the recourse function, responsible for generating actions based on observed data, is trained using an end-to-end approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.

Abstract: We investigate the contextual bandits with knapsack (CBwK) problem in a high-dimensional linear setting, where the feature dimension can be very large. Our goal is to harness sparsity to obtain sharper regret guarantees. To this end, we first develop an online variant of the hard thresholding algorithm that performs the sparse estimation in an online manner. We then embed this estimator in a primal-dual scheme: every knapsack constraint is paired with a dual variable, which is updated by an online learning rule to keep the cumulative resource consumption within budget. This integrated approach achieves a two-phase sub-linear regret that scales only logarithmically with the feature dimension, improving on the polynomial dependency reported in prior work. Furthermore, we show that either of the following structural assumptions is sufficient for a sharper regret bound of $\tilde{O}(s_{0} \sqrt{T})$: (i) a diverse-covariate condition; and (ii) a margin condition. When both conditions hold simultaneously, we can further control the regret to $O(s_{0}^{2} \log(dT)\log T)$ by a dual resolving scheme. As a by-product, applying our framework to high-dimensional contextual bandits without knapsack constraints recovers the optimal regret rates in both the data-poor and data-rich regimes. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the empirical efficiency of our algorithms in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are prominent in graph machine learning and have shown state-of-the-art performance in Link Prediction (LP) tasks. Nonetheless, recent studies show that GNNs struggle to produce good results on low-degree nodes despite their overall strong performance. In practical applications of LP, like recommendation systems, improving performance on low-degree nodes is critical, as it amounts to tackling the cold-start problem of improving the experiences of users with few observed interactions. In this paper, we investigate improving GNNs' LP performance on low-degree nodes while preserving their performance on high-degree nodes and propose a simple yet surprisingly effective augmentation technique called NodeDup. Specifically, NodeDup duplicates low-degree nodes and creates links between nodes and their own duplicates before following the standard supervised LP training scheme. By leveraging a ''multi-view'' perspective for low-degree nodes, NodeDup shows significant LP performance improvements on low-degree nodes without compromising any performance on high-degree nodes. Additionally, as a plug-and-play augmentation module, NodeDup can be easily applied to existing GNNs with very light computational cost. Extensive experiments show that NodeDup achieves 38.49%, 13.34%, and 6.76% improvements on isolated, low-degree, and warm nodes, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to GNNs and state-of-the-art cold-start methods.

Abstract: Predictions in the form of probability distributions are crucial for effective decision-making. Quantile regression enables such predictions within spatial prediction settings that aim to create improved precipitation datasets by merging remote sensing and gauge data. However, ensemble learning of quantile regression algorithms remains unexplored in this context and, at the same time, it has not been substantially developed so far in the broader machine learning research landscape. Here, we introduce nine quantile-based ensemble learners and address the aforementioned gap in precipitation dataset creation by presenting the first application of these learners to large precipitation datasets. We employed a novel feature engineering strategy, which reduces the number of predictors by using distance-weighted satellite precipitation at relevant locations, combined with location elevation. Our ensemble learners include six that are based on stacking ideas and three simple methods (mean, median, best combiner). Each of them combines the following six individual algorithms: quantile regression (QR), quantile regression forests (QRF), generalized random forests (GRF), gradient boosting machines (GBM), light gradient boosting machines (LightGBM), and quantile regression neural networks (QRNN). These algorithms serve as both base learners and combiners within different ensemble learning methods. We evaluated performance against a reference method (i.e., QR) using quantile scoring functions and a large dataset. The latter comprises 15 years of monthly gauge-measured and satellite precipitation in the contiguous United States (CONUS). Ensemble learning with QR and QRNN yielded the best results across the various investigated quantile levels, which range from 0.025 to 0.975, outperforming the reference method by 3.91% to 8.95%...

Abstract: Intensity control is a type of continuous-time dynamic optimization problems with many important applications in Operations Research including queueing and revenue management. In this study, we adapt the reinforcement learning framework to intensity control using choice-based network revenue management as a case study, which is a classical problem in revenue management that features a large state space, a large action space and a continuous time horizon. We show that by utilizing the inherent discretization of the sample paths created by the jump points, a unique and defining feature of intensity control, one does not need to discretize the time horizon in advance, which was believed to be necessary because most reinforcement learning algorithms are designed for discrete-time problems. As a result, the computation can be facilitated and the discretization error is significantly reduced. We lay the theoretical foundation for the Monte Carlo and temporal difference learning algorithms for policy evaluation and develop policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithms for intensity control. Via a comprehensive numerical study, we demonstrate the benefit of our approach versus other state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: A popular method to perform adversarial attacks on neuronal networks is the so-called fast gradient sign method and its iterative variant. In this paper, we interpret this method as an explicit Euler discretization of a differential inclusion, where we also show convergence of the discretization to the associated gradient flow. To do so, we consider the concept of p-curves of maximal slope in the case $p=\infty$. We prove existence of $\infty$-curves of maximum slope and derive an alternative characterization via differential inclusions. Furthermore, we also consider Wasserstein gradient flows for potential energies, where we show that curves in the Wasserstein space can be characterized by a representing measure on the space of curves in the underlying Banach space, which fulfill the differential inclusion. The application of our theory to the finite-dimensional setting is twofold: On the one hand, we show that a whole class of normalized gradient descent methods (in particular signed gradient descent) converge, up to subsequences, to the flow, when sending the step size to zero. On the other hand, in the distributional setting, we show that the inner optimization task of adversarial training objective can be characterized via $\infty$-curves of maximum slope on an appropriate optimal transport space.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without centralizing data. However, existing approaches such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg) often perform poorly with heterogeneous data distributions, failing to achieve personalization owing to their inability to capture class-specific information effectively. We propose Class-wise Federated Averaging (cwFedAvg), a novel personalized FL (PFL) framework that performs Federated Averaging for each class, to overcome the personalization limitations of FedAvg. cwFedAvg creates class-specific global models via weighted aggregation of local models using class distributions, and subsequently combines them to generate personalized local models. We further propose Weight Distribution Regularizer (WDR), which encourages deep networks to encode class-specific information efficiently by aligning empirical and approximated class distributions derived from output layer weights, to facilitate effective class-wise aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of cwFedAvg with WDR over existing PFL methods through efficient personalization while maintaining the communication cost of FedAvg and avoiding additional local training and pairwise computations.

Abstract: Multi-agent credit assignment is a fundamental challenge for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where a team of agents learn from shared reward signals. The Individual-Global-Max (IGM) condition is a widely used principle for multi-agent credit assignment, requiring that the joint action determined by individual Q-functions maximizes the global Q-value. Meanwhile, the principle of maximum entropy has been leveraged to enhance exploration in MARL. However, we identify a critical limitation in existing maximum entropy MARL methods: a misalignment arises between local policies and the joint policy that maximizes the global Q-value, leading to violations of the IGM condition. To address this misalignment, we propose an order-preserving transformation. Building on it, we introduce ME-IGM, a novel maximum entropy MARL algorithm compatible with any credit assignment mechanism that satisfies the IGM condition while enjoying the benefits of maximum entropy exploration. We empirically evaluate two variants of ME-IGM: ME-QMIX and ME-QPLEX, in non-monotonic matrix games, and demonstrate their state-of-the-art performance across 17 scenarios in SMAC-v2 and Overcooked.

Abstract: Forecasting multiple future events within a given time horizon is essential for applications in finance, retail, social networks, and healthcare. Marked Temporal Point Processes (MTPP) provide a principled framework to model both the timing and labels of events. However, most existing research focuses on predicting only the next event, leaving long-horizon forecasting largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce HoTPP, the first benchmark specifically designed to rigorously evaluate long-horizon predictions. We identify shortcomings in widely used evaluation metrics, propose a theoretically grounded T-mAP metric, present strong statistical baselines, and offer efficient implementations of popular models. Our empirical results demonstrate that modern MTPP approaches often underperform simple statistical baselines. Furthermore, we analyze the diversity of predicted sequences and find that most methods exhibit mode collapse. Finally, we analyze the impact of autoregression and intensity-based losses on prediction quality, and outline promising directions for future research. The HoTPP source code, hyperparameters, and full evaluation results are available at GitHub.

Abstract: As telecommunications networks become increasingly complex, the integration of advanced technologies such as network digital twins and generative artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a pivotal solution to enhance network operations and resilience. This paper explores the synergy between network digital twins, which provide a dynamic virtual representation of physical networks, and generative AI, particularly focusing on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a novel architectural framework that incorporates these technologies to significantly improve predictive maintenance, network scenario simulation, and real-time data-driven decision-making. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate how generative AI can enhance the accuracy and operational efficiency of network digital twins, effectively handling real-world complexities such as unpredictable traffic loads and network failures. The findings suggest that this integration not only boosts the capability of digital twins in scenario forecasting and anomaly detection but also facilitates a more adaptive and intelligent network management system.

Abstract: This work explores the in-context learning capabilities of State Space Models (SSMs) and presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical explanation of a possible underlying mechanism. We introduce a novel weight construction for SSMs, enabling them to predict the next state of any dynamical system after observing previous states without parameter fine-tuning. This is accomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuous SSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we find an explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptotic error bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of this continuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically. This work should be an initial step toward understanding how sequence models based on SSMs learn in context.

Abstract: The restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) framework is a popular model with applications across a wide variety of fields. However, its solution is hindered by the exponentially growing state space (with respect to the number of arms) and the combinatorial action space, making traditional reinforcement learning methods infeasible for large-scale instances. In this paper, we propose GINO-Q, a three-timescale stochastic approximation algorithm designed to learn an asymptotically optimal index policy for RMABs. GINO-Q mitigates the curse of dimensionality by decomposing the RMAB into a series of subproblems, each with the same dimension as a single arm, ensuring that complexity increases linearly with the number of arms. Unlike recently developed Whittle-index-based algorithms, GINO-Q does not require RMABs to be indexable, enhancing its flexibility and applicability. Our experimental results demonstrate that GINO-Q consistently learns near-optimal policies, even for non-indexable RMABs where Whittle-index-based algorithms perform poorly, and it converges significantly faster than existing baselines.

Abstract: We present three game-playing agents incorporating Vision Transformers (ViT) into the AlphaZero framework: AlphaViT, AlphaViD (AlphaViT with a transformer decoder), and AlphaVDA (AlphaViD with learnable action embeddings). These agents can play multiple board games of varying sizes using a single neural network with shared weights, thus overcoming AlphaZero's limitation of fixed board sizes. AlphaViT employs only a transformer encoder, whereas AlphaViD and AlphaVDA incorporate both a transformer encoder and a decoder. In AlphaViD, the decoder processes outputs from the encoder, whereas AlphaVDA uses learnable embeddings as the decoder inputs. The additional decoder in AlphaViD and AlphaVDA provides flexibility to adapt to various action spaces and board sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed agents, trained on either individual games or on multiple games simultaneously, consistently outperform traditional algorithms, such as Minimax and Monte Carlo Tree Search. They approach the performance of AlphaZero despite relying on a single deep neural network (DNN) with shared weights. In particular, AlphaViT performs strongly across all evaluated games. Furthermore, fine-tuning the DNN with weights pre-trained on small board games accelerates convergence and improves performance, particularly in Gomoku. Interestingly, simultaneous training on multiple games yields performance comparable to, or even surpassing, that of single-game training. These results indicate the potential of transformer-based architectures for developing more flexible and robust game-playing AI agents that excel in multiple games and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to detect test samples outside the training category space, which is an essential component in building reliable machine learning systems. Existing reviews on OOD detection primarily focus on method taxonomy, surveying the field by categorizing various approaches. However, many recent works concentrate on non-traditional OOD detection scenarios, such as test-time adaptation, multi-modal data sources and other novel contexts. In this survey, we uniquely review recent advances in OOD detection from the task-oriented perspective for the first time. According to the user's access to the model, that is, whether the OOD detection method is allowed to modify or retrain the model, we classify the methods as training-driven or training-agnostic. Besides, considering the rapid development of pre-trained models, large pre-trained model-based OOD detection is also regarded as an important category and discussed separately. Furthermore, we provide a discussion of the evaluation scenarios, a variety of applications, and several future research directions. We believe this survey with new taxonomy will benefit the proposal of new methods and the expansion of more practical scenarios. A curated list of related papers is provided in the Github repository: https://github.com/shuolucs/Awesome-Out-Of-Distribution-Detection.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models often experience performance degradation due to data domain shifts introduced at test time, a challenge that is further amplified for child speakers. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have shown great potential in bridging this domain gap. However, the use of TTA to adapt ASR models to the individual differences in each child's speech has not yet been systematically studied. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of two widely used TTA methods-SUTA, SGEM-in adapting off-the-shelf ASR models and their fine-tuned versions for child speech recognition, with the goal of enabling continuous, unsupervised adaptation at test time. Our findings show that TTA significantly improves the performance of both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned ASR models, both on average and across individual child speakers, compared to unadapted baselines. However, while TTA helps adapt to individual variability, it may still be limited with non-linguistic child speech.

Abstract: The biases and discrimination of machine learning algorithms have attracted significant attention, leading to the development of various algorithms tailored to specific contexts. However, these solutions often fall short of addressing fairness issues inherent in machine learning operations. In this paper, we present an adaptive debiasing framework designed to find an optimal fair transformation of input data that maximally preserves data predictability under dynamic conditions. A distinctive feature of our approach is its flexibility and efficiency. It can be integrated with pretrained black-box classifiers, providing fairness guarantees with minimal retraining efforts, even in the face of frequent data drifts, evolving fairness requirements, and batches of similar tasks. To achieve this, we leverage the normalizing flows to enable efficient, information-preserving data transformation, ensuring that no critical information is lost during the debiasing process. Additionally, we incorporate the Wasserstein distance as the fairness measure to guide the optimization of data transformations. Finally, we introduce an efficient optimization algorithm with closed-formed gradient computations, making our framework scalable and suitable for dynamic, real-world environments.

Abstract: We introduce Functional Group-Aware Representations for Small Molecules (FARM), a novel foundation model designed to bridge the gap between SMILES, natural language, and molecular graphs. The key innovation of FARM lies in its functional group-aware tokenization, which directly incorporates functional group information into SMILES, enriching SMILES with detailed chemical context. For example, instead of using "O" to represent all oxygen atoms, we use specific tokens like "O_ketone" and "O_hydroxyl" to differentiate oxygen atoms belonging to distinct functional groups. This tokenization expands the chemical lexicon, effectively bridging the gap between SMILES and natural language in terms of vocabulary size, ultimately enhancing the model's ability to predict molecular properties. FARM also represents molecules from two perspectives: by (1) using masked language modeling to capture atom-level features and (2) employing graph neural networks to encode the whole molecule topology. FARM leverages contrastive learning to aligns these two views of representations into a unified molecular embedding. We rigorously evaluate FARM on the MoleculeNet dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 out of 13 tasks. These results highlight FARM's potential to improve molecular representation learning and demonstrate its strong transfer learning capabilities, paving the way for promising applications in drug discovery and pharmaceutical research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in ECG analysis and cardiovascular disease assessment. Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGFounder

Abstract: With the boom of machine learning (ML) techniques, software practitioners build ML systems to process the massive volume of streaming data for diverse software engineering tasks such as failure prediction in AIOps. Trained using historical data, such ML models encounter performance degradation caused by concept drift, i.e., data and inter-relationship (concept) changes between training and production. It is essential to use concept rift detection to monitor the deployed ML models and re-train the ML models when needed. In this work, we explore applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) concept drift detection techniques on synthetic and real-world datasets in an industrial setting. Such an industrial setting requires minimal manual effort in labeling and maximal generality in ML model architecture. We find that current SOTA semi-supervised methods not only require significant labeling effort but also only work for certain types of ML models. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic technique (CDSeer) for detecting concept drift. Our evaluation shows that CDSeer has better precision and recall compared to the state-of-the-art while requiring significantly less manual labeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CDSeer at concept drift detection by evaluating it on eight datasets from different domains and use cases. Results from internal deployment of CDSeer on an industrial proprietary dataset show a 57.1% improvement in precision while using 99% fewer labels compared to the SOTA concept drift detection method. The performance is also comparable to the supervised concept drift detection method, which requires 100% of the data to be labeled. The improved performance and ease of adoption of CDSeer are valuable in making ML systems more reliable.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a flexible and efficient method for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Among these methods, weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) is a promising approach that decomposes weight matrices into magnitude and direction components to mimic full fine-tuning (FT) better. However, DoRA's simultaneous optimization of these components makes it over-expressive, increases the risk of overfitting, and creates a coupled updating pattern that limits its learning capacity. To address these issues, we propose Bi-level Optimization-Based Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (BiDoRA), a novel PEFT method based on a bi-level optimization framework. BiDoRA fundamentally differs from DoRA by optimizing the magnitude and direction in two separate, asynchronous loops using distinct training and validation data splits. This decoupled optimization process effectively mitigates overfitting and allows for more flexible updates that align even more closely with FT. For instance, weight decomposition analysis shows BiDoRA achieves a magnitude-direction update correlation of $-8.042$, significantly closer to the FT ideal compared to $-1.784$ for DoRA. Evaluation of BiDoRA on diverse tasks spanning natural language understanding, generation, token classification, and extremely small biomedical datasets reveals that it consistently outperforms DoRA and a wide range of leading PEFT methods. This improvement is statistically significant, as demonstrated on the GLUE benchmark where BiDoRA surpasses DoRA with a p-value of $2.4\times10^{-4}$ in terms of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The code for BiDoRA is available at https://github.com/t2ance/BiDoRA.

Abstract: Mobile traffic forecasting allows operators to anticipate network dynamics and performance in advance, offering substantial potential for enhancing service quality and improving user experience. However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.

<title>Hierarchical Structure Sharing Empowers Multi-task Heterogeneous GNNs for Customer Expansion</title>

Abstract: Customer expansion, i.e., growing a business existing customer base by acquiring new customers, is critical for scaling operations and sustaining the long-term profitability of logistics companies. Although state-of-the-art works model this task as a single-node classification problem under a heterogeneous graph learning framework and achieve good performance, they struggle with extremely positive label sparsity issues in our scenario. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers a promising solution by introducing a correlated, label-rich task to enhance the label-sparse task prediction through knowledge sharing. However, existing MTL methods result in performance degradation because they fail to discriminate task-shared and task-specific structural patterns across tasks. This issue arises from their limited consideration of the inherently complex structure learning process of heterogeneous graph neural networks, which involves the multi-layer aggregation of multi-type relations. To address the challenge, we propose a Structure-Aware Hierarchical Information Sharing Framework (SrucHIS), which explicitly regulates structural information sharing across tasks in logistics customer expansion. SrucHIS breaks down the structure learning phase into multiple stages and introduces sharing mechanisms at each stage, effectively mitigating the influence of task-specific structural patterns during each stage. We evaluate StrucHIS on both private and public datasets, achieving a 51.41% average precision improvement on the private dataset and a 10.52% macro F1 gain on the public dataset. StrucHIS is further deployed at one of the largest logistics companies in China and demonstrates a 41.67% improvement in the success contract-signing rate over existing strategies, generating over 453K new orders within just two months.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly resource-intensive to fine-tune due to their enormous size. While low-rank adaptation is a prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, it suffers from sensitivity to hyperparameter choices, leading to instability in model performance on fine-tuning downstream tasks. This paper highlights the importance of effective parameterization in low-rank fine-tuning to reduce estimator variance and enhance the stability of final model outputs. We propose MonteCLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning technique that employs Monte Carlo estimation to learn an unbiased posterior estimation of low-rank parameters with low expected variance, stabilizing fine-tuned LLMs with only O(r) additional parameters, for a given rank r. MonteCLoRA shows 0.5% and 1.6% improvements in accuracy and robustness over unregularized low-rank adaptation method on natural language understanding tasks with pre-trained RoBERTa-base. Furthermore, in generative tasks with pre-trained LLaMA-1-7B and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, MonteCLoRA demonstrates robust performance with 50% and 62% lower spreads respectively than the contemporary efficient fine-tuning methods. The theoretical and empirical results presented in the paper underscore how parameterization and hyperpriors balance exploration-exploitation in the low-rank parametric space, therefore leading to more optimal and robust parameter estimation during efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \emph{quiver mutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of \emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently discover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\tilde{D}$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and parsimonious rules from mathematical data.

Abstract: Foundation models that bridge vision and language have made significant progress. While they have inspired many life-enriching applications, their potential for abuse in creating new threats remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we reveal that vision-language models (VLMs) can be weaponized to enhance gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) in federated learning (FL), where an FL server attempts to reconstruct private data samples from gradients shared by victim clients. Despite recent advances, existing GIAs struggle to reconstruct high-resolution images when the victim has a large local data batch. One promising direction is to focus reconstruction on valuable samples rather than the entire batch, but current methods lack the flexibility to target specific data of interest. To address this gap, we propose Geminio, the first approach to transform GIAs into semantically meaningful, targeted attacks. It enables a brand new privacy attack experience: attackers can describe, in natural language, the data they consider valuable, and Geminio will prioritize reconstruction to focus on those high-value samples. This is achieved by leveraging a pretrained VLM to guide the optimization of a malicious global model that, when shared with and optimized by a victim, retains only gradients of samples that match the attacker-specified query. Geminio can be launched at any FL round and has no impact on normal training (i.e., the FL server can steal clients' data while still producing a high-utility ML model as in benign scenarios). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing and reconstructing targeted samples, with high success rates across complex datasets and large batch sizes with resilience against defenses.

Abstract: Graph federated learning is of essential importance for training over large graph datasets while protecting data privacy, where each client stores a subset of local graph data, while the server collects the local gradients and broadcasts only the aggregated gradients. Recent studies reveal that a malicious attacker can steal private image data from the gradient exchange of neural networks during federated learning. However, the vulnerability of graph data and graph neural networks under such attacks, i.e., reconstructing both node features and graph structure from gradients, remains largely underexplored. To answer this question, this paper studies the problem of whether private data can be reconstructed from leaked gradients in both node classification and graph classification tasks and proposes a novel attack named Graph Leakage from Gradients (GLG). Two widely used GNN frameworks are analyzed, namely GCN and GraphSAGE. The effects of different model settings on reconstruction are extensively discussed. Theoretical analysis and empirical validation demonstrate that, by leveraging the unique properties of graph data and GNNs, GLG achieves more accurate reconstruction of both nodal features and graph structure from gradients.

Abstract: Overfitting has traditionally been viewed as detrimental to anomaly detection, where excessive generalization often limits models' sensitivity to subtle anomalies. Our work challenges this conventional view by introducing Controllable Overfitting-based Anomaly Detection (COAD), a novel framework that strategically leverages overfitting to enhance anomaly discrimination capabilities. We propose the Aberrance Retention Quotient (ARQ), a novel metric that systematically quantifies the extent of overfitting, enabling the identification of an optimal golden overfitting interval wherein model sensitivity to anomalies is maximized without sacrificing generalization. To comprehensively capture how overfitting affects detection performance, we further propose the Relative Anomaly Distribution Index (RADI), a metric superior to traditional AUROC by explicitly modeling the separation between normal and anomalous score distributions. Theoretically, RADI leverages ARQ to track and evaluate how overfitting impacts anomaly detection, offering an integrated approach to understanding the relationship between overfitting dynamics and model efficacy. We also rigorously validate the statistical efficacy of Gaussian noise as pseudo-anomaly generators, reinforcing the method's broad applicability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our controllable overfitting method achieves State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) performance in both one-class and multi-class anomaly detection tasks, thus redefining overfitting as a powerful strategy rather than a limitation.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised models for natural language, vision, and protein sequences have inspired the development of large genomic DNA language models (DNALMs). These models aim to learn generalizable representations of diverse DNA elements, potentially enabling various genomic prediction, interpretation and design tasks. Despite their potential, existing benchmarks do not adequately assess the capabilities of DNALMs on key downstream applications involving an important class of non-coding DNA elements critical for regulating gene activity. In this study, we introduce DART-Eval, a suite of representative benchmarks specifically focused on regulatory DNA to evaluate model performance across zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned scenarios against contemporary ab initio models as baselines. Our benchmarks target biologically meaningful downstream tasks such as functional sequence feature discovery, predicting cell-type specific regulatory activity, and counterfactual prediction of the impacts of genetic variants. We find that current DNALMs exhibit inconsistent performance and do not offer compelling gains over alternative baseline models for most tasks, while requiring significantly more computational resources. We discuss potentially promising modeling, data curation, and evaluation strategies for the next generation of DNALMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/DART-Eval.

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless communication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio resource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks. Building on CSI-BERT, we introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. We also introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based temporal embedding module to mitigate permutation invariance issues in time-series CSI data. This significantly improves the CSI classification performance of the original CSI-BERT model. Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent findings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be pruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an opportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall rooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We demonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads to diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their effectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger gradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier layers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique that combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN applies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring more uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the network--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training. Extensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that Mix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more balanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the overall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models pre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep layers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current LLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without increasing model size.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative modeling, demonstrating exceptional capability in capturing target data distributions from large datasets. However, fine-tuning these massive models for specific downstream tasks, constraints, and human preferences remains a critical challenge. While recent advances have leveraged reinforcement learning algorithms to tackle this problem, much of the progress has been empirical, with limited theoretical understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose a stochastic control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. Building on denoising diffusion probabilistic models as the pre-trained reference dynamics, our approach integrates linear dynamics control with Kullback-Leibler regularization. We establish the well-posedness and regularity of the stochastic control problem and develop a policy iteration algorithm (PI-FT) for numerical solution. We show that PI-FT achieves global convergence at a linear rate. Unlike existing work that assumes regularities throughout training, we prove that the control and value sequences generated by the algorithm maintain the regularity. Additionally, we explore extensions of our framework to parametric settings and continuous-time formulations.

Abstract: Current evaluations of defenses against prompt attacks in large language model (LLM) applications often overlook two critical factors: the dynamic nature of adversarial behavior and the usability penalties imposed on legitimate users by restrictive defenses. We propose D-SEC (Dynamic Security Utility Threat Model), which explicitly separates attackers from legitimate users, models multi-step interactions, and expresses the security-utility in an optimizable form. We further address the shortcomings in existing evaluations by introducing Gandalf, a crowd-sourced, gamified red-teaming platform designed to generate realistic, adaptive attack. Using Gandalf, we collect and release a dataset of 279k prompt attacks. Complemented by benign user data, our analysis reveals the interplay between security and utility, showing that defenses integrated in the LLM (e.g., system prompts) can degrade usability even without blocking requests. We demonstrate that restricted application domains, defense-in-depth, and adaptive defenses are effective strategies for building secure and useful LLM applications.

Abstract: We present a novel framework combining Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and estimate their unknown parameters. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, our method achieves robust and accurate solutions across diverse scenarios. Bayesian training is implemented through variational inference, allowing for comprehensive uncertainty quantification for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. This ensures reliable predictions and parameter estimates even in noisy conditions or when some of the physical equations governing the problem are missing. The framework demonstrates its efficacy in solving forward and inverse problems, including the 1D unsteady heat equation and 2D reaction-diffusion equations, as well as regression tasks with sparse, noisy observations. This approach provides a computationally efficient and generalizable method for addressing uncertainty quantification in PDE surrogate modeling.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in financial auditing, and effective detection requires large volumes of data from multiple organizations. However, journal entry data is highly sensitive, making it infeasible to share them directly across audit firms. To address this challenge, journal entry anomaly detection methods based on model share-type federated learning (FL) have been proposed. These methods require multiple rounds of communication with external servers to exchange model parameters, which necessitates connecting devices storing confidential data to external networks -- a practice not recommended for sensitive data such as journal entries. To overcome these limitations, a novel anomaly detection framework based on data collaboration (DC) analysis, a non-model share-type FL approach, is proposed. The method first transforms raw journal entry data into secure intermediate representations via dimensionality reduction and then constructs a collaboration representation used to train an anomaly detection autoencoder. Notably, the approach does not require raw data to be exposed or devices to be connected to external networks, and the entire process needs only a single round of communication. The proposed method was evaluated on both synthetic and real-world journal entry data collected from eight healthcare organizations. The experimental results demonstrated that the framework not only outperforms the baseline trained on individual data but also achieves higher detection performance than model-sharing FL methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, particularly under non-i.i.d. settings that simulate practical audit environments. This study addresses the critical need to integrate organizational knowledge while preserving data confidentiality, contributing to the development of practical intelligent auditing systems.

Abstract: We introduce distributional dynamic programming (DP) methods for optimizing statistical functionals of the return distribution, with standard reinforcement learning as a special case. Previous distributional DP methods could optimize the same class of expected utilities as classic DP. To go beyond, we combine distributional DP with stock augmentation, a technique previously introduced for classic DP in the context of risk-sensitive RL, where the MDP state is augmented with a statistic of the rewards obtained since the first time step. We find that a number of recently studied problems can be formulated as stock-augmented return distribution optimization, and we show that we can use distributional DP to solve them. We analyze distributional value and policy iteration, with bounds and a study of what objectives these distributional DP methods can or cannot optimize. We describe a number of applications outlining how to use distributional DP to solve different stock-augmented return distribution optimization problems, for example maximizing conditional value-at-risk, and homeostatic regulation. To highlight the practical potential of stock-augmented return distribution optimization and distributional DP, we introduce an agent that combines DQN and the core ideas of distributional DP, and empirically evaluate it for solving instances of the applications discussed.

Abstract: For intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles to operate safely and efficiently, they must reliably predict the future motion and trajectory of surrounding agents within complex traffic environments. At the same time, the motion of these agents is inherently uncertain, making accurate prediction difficult. In this paper, we propose \textbf{TrajFlow}, a generative framework for estimating the occupancy density of dynamic agents. Our framework utilizes a causal encoder to extract semantically meaningful embeddings of the observed trajectory, as well as a normalizing flow to decode these embeddings and determine the most likely future location of an agent at some time point in the future. Our formulation differs from existing approaches because we model the marginal distribution of spatial locations instead of the joint distribution of unobserved trajectories. The advantages of a marginal formulation are numerous. First, we demonstrate that the marginal formulation produces higher accuracy on challenging trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Second, the marginal formulation allows for fully continuous sampling of future locations. Finally, marginal densities are better suited for downstream tasks as they allow for the computation of per-agent motion trajectories and occupancy grids, the two most commonly used representations for motion forecasting. We present a novel architecture based entirely on neural differential equations as an implementation of this framework and provide ablations to demonstrate the advantages of a continuous implementation over a more traditional discrete neural network based approach. The code is available at https://github.com/UMN-Choi-Lab/TrajFlow.

Abstract: Among generative neural models, flow matching techniques stand out for their simple applicability and good scaling properties. Here, velocity fields of curves connecting a simple latent and a target distribution are learned. Then the corresponding ordinary differential equation can be used to sample from a target distribution, starting in samples from the latent one. This paper reviews from a mathematical point of view different techniques to learn the velocity fields of absolutely continuous curves in the Wasserstein geometry. We show how the velocity fields can be characterized and learned via i) transport plans (couplings) between latent and target distributions, ii) Markov kernels and iii) stochastic processes, where the latter two include the coupling approach, but are in general broader. Besides this main goal, we show how flow matching can be used for solving Bayesian inverse problems, where the definition of conditional Wasserstein distances plays a central role. Finally, we briefly address continuous normalizing flows and score matching techniques, which approach the learning of velocity fields of curves from other directions.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is crucial for numerous real-world applications including weather prediction and financial market modeling. While temporal-domain methods remain prevalent, frequency-domain approaches can effectively capture multi-scale periodic patterns, reduce sequence dependencies, and naturally denoise signals. However, existing approaches typically train model components for all frequencies under a unified training objective, often leading to mismatched learning speeds: high-frequency components converge faster and risk overfitting, while low-frequency components underfit due to insufficient training time. To deal with this challenge, we propose BEAT (Balanced frEquency Adaptive Tuning), a novel framework that dynamically monitors the training status for each frequency and adaptively adjusts their gradient updates. By recognizing convergence, overfitting, or underfitting for each frequency, BEAT dynamically reallocates learning priorities, moderating gradients for rapid learners and increasing those for slower ones, alleviating the tension between competing objectives across frequencies and synchronizing the overall learning process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that BEAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, reward signal for agents are exceedingly sparse, making it challenging to learn an effective reward function for reward shaping. To address this issue, the proposed approach in this paper performs reward shaping not only by utilizing non-zero-reward transitions but also by employing the \emph{Semi-Supervised Learning} (SSL) technique combined with a novel data augmentation to learn trajectory space representations from the majority of transitions, {i.e}., zero-reward transitions, thereby improving the efficacy of reward shaping. Experimental results in Atari and robotic manipulation demonstrate that our method outperforms supervised-based approaches in reward inference, leading to higher agent scores. Notably, in more sparse-reward environments, our method achieves up to twice the peak scores compared to supervised baselines. The proposed double entropy data augmentation enhances performance, showcasing a 15.8\% increase in best score over other augmentation methods

Abstract: Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees of DP-SGD are incompatible with time series specific tasks like forecasting, since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small, unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series, and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised training of sequence models. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that amplification by structured subsampling enables the training of forecasting models with strong formal privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that elicit harmful behavior. While existing studies predominantly focus on attack methods that require technical expertise, two critical questions remain underexplored: (1) Are jailbroken responses truly useful in enabling average users to carry out harmful actions? (2) Do safety vulnerabilities exist in more common, simple human-LLM interactions? In this paper, we demonstrate that LLM responses most effectively facilitate harmful actions when they are both actionable and informative--two attributes easily elicited in multi-step, multilingual interactions. Using this insight, we propose HarmScore, a jailbreak metric that measures how effectively an LLM response enables harmful actions, and Speak Easy, a simple multi-step, multilingual attack framework. Notably, by incorporating Speak Easy into direct request and jailbreak baselines, we see an average absolute increase of 0.319 in Attack Success Rate and 0.426 in HarmScore in both open-source and proprietary LLMs across four safety benchmarks. Our work reveals a critical yet often overlooked vulnerability: Malicious users can easily exploit common interaction patterns for harmful intentions.

Abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) with mixed modalities enables unimodal and multimodal clients to collaboratively train models while ensuring clients' privacy. As a representative sample of local data, prototypes offer an approach with low resource consumption and no reliance on prior knowledge for MFL with mixed modalities. However, existing prototype-based MFL methods assume unified labels across clients and identical tasks per client, which is impractical in MFL with mixed modalities. In this work, we propose an Adaptive prototype-based Multimodal Federated Learning (AproMFL) framework for mixed modalities to address the aforementioned issues. Our AproMFL transfers knowledge through adaptively-constructed prototypes without unified labels. Clients adaptively select prototype construction methods in line with labels; server converts client prototypes into unified multimodal prototypes and cluster them to form global prototypes. To address model aggregation issues in task heterogeneity, we develop a client relationship graph-based scheme to dynamically adjust aggregation weights. Furthermore, we propose a global prototype knowledge transfer loss and a global model knowledge transfer loss to enable the transfer of global knowledge to local knowledge. Experimental results show that AproMFL outperforms four baselines on three highly heterogeneous datasets ($\alpha=0.1$) and two heterogeneous tasks, with the optimal results in accuracy and recall being 0.42%~6.09% and 1.6%~3.89% higher than those of FedIoT (FedAvg-based MFL), respectively.

Abstract: We study the task of learning Generalized Linear models (GLMs) in the agnostic model under the Gaussian distribution. We give the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a constant-factor approximation for \textit{any} monotone Lipschitz activation. Prior constant-factor GLM learners succeed for a substantially smaller class of activations. Our work resolves a well-known open problem, by developing a robust counterpart to the classical GLMtron algorithm (Kakade et al., 2011). Our robust learner applies more generally, encompassing all monotone activations with bounded $(2+\zeta)$-moments, for any fixed $\zeta>0$ -- a condition that is essentially necessary. To obtain our results, we leverage a novel data augmentation technique with decreasing Gaussian noise injection and prove a number of structural results that may be useful in other settings.

Abstract: Latent generative models have emerged as a leading approach for high-quality image synthesis. These models rely on an autoencoder to compress images into a latent space, followed by a generative model to learn the latent distribution. We identify that existing autoencoders lack equivariance to semantic-preserving transformations like scaling and rotation, resulting in complex latent spaces that hinder generative performance. To address this, we propose EQ-VAE, a simple regularization approach that enforces equivariance in the latent space, reducing its complexity without degrading reconstruction quality. By finetuning pre-trained autoencoders with EQ-VAE, we enhance the performance of several state-of-the-art generative models, including DiT, SiT, REPA and MaskGIT, achieving a 7 speedup on DiT-XL/2 with only five epochs of SD-VAE fine-tuning. EQ-VAE is compatible with both continuous and discrete autoencoders, thus offering a versatile enhancement for a wide range of latent generative models.

<title>Raising the Bar in Graph OOD Generalization: Invariant Learning Beyond Explicit Environment Modeling</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization has emerged as a critical challenge in graph learning, as real-world graph data often exhibit diverse and shifting environments that traditional models fail to generalize across. A promising solution to address this issue is graph invariant learning (GIL), which aims to learn invariant representations by disentangling label-correlated invariant subgraphs from environment-specific subgraphs. However, existing GIL methods face two major challenges: (1) the difficulty of capturing and modeling diverse environments in graph data, and (2) the semantic cliff, where invariant subgraphs from different classes are difficult to distinguish, leading to poor class separability and increased misclassifications. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Multi-Prototype Hyperspherical Invariant Learning (MPHIL), which introduces two key innovations: (1) hyperspherical invariant representation extraction, enabling robust and highly discriminative hyperspherical invariant feature extraction, and (2) multi-prototype hyperspherical classification, which employs class prototypes as intermediate variables to eliminate the need for explicit environment modeling in GIL and mitigate the semantic cliff issue. Derived from the theoretical framework of GIL, we introduce two novel objective functions: the invariant prototype matching loss to ensure samples are matched to the correct class prototypes, and the prototype separation loss to increase the distinction between prototypes of different classes in the hyperspherical space. Extensive experiments on 11 OOD generalization benchmark datasets demonstrate that MPHIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods across graph data from various domains and with different distribution shifts.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the risk-sensitive cost criterion with exponentiated costs for Markov decision processes and develop a model-free policy gradient algorithm in this setting. Unlike additive cost criteria such as average or discounted cost, the risk-sensitive cost criterion is less studied due to the complexity resulting from the multiplicative structure of the resulting Bellman equation. We develop an actor-critic algorithm with function approximation in this setting and provide its asymptotic convergence analysis. We also show the results of numerical experiments that demonstrate the superiority in performance of our algorithm over other recent algorithms in the literature.

<title>Type 1 Diabetes Management using GLIMMER: Glucose Level Indicator Model with Modified Error Rate</title>

Abstract: Managing Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) demands constant vigilance as individuals strive to regulate their blood glucose levels to avoid the harmful effects of dysglycemia, including both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Despite the development of advanced technologies such as automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, achieving optimal glycemic control remains challenging. AID systems combine continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with data from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), offering potential benefits in reducing glucose variability and increasing time-in-range. However, these systems still frequently fail to prevent dysglycemia, partly due to limitations in their prediction algorithms, which lack the accuracy needed to avert abnormal glucose events. This shortcoming highlights the need for more advanced glucose forecasting methods. To address this need, we introduce GLIMMER, Glucose Level Indicator Model with Modified Error Rate, a machine learning-based model for predicting blood glucose levels. GLIMMER classifies glucose values into normal and abnormal ranges and employs a novel custom loss function that prioritizes accuracy in dysglycemic regions, where patient safety is most critical. To evaluate GLIMMER's effectiveness for T1D management, we used both a publicly available dataset and a newly collected dataset involving 25 individuals with T1D. In forecasting glucose levels for the next hour, GLIMMER achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.97 (+/-3.77) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.83 (+/-2.09) mg/dL. These results represent a 23% improvement in RMSE and a 31% improvement in MAE compared to the best previously reported models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate data analysis through executable code generation. Yet, data science tasks often admit multiple statistically valid solutions, e.g. different modeling strategies, making it critical to understand the reasoning behind analyses, not just their outcomes. While manual review of LLM-generated code can help ensure statistical soundness, it is labor-intensive and requires expertise. A more scalable approach is to evaluate the underlying workflows - the logical plans guiding code generation. However, it remains unclear how to assess whether a LLM-generated workflow supports reproducible implementations.
  To address this, we present $\it{AIRepr}$, an $\it{A}$nalyst - $\it{I}$nspector framework for automatically evaluating and improving the $\it{Repr}$oducibility of LLM-generated data analysis workflows. Our framework is grounded in statistical principles and supports scalable, automated assessment. We introduce two novel reproducibility-enhancing prompting strategies and benchmark them against standard prompting across 15 analyst-inspector LLM pairs and 1,032 tasks from three public benchmarks. Our findings show that workflows with higher reproducibility also yield more accurate analyses, and that reproducibility-enhancing prompts substantially improve both metrics. This work provides a foundation for more transparent, reliable, and efficient human-AI collaboration in data science. Our code is publicly available.

<title>Causal Effect Estimation under Networked Interference without Networked Unconfoundedness Assumption</title>

Abstract: Estimating causal effects under networked interference from observational data is a crucial yet challenging problem. Most existing methods mainly rely on the networked unconfoundedness assumption, which guarantees the identification of networked effects. However, this assumption is often violated due to the latent confounders inherent in observational data, thereby hindering the identification of networked effects. To address this issue, we leverage the rich interaction patterns between units in networks, which provide valuable information for recovering these latent confounders. Building on this insight, we develop a confounder recovery framework that explicitly characterizes three categories of latent confounders in networked settings: those affecting only the unit, those affecting only the unit's neighbors, and those influencing both. Based on this framework, we design a networked effect estimator using identifiable representation learning techniques. From a theoretical standpoint, we prove the identifiability of all three types of latent confounders and, by leveraging the recovered confounders, establish a formal identification result for networked effects. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous language and vision tasks. While the self-attention mechanism, a core component of transformers, has proven capable of handling complex data patterns, it has been observed that the representational capacity of the attention matrix degrades significantly across transformer layers, thereby hurting its overall performance. In this work, we leverage the connection between self-attention computations and low-pass non-local means (NLM) smoothing filters and propose the Twicing Attention, a novel attention mechanism that uses kernel twicing procedure in nonparametric regression to alleviate the low-pass behavior of associated NLM smoothing with compelling theoretical guarantees and enhanced adversarial robustness. This approach enables the extraction and reuse of meaningful information retained in the residuals following the imperfect smoothing operation at each layer. Our proposed method offers two key advantages over standard self-attention: 1) a provably slower decay of representational capacity and 2) improved robustness and accuracy across various data modalities and tasks. We empirically demonstrate the performance gains of our model over baseline transformers on multiple tasks and benchmarks, including image classification and language modeling, on both clean and corrupted data.

<title>SEAL: Semantic Aware Image Watermarking</title>

Abstract: Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs. However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection.
  In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.

Abstract: Spurious correlations, unstable statistical shortcuts a model can exploit, are expected to degrade performance out-of-distribution (OOD). However, across many popular OOD generalization benchmarks, vanilla empirical risk minimization (ERM) often achieves the highest OOD accuracy. Moreover, gains in in-distribution accuracy generally improve OOD accuracy, a phenomenon termed accuracy on the line, which contradicts the expected harm of spurious correlations. We show that these observations are an artifact of misspecified OOD datasets that do not include shifts in spurious correlations that harm OOD generalization, the setting they are meant to evaluate. Consequently, current practice evaluates "robustness" without truly stressing the spurious signals we seek to eliminate; our work pinpoints when that happens and how to fix it. Contributions. (i) We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for a distribution shift to reveal a model's reliance on spurious features; when these conditions hold, "accuracy on the line" disappears. (ii) We audit leading OOD datasets and find that most still display accuracy on the line, suggesting they are misspecified for evaluating robustness to spurious correlations. (iii) We catalog the few well-specified datasets and summarize generalizable design principles, such as identifying datasets of natural interventions (e.g., a pandemic), to guide future well-specified benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding how urban socio-demographic and environmental factors relate with health is essential for public health and urban planning. However, traditional statistical methods struggle with nonlinear effects, while machine learning models often fail to capture geographical (nearby areas being more similar) and topological (unequal connectivity between places) effects in an interpretable way. To address this, we propose MedGNN, a spatio-topologically explicit framework that constructs a 2-hop spatial graph, integrating positional and locational node embeddings with urban characteristics in a graph neural network. Applied to MEDSAT, a comprehensive dataset covering over 150 environmental and socio-demographic factors and six prescription outcomes (depression, anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and opioids) across 4,835 Greater London neighborhoods, MedGNN improved predictions by over 25% on average compared to baseline methods. Using depression prescriptions as a case study, we analyzed graph embeddings via geographical principal component analysis, identifying findings that: align with prior research (e.g., higher antidepressant prescriptions among older and White populations), contribute to ongoing debates (e.g., greenery linked to higher and NO2 to lower prescriptions), and warrant further study (e.g., canopy evaporation correlated with fewer prescriptions). These results demonstrate MedGNN's potential, and more broadly, of carefully applied machine learning, to advance transdisciplinary public health research.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in multi-task scenarios. We propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI), a simple yet effective approach that freezes the projection matrices $A$ as random projections and sparsifies the matrices $B$ using task-specific masks. This design substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong task performance. Moreover, LoRI minimizes cross-task interference in adapter merging by leveraging the orthogonality between adapter subspaces, and supports continual learning by using sparsity to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks demonstrate that LoRI outperforms full fine-tuning and existing PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference. Code is available at: https://github.com/juzhengz/LoRI

<title>Between Linear and Sinusoidal: Rethinking the Time Encoder in Dynamic Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: Dynamic graph learning is essential for applications involving temporal networks and requires effective modeling of temporal relationships. Seminal attention-based models like TGAT and DyGFormer rely on sinusoidal time encoders to capture temporal dependencies between edge events. Prior work justified sinusoidal encodings because their inner products depend on the time spans between events, which are crucial features for modeling inter-event relations. However, sinusoidal encodings inherently lose temporal information due to their many-to-one nature and therefore require high dimensions. In this paper, we rigorously study a simpler alternative: the linear time encoder, which avoids temporal information loss caused by sinusoidal functions and reduces the need for high-dimensional time encoders. We show that the self-attention mechanism can effectively learn to compute time spans between events from linear time encodings and extract relevant temporal patterns. Through extensive experiments on six dynamic graph datasets, we demonstrate that the linear time encoder improves the performance of TGAT and DyGFormer in most cases. Moreover, the linear time encoder can lead to significant savings in model parameters with minimal performance loss. For example, compared to a 100-dimensional sinusoidal time encoder, TGAT with a 2-dimensional linear time encoder saves 43% of parameters and achieves higher average precision on five datasets. While both encoders can be used simultaneously, our study highlights the often-overlooked advantages of linear time features in modern dynamic graph models. These findings can positively impact the design choices of various dynamic graph learning architectures and eventually benefit temporal network applications such as recommender systems, communication networks, and traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are widely used in machine learning for tasks such as clustering, classification, image reconstruction, and generative modeling. A key challenge in working with GMMs is defining a computationally efficient and geometrically meaningful metric. The mixture Wasserstein (MW) distance adapts the Wasserstein metric to GMMs and has been applied in various domains, including domain adaptation, dataset comparison, and reinforcement learning. However, its high computational cost -- arising from repeated Wasserstein distance computations involving matrix square root estimations and an expensive linear program -- limits its scalability to high-dimensional and large-scale problems. To address this, we propose multiple novel slicing-based approximations to the MW distance that significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving key optimal transport properties. From a theoretical viewpoint, we establish several weak and strong equivalences between the introduced metrics, and show the relations to the original MW distance and the well-established sliced Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating computational efficiency and applications in clustering, perceptual image comparison, and GMM minimization

Abstract: Aligning large language models with multiple human expectations and values is crucial for ensuring that they adequately serve a variety of user needs. To this end, offline multiobjective alignment algorithms such as the Rewards-in-Context algorithm have shown strong performance and efficiency. However, inappropriate preference representations and training with imbalanced reward scores limit the performance of such algorithms. In this work, we introduce ParetoHqD that addresses the above issues by representing human preferences as preference directions in the objective space and regarding data near the Pareto front as ''high-quality'' data. For each preference, ParetoHqD follows a two-stage supervised fine-tuning process, where each stage uses an individual Pareto high-quality training set that best matches its preference direction. The experimental results have demonstrated the superiority of ParetoHqD over five baselines on two multiobjective alignment tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how concept-based models (CMs) respond to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. CMs are interpretable neural architectures that first predict a set of high-level concepts (e.g., stripes, black) and then predict a task label from those concepts. In particular, we study the impact of concept interventions (i.e., operations where a human expert corrects a CM's mispredicted concepts at test time) on CMs' task predictions when inputs are OOD. Our analysis reveals a weakness in current state-of-the-art CMs, which we term leakage poisoning, that prevents them from properly improving their accuracy when intervened on for OOD inputs. To address this, we introduce MixCEM, a new CM that learns to dynamically exploit leaked information missing from its concepts only when this information is in-distribution. Our results across tasks with and without complete sets of concept annotations demonstrate that MixCEMs outperform strong baselines by significantly improving their accuracy for both in-distribution and OOD samples in the presence and absence of concept interventions.

<title>On learning functions over biological sequence space: relating Gaussian process priors, regularization, and gauge fixing</title>

Abstract: Mappings from biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) to quantitative measures of sequence functionality play an important role in contemporary biology. We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires ``gauge-fixing,'' i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized ``weight space'' where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in ``function space,'' i.e.~the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges and characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers. Finally, we derive the posterior distribution of a broad class of sequence-to-function statistics, including gauge-fixed weights and multiple systems for expressing higher-order epistatic coefficients. We show that such distributions can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick.

<title>LZ Penalty: An information-theoretic repetition penalty for autoregressive language models</title>

Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.

Abstract: Scaling deep neural network (DNN) training to more devices can reduce time-to-solution. However, it is impractical for users with limited computing resources. FOSI, as a hybrid order optimizer, converges faster than conventional optimizers by taking advantage of both gradient information and curvature information when updating the DNN model. Therefore, it provides a new chance for accelerating DNN training in the resource-constrained setting. In this paper, we explore its distributed design, namely DHO$_2$, including distributed calculation of curvature information and model update with partial curvature information to accelerate DNN training with a low memory burden. To further reduce the training time, we design a novel strategy to parallelize the calculation of curvature information and the model update on different devices. Experimentally, our distributed design can achieve an approximate linear reduction of memory burden on each device with the increase of the device number. Meanwhile, it achieves $1.4\times\sim2.1\times$ speedup in the total training time compared with other distributed designs based on conventional first- and second-order optimizers.

Abstract: Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate total electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, thus enabling more effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack of explainability. This paper introduces the first prompt-based NILM framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning. We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features, contextual information, and representative time-series examples through extensive case studies. Extensive experiments on the REDD and UK-DALE datasets show that LLMs guided solely by prompts deliver only basic NILM capabilities, with performance that lags behind traditional deep-learning models in complex scenarios. However, the experiments also demonstrate strong generalization across different houses and even regions by simply adapting the injected appliance features. It also provides clear, human-readable explanations for the inferred appliance states. Our findings define the capability boundaries of using prompt-only LLMs for NILM tasks. Their strengths in generalization and explainability present a promising new direction for the field.

Abstract: This paper quantitatively investigates the crash severity of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) with spatially localized machine learning and macroscopic measures of the urban built environment. Extending beyond the microscopic effects of individual infrastructure elements, we focus on the city-scale land use and behavioral patterns, while addressing spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. We implemented a spatially localized machine learning technique called Geographical Random Forest (GRF) on the California AV collision dataset. Analyzing multiple urban measures, including points of interest, building footprint, and land use, we built a GRF model and visualized it as a crash severity risk map of San Francisco. This paper presents three findings. First, spatially localized machine learning outperformed regular machine learning in predicting AV crash severity. The bias-variance tradeoff was evident as we adjusted the localization weight hyperparameter. Second, land use was the most important predictor, compared to intersections, building footprints, public transit stops, and Points Of Interest (POIs). Third, AV crashes were more likely to result in low-severity incidents in city center areas with greater diversity and commercial activities, than in residential neighborhoods. Residential land use is likely associated with higher severity due to human behavior and less restrictive environments. Counterintuitively, residential areas were associated with higher crash severity, compared to more complex areas such as commercial and mixed-use areas. When robotaxi operators train their AV systems, it is recommended to: (1) consider where their fleet operates and make localized algorithms for their perception system, and (2) design safety measures specific to residential neighborhoods, such as slower driving speeds and more alert sensors.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to establish best practices for leveraging their capabilities beyond traditional natural language tasks. In this paper, a novel cross-domain knowledge transfer framework is proposed to enhance the performance of LLMs in time series forecasting -- a task of increasing relevance in fields such as energy systems, finance, and healthcare. The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information. Results show that knowledge-informed forecasting significantly outperforms the uninformed baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization. These findings highlight the potential of knowledge transfer strategies to bridge the gap between LLMs and domain-specific forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline while only increasing training time by 4.9\% and testing time by 6.5\%. We also experimentally demonstrate that GEM can improve the step-wise success rate by 9.40\% by requesting assistance from the cloud model when encountering OOD samples. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones. The codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/GEM-OODforGUIagents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at mathematical reasoning and logical problem-solving. The current popular training paradigms primarily use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the models' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are respective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to mode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training schemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization across different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to these challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human reasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training framework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the two throughout optimization. SASR uses SFT for initial warm-up to establish basic reasoning skills, and then uses an adaptive dynamic adjustment algorithm based on gradient norm and divergence relative to the original distribution to seamlessly integrate SFT with the online RL method GRPO. By monitoring the training status of LLMs and adjusting the training process in sequence, SASR ensures a smooth transition between training schemes, maintaining core reasoning abilities while exploring different paths. Experimental results demonstrate that SASR outperforms SFT, RL, and static hybrid training methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress in many applications in recent years. However, chemical MLLMs that can handle cross-modal understanding and generation remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose ChemMLLM, a unified chemical multimodal large language model for molecule understanding and generation. Also, we design five multimodal tasks across text, molecular SMILES strings, and image, and curate the datasets. We benchmark ChemMLLM against a range of general leading MLLMs and Chemical LLMs on these tasks. Experimental results show that ChemMLLM achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks. For example, in molecule image optimization task, ChemMLLM outperforms the best baseline (GPT-4o) by 116.75\% (4.27 vs 1.97 property improvement). The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bbsbz/ChemMLLM.git.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a subset from a large action space shared by a family of bandits, with the goal of achieving performance nearly matching that of using the full action space. We assume that similar actions tend to have related payoffs, modeled by a Gaussian process. To exploit this structure, we propose a simple epsilon-net algorithm to select a representative subset. We provide theoretical guarantees for its performance and compare it empirically to Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often need to incorporate external knowledge to solve theme-specific problems. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown its high promise, empowering LLMs to generate more qualified responses with retrieved external data and knowledge. However, most RAG methods retrieve relevant documents based on either sparse or dense retrieval methods or their combinations, which overlooks the essential, multi-dimensional, and structured semantic information present in documents. This structured information plays a critical role in finding concise yet highly relevant information for domain knowledge-intensive tasks, such as scientific question-answering (QA). In this work, we introduce a multi-dimensional (cube) structure, Hypercube, which can index and allocate documents in a pre-defined multi-dimensional space. Built on the hypercube, we further propose Hypercube-RAG, a novel RAG framework for precise and efficient retrieval. Given a query, Hypercube-RAG first decomposes it based on its entities, phrases, and topics along with pre-defined hypercube dimensions, and then retrieves relevant documents from cubes by aligning these decomposed components with corresponding dimensions. Experiments on three datasets across different domains demonstrate that our method improves response accuracy by 3.7% and retrieval accuracy by 5.3% over the strongest RAG baseline. It also boosts retrieval efficiency (speed) by one or two magnitudes faster than graph-based RAG. Notably, our Hypercube-RAG inherently offers explainability by revealing those underlying dimensions used for retrieval. The code and data are available at https://github.com/JimengShi/Hypercube-RAG.

Abstract: Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses can vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these treatment decisions are often irregularly sampled, where missing data frequencies may implicitly convey information about the patient's condition. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) based clinical decision support systems often ignore the missing patterns and distort them with coarse discretization and simple imputation. They are also predominantly model-free and largely depend on retrospective data, which could lead to insufficient exploration and bias by historical behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose medDreamer, a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for personalized treatment recommendation. medDreamer contains a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration module that simulates latent patient states from irregular data and a two-phase policy trained on a hybrid of real and imagined trajectories. This enables learning optimal policies that go beyond the sub-optimality of historical clinical decisions, while remaining close to real clinical data. We evaluate medDreamer on both sepsis and mechanical ventilation treatment tasks using two large-scale Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that medDreamer significantly outperforms model-free and model-based baselines in both clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics.

In recent years, Machine Learning has revolutionized diagnostic practices by creating classification models capable of identifying diseases. However, these classification problems often suffer from significant class imbalances, which can inhibit the effectiveness of traditional models. Therefore, the interest in Quantum models has arisen, driven by the captivating promise of overcoming the limitations of the classical counterpart thanks to their ability to express complex patterns by mapping data in a higher-dimensional computational space.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating high-quality tabular data, but they carry privacy risks by reproducing exact training samples. While prior work focuses on dataset-level augmentation to reduce memorization, little is known about which individual samples contribute most. We present the first data-centric study of memorization dynamics in tabular diffusion models. We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how many generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance ratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of memorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately to leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we divide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their training-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and monitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized slightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training. Based on these insights, we propose DynamicCut, a two-stage, model-agnostic mitigation method: (a) rank samples by epoch-wise intensity, (b) prune a tunable top fraction, and (c) retrain on the filtered dataset. Across multiple tabular datasets and models, DynamicCut reduces memorization with minimal impact on data diversity and downstream performance. It also complements augmentation-based defenses. Furthermore, DynamicCut enables cross-model transferability: high-ranked samples identified from one model (e.g., a diffusion model) are also effective for reducing memorization when removed from others, such as GANs and VAEs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven time embedding method for modeling long-range seasonal dependencies in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. The proposed approach employs Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to extract temporal modes directly from observed data, eliminating the need for explicit timestamps or hand-crafted time features. These temporal modes serve as time representations that can be seamlessly integrated into deep spatiotemporal forecasting models. Unlike conventional embeddings such as time-of-day indicators or sinusoidal functions, our method captures complex multi-scale periodicity through spectral analysis of spatiotemporal data. Extensive experiments on urban mobility, highway traffic, and climate datasets demonstrate that the DMD-based embedding consistently improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy, reduces residual correlation, and enhances temporal generalization. The method is lightweight, model-agnostic, and compatible with any architecture that incorporates time covariates.

Abstract: Continual memory augmentation lets computer-using agents (CUAs) learn from prior interactions, but unvetted memories can encode domain-inappropriate or unsafe heuristics--spurious rules that drift from user intent and safety constraints. We introduce VerificAgent, a scalable oversight framework that treats persistent memory as an explicit alignment surface. VerificAgent combines (1) an expert-curated seed of domain knowledge, (2) iterative, trajectory-based memory growth during training, and (3) a post-hoc human fact-checking pass to sanitize accumulated memories before deployment. Evaluated on OSWorld productivity tasks and additional adversarial stress tests, VerificAgent improves task reliability, reduces hallucination-induced failures, and preserves interpretable, auditable guidance--without additional model fine-tuning. By letting humans correct high-impact errors once, the verified memory acts as a frozen safety contract that future agent actions must satisfy. Our results suggest that domain-scoped, human-verified memory offers a scalable oversight mechanism for CUAs, complementing broader alignment strategies by limiting silent policy drift and anchoring agent behavior to the norms and safety constraints of the target domain.

Abstract: Continual learning under adversarial conditions remains an open problem, as existing methods often compromise either robustness, scalability, or both. We propose a novel framework that integrates Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) with a hypernetwork-based architecture to enable certifiably robust continual learning across sequential tasks. Our method, SHIELD, generates task-specific model parameters via a shared hypernetwork conditioned solely on compact task embeddings, eliminating the need for replay buffers or full model copies and enabling efficient over time. To further enhance robustness, we introduce Interval MixUp, a novel training strategy that blends virtual examples represented as $\ell_{\infty}$ balls centered around MixUp points. Leveraging interval arithmetic, this technique guarantees certified robustness while mitigating the wrapping effect, resulting in smoother decision boundaries. We evaluate SHIELD under strong white-box adversarial attacks, including PGD and AutoAttack, across multiple benchmarks. It consistently outperforms existing robust continual learning methods, achieving state-of-the-art average accuracy while maintaining both scalability and certification. These results represent a significant step toward practical and theoretically grounded continual learning in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Neural networks excel as function approximators, but their complexity often obscures what kinds of functions they learn. We introduce the linearity score $\lambda(f)$, a simple and interpretable diagnostic that quantifies how well a regression network's output can be mimicked by a linear model. Defined as the $R^2$ value between the network's predictions and those of a trained linear surrogate, $\lambda(f)$ measures linear decodability: the extent to which the network's behavior aligns with a structurally simple model. We evaluate this framework on both synthetic ($y = x \cdot \sin(x) + \epsilon$) and real-world datasets (Medical Insurance, Concrete, California Housing), using dataset-specific networks and surrogates. Our findings show that high $\lambda(f)$ scores reliably indicate alignment with the network's outputs -- but do not guarantee accuracy with respect to the ground truth. These results highlight the risk of using surrogate fidelity as a proxy for model understanding -- especially in high-stakes regression tasks.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Abstract: This study investigates zero-shot forecasting capabilities of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for macroeconomic indicators. We apply TSFMs to forecasting economic indicators under univariate conditions, bypassing the need for train bespoke econometric models using and extensive training datasets. Our experiments were conducted on a case study dataset, without additional customisation. We rigorously back-tested three state-of-the-art TSFMs (Chronos, TimeGPT and Moirai) under data-scarce conditions and structural breaks. Our results demonstrate that appropriately engineered TSFMs can internalise rich economic dynamics, accommodate regime shifts, and deliver well-behaved uncertainty estimates out of the box, while matching state-of-the-art multivariate models on this domain. Our findings suggest that, without any fine-tuning, TSFMs can match or exceed classical models during stable economic conditions. However, they are vulnerable to degradation in performances during periods of rapid shocks. The findings offer guidance to practitioners on when zero-shot deployments are viable for macroeconomic monitoring and strategic planning.

Abstract: Muon, a recently proposed optimizer that leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters, has demonstrated strong empirical performance, indicating its potential as a successor to standard optimizers such as AdamW. This paper presents theoretical analysis to support its practical success. We provide convergence proofs for Muon across four practical settings, systematically examining its behavior with and without the inclusion of Nesterov momentum and weight decay. Our analysis covers the standard configuration using both, thereby elucidating its real-world performance. We then demonstrate that the addition of weight decay yields strictly tighter theoretical bounds and clarify the interplay between the weight decay coefficient and the learning rate. Finally, we derive the critical batch size for Muon that minimizes the computational cost of training. Our analysis identifies the hyperparameters governing this value, and our experiments validate the corresponding theoretical findings.

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification; however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift. Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models, including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android, Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in malware detection.

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models have been widely adopted for False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) detection in smart grids due to their ability to capture unstructured and sparse features. However, the increasing system scale and data dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens, particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.

<title>Clustered Federated Learning for Generalizable FDIA Detection in Smart Grids with Heterogeneous Data</title>

Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication (client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.

Abstract: Normalizing flows have emerged as a powerful brand of generative models, as they not only allow for efficient sampling of complicated target distributions but also deliver density estimation by construction. We propose here an in-depth comparison of coupling and autoregressive flows, both based on symmetric (affine) and non-symmetric (rational quadratic spline) bijectors, considering four different architectures: real-valued non-Volume preserving (RealNVP), masked autoregressive flow (MAF), coupling rational quadratic spline (C-RQS), and autoregressive rational quadratic spline (A-RQS). We focus on a set of multimodal target distributions of increasing dimensionality ranging from 4 to 400. The performances were compared by means of different test statistics for two-sample tests, built from known distance measures: the sliced Wasserstein distance, the dimension-averaged one-dimensional Kolmogorov--Smirnov test, and the Frobenius norm of the difference between correlation matrices. Furthermore, we included estimations of the variance of both the metrics and the trained models. Our results indicate that the A-RQS algorithm stands out both in terms of accuracy and training speed. Nonetheless, all the algorithms are generally able, without too much fine-tuning, to learn complicated distributions with limited training data and in a reasonable time of the order of hours on a Tesla A40 GPU. The only exception is the C-RQS, which takes significantly longer to train, does not always provide good accuracy, and becomes unstable for large dimensionalities. All algorithms were implemented using \textsc{TensorFlow2} and \textsc{TensorFlow Probability} and have been made available on \href{https://github.com/NF4HEP/NormalizingFlowsHD}{GitHub}.

Abstract: Small language models like T5 excel in generating high-quality text for data-to-text tasks, offering adaptability and cost-efficiency compared to Large Language Models (LLMs). However, they frequently miss keywords, which is considered one of the most severe and common errors in this task. In this work, we explore the potential of using feedback systems to enhance semantic fidelity in smaller language models for data-to-text generation tasks, through our Verification and Correction Prompting (VCP) approach. In the inference stage, our approach involves a multi-step process, including generation, verification, and regeneration stages. During the verification stage, we implement a simple rule to check for the presence of every keyword in the prediction. Recognizing that this rule can be inaccurate, we have developed a carefully designed training procedure, which enabling the model to incorporate feedback from the error-correcting prompt effectively, despite its potential inaccuracies. The VCP approach effectively reduces the Semantic Error Rate (SER) while maintaining the text's quality.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel multimodal food recognition framework that effectively combines visual and textual modalities to enhance classification accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach employs a dynamic multimodal fusion strategy that adaptively integrates features from unimodal visual inputs and complementary textual metadata. This fusion mechanism is designed to maximize the use of informative content, while mitigating the adverse impact of missing or inconsistent modality data. The framework was rigorously evaluated on the UPMC Food-101 dataset and achieved unimodal classification accuracies of 73.60% for images and 88.84% for text. When both modalities were fused, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.84%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrated the robustness, adaptability, and computational efficiency of the proposed settings, highlighting its practical applicability to real-world multimodal food-recognition scenarios.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, deep learning enabled motion prediction is a popular topic. A critical gap in traditional motion prediction methodologies lies in ensuring equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations and maintaining invariant interaction relationships. This research introduces a groundbreaking solution by employing EqMotion, a theoretically geometric equivariant and interaction invariant motion prediction model for particles and humans, plus integrating agent-equivariant high-definition (HD) map features for context aware motion prediction in autonomous driving. The use of EqMotion as backbone marks a significant departure from existing methods by rigorously ensuring motion equivariance and interaction invariance. Equivariance here implies that an output motion must be equally transformed under the same Euclidean transformation as an input motion, while interaction invariance preserves the manner in which agents interact despite transformations. These properties make the network robust to arbitrary Euclidean transformations and contribute to more accurate prediction. In addition, we introduce an equivariant method to process the HD map to enrich the spatial understanding of the network while preserving the overall network equivariance property. By applying these technologies, our model is able to achieve high prediction accuracy while maintain a lightweight design and efficient data utilization.

Abstract: Forecasting vehicular motions in autonomous driving requires a deep understanding of agent interactions and the preservation of motion equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations. Traditional models often lack the sophistication needed to handle the intricate dynamics inherent to autonomous vehicles and the interaction relationships among agents in the scene. As a result, these models have a lower model capacity, which then leads to higher prediction errors and lower training efficiency. In our research, we employ EqMotion, a leading equivariant particle, and human prediction model that also accounts for invariant agent interactions, for the task of multi-agent vehicle motion forecasting. In addition, we use a multi-modal prediction mechanism to account for multiple possible future paths in a probabilistic manner. By leveraging EqMotion, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with fewer parameters (1.2 million) and a significantly reduced training time (less than 2 hours).

Abstract: Transformer models represent the cutting edge of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and excel in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, processing these models demands significant computational resources and results in a substantial memory footprint. While In-memory Computing (IMC)offers promise for accelerating Vector-Matrix Multiplications(VMMs) with high computational parallelism and minimal data movement, employing it for other crucial DNN operators remains a formidable task. This challenge is exacerbated by the extensive use of complex activation functions, Softmax, and data-dependent matrix multiplications (DMMuls) within Transformer models. To address this challenge, we introduce a Reconfigurable Analog Computing Engine (RACE) by enhancing Analog Content Addressable Memories (ACAMs) to support broader operations. Based on the RACE, we propose the RACE-IT accelerator (meaning RACE for In-memory Transformers) to enable efficient analog-domain execution of all core operations of Transformer models. Given the flexibility of our proposed RACE in supporting arbitrary computations, RACE-IT is well-suited for adapting to emerging and non-traditional DNN architectures without requiring hardware modifications. We compare RACE-IT with various accelerators. Results show that RACE-IT increases performance by 453x and 15x, and reduces energy by 354x and 122x over the state-of-the-art GPUs and existing Transformer-specific IMC accelerators, respectively.

Abstract: This study investigates the robustness of graph embedding methods for community detection in the face of network perturbations, specifically edge deletions. Graph embedding techniques, which represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors, are widely used for various graph machine learning tasks due to their ability to capture structural properties of networks effectively. However, the impact of perturbations on the performance of these methods remains relatively understudied. The research considers state-of-the-art graph embedding methods from two families: matrix factorization (e.g., LE, LLE, HOPE, M-NMF) and random walk-based (e.g., DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec). Through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks, the study reveals varying degrees of robustness within each family of graph embedding methods. The robustness is found to be influenced by factors such as network size, initial community partition strength, and the type of perturbation. Notably, node2vec and LLE consistently demonstrate higher robustness for community detection across different scenarios, including networks with degree and community size heterogeneity. These findings highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate graph embedding method based on the specific characteristics of the network and the task at hand, particularly in scenarios where robustness to perturbations is crucial.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is essential for their applications. Recently, decoding-time alignment has emerged as an effective plug-and-play technique that avoids fine-tuning model parameters. This approach retains the general utility of pretrained LLMs but often suffers from significant inefficiencies during decoding, primarily due to wasted token generation and excessive reward evaluations. To address these challenges, we introduce Cascade Reward Sampling (CARDS) to resolve both efficiency bottlenecks in decoding-time alignment. Specifically, we develop a segment-level rejection sampling algorithm that minimizes redundant computations of both LLMs and reward models (RMs). Central to CARDS is an uncertainty-based segmentation mechanism, which ensures the accuracy of RMs evaluations on incomplete segments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of reward scores on segments to elucidate the improved alignment performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CARDS significantly improves decoding efficiency, alignment quality, and general utility compared to existing decoding-time alignment methods, achieving approximately a 70% reduction in decoding time and over 90% win-ties in utility and safety benchmarks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios, enabling the identification of unknown samples or objects. A prominent approach to enhance OOD detection performance involves leveraging auxiliary datasets for training. Recent efforts have explored using generative models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to synthesize outlier data in the pixel space. However, synthesizing OOD data in the pixel space can lead to reduced robustness due to over-generation. To address this challenge, we propose Outlier-Aware Learning (OAL), a novel framework that generates synthetic OOD training data within the latent space, taking a further step to study how to utilize Stable Diffusion for developing a latent-based outlier synthesis approach. This improvement facilitates network training with fewer outliers and less computational cost. Besides, to regularize the model's decision boundary, we develop a mutual information-based contrastive learning module (MICL) that amplifies the distinction between In-Distribution (ID) and collected OOD data. Moreover, we develop a knowledge distillation module to prevent the degradation of ID classification accuracy when training with OOD data. The superior performance of our method on several benchmark datasets demonstrates its efficiency and effectiveness. Source code is available in https://github.com/HengGao12/OAL.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have significantly improved prediction accuracy in various applications. However, ensuring the calibration of probabilistic predictions remains a significant challenge. Despite efforts to enhance model calibration, the rigorous statistical evaluation of model calibration remains less explored. In this work, we develop confidence intervals the $\ell_2$ Expected Calibration Error (ECE). We consider top-1-to-$k$ calibration, which includes both the popular notion of confidence calibration as well as full calibration. For a debiased estimator of the ECE, we show asymptotic normality, but with different convergence rates and asymptotic variances for calibrated and miscalibrated models. We develop methods to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the ECE, accounting for this behavior as well as non-negativity. Our theoretical findings are supported through extensive experiments, showing that our methods produce valid confidence intervals with shorter lengths compared to those obtained by resampling-based methods.

Abstract: It has been widely substantiated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible and vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing studies mainly focus on performing attacks by corrupting targeted objects (physical attack) or images (digital attack), which is intuitively acceptable and understandable in terms of the attack's effectiveness. In contrast, our focus lies in conducting background adversarial attacks in both digital and physical domains, without causing any disruptions to the targeted objects themselves. Specifically, an effective background adversarial attack framework is proposed to attack anything, by which the attack efficacy generalizes well between diverse objects, models, and tasks. Technically, we approach the background adversarial attack as an iterative optimization problem, analogous to the process of DNN learning. Besides, we offer a theoretical demonstration of its convergence under a set of mild but sufficient conditions. To strengthen the attack efficacy and transferability, we propose a new ensemble strategy tailored for adversarial perturbations and introduce an improved smooth constraint for the seamless connection of integrated perturbations. We conduct comprehensive and rigorous experiments in both digital and physical domains across various objects, models, and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of attacking anything of the proposed method. The findings of this research substantiate the significant discrepancy between human and machine vision on the value of background variations, which play a far more critical role than previously recognized, necessitating a reevaluation of the robustness and reliability of DNNs.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a cost-effective and efficient tool to support neurologists in the detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual feature engineering or data transformation. While such techniques may provide benefits when working with small-scale datasets, they often lead to information loss and distortion when applied to large-scale data, ultimately limiting model performance. Moreover, the limited subject scale and demographic diversity of datasets used in prior studies hinder comprehensive evaluation of model robustness and generalizability, thus restricting their applicability in real-world clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose ADformer, a novel multi-granularity spatial-temporal transformer designed to capture both temporal and spatial features from raw EEG signals, enabling effective end-to-end representation learning. Our model introduces multi-granularity embedding strategies across both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging a two-stage intra-inter granularity self-attention mechanism to learn both local patterns within each granularity and global dependencies across granularities. We evaluate ADformer on 4 large-scale datasets comprising a total of 1,713 subjects, representing one of the largest corpora for EEG-based AD detection to date, under a cross-validated, subject-independent setting. Experimental results demonstrate that ADformer consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving subject-level F1 scores of 92.82%, 89.83%, 67.99%, and 83.98% on the 4 datasets, respectively, in distinguishing AD from healthy control (HC) subjects.

Abstract: Softmax mixture models (SMMs) are discrete $K$-mixtures introduced to model the probability of choosing an attribute $x_j \in \RR^L$ from $p$ candidates, in heterogeneous populations. They have been known as mixed multinomial logits in the econometrics literature, and are gaining traction in the LLM literature, where single softmax models are routinely used in the final layer of a neural network. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the EM algorithm for SMMs in high dimensions. Its population-level theoretical analysis forms the basis for proving (i) local identifiability, in SSMs with generic features and, further, via a stochastic argument, (ii) full identifiability in SSMs with random features, when $p$ is large enough. These are the first results in this direction for SSMs with $L > 1$. The population-level EM analysis characterizes the initialization radius for algorithmic convergence. This also guides the construction of warm starts of the sample level EM. Under suitable initialization, the EM algorithm is shown to recover the mixture atoms of the SSM at near-parametric rate. We provide two main directions for warm start construction, both based on a new method for estimating the moments of the mixing measure underlying an SSM with random design. First, we construct a method of moments (MoM) estimator of the mixture parameters, and provide its first theoretical analysis. While MoM can enjoy parametric rates of convergence, and thus can serve as a warm-start, the estimator's quality degrades exponentially in $K$. Our recommendation, when $K$ is not small, is to run the EM algorithm several times with random initializations. We again make use of the novel latent moments estimation method to estimate the $K$-dimensional subspace of the mixture atoms. Sampling from this subspace reduces substantially the number of required draws.

Abstract: Code completion is essential in software development, helping developers by predicting code snippets based on context. Among completion tasks, Method Body Completion (MBC) is particularly challenging as it involves generating complete method bodies based on their signatures and context. This task becomes significantly harder in large repositories, where method bodies must integrate repositoryspecific elements such as custom APIs, inter-module dependencies, and project-specific conventions. In this paper, we introduce RAMBO, a novel RAG-based approach for repository-level MBC. Instead of retrieving similar method bodies, RAMBO identifies essential repository-specific elements, such as classes, methods, and variables/fields, and their relevant usages. By incorporating these elements and their relevant usages into the code generation process, RAMBO ensures more accurate and contextually relevant method bodies. Our experimental results with leading code LLMs across 40 Java projects show that RAMBO significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art repository-level MBC approaches, with the improvements of up to 46% in BLEU, 57% in CodeBLEU, 36% in Compilation Rate, and up to 3X in Exact Match. Notably, RAMBO surpassed RepoCoder Oracle method by up to 12% in Exact Match, setting a new benchmark for repository-level MBC.

However, system errors or occlusions can result in missing markers, the manual cleaning of which can be time-consuming. This has sparked interest in machine learning-based solutions for missing marker reconstruction in the academic community. Most academic papers utilize a simplistic mean square error as the main metric. In this paper, we show that this metric does not correlate with subjective perception of the fill quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate a set of better-correlated metrics that can drive progress in the field.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results.

<title>Adaptive Hyper-Graph Convolution Network for Skeleton-based Human Action Recognition with Virtual Connections</title>

Abstract: The shared topology of human skeletons motivated the recent investigation of graph convolutional network (GCN) solutions for action recognition. However, most of the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighboring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. Although some studies have attempted to utilize hyper-graphs to represent the topology, they rely on a fixed construction strategy, which limits their adaptivity in uncovering the intricate latent relationships within the action. In this paper, we address this oversight and explore the merits of an adaptive hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises the hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, PaLM, and Llama has significantly transformed natural language processing, showcasing remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language. However, a fundamental bottleneck persists: these models often struggle with tasks requiring complex, multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical problem-solving. This deficiency stems from the critical scarcity of large-scale, high-quality, domain-specific datasets necessary for cultivating sophisticated reasoning abilities. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel and scalable paradigm that harnesses frontier LLMs (GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates, which in turn synthesize a virtually infinite stream of high-quality problems and solutions. Using this paradigm, we create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a foundational dataset of over 7 million synthetically generated grade school math problems. Each problem is accompanied by a programmatically verifiable solution, offering an unprecedented level of quality at scale. This resource not only resolves the data scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning but also provides a robust mechanism for model alignment through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Our approach elevates data augmentation by employing GPT-4 for meta-template creation, guaranteeing diverse and complex problem structures. By providing a scalable solution to the data and verification bottleneck, TDG and TemplateGSM pave the way for a new generation of LLMs with powerful, reliable reasoning skills. The code and data are available at https://github.com/iiis-ai/TemplateMath.

<title>Core Context Aware Transformers for Long Context Language Modeling</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in extensive tasks primarily attributed to self-attention mechanism, which requires a token to consider all preceding tokens as its context to compute attention. However, when the context length L becomes very large (e.g., 128K), the amount of potentially redundant information in the context tends to increase. The redundant context not only hampers the modeling representation performance but also incurs unnecessary computational and storage overhead. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play Core Context Aware (CCA) Attention for efficient long-context modeling, comprising two complementary modules: 1) Globality-aware pooling module groups input tokens and dynamically compresses each group into one core token based on their significance. In this way, our method automatically focuses and strengthens core context while diminishing redundancy during the learning process, leading to effective long-term dependency modeling. 2) Locality-preserving module incorporates neighboring tokens to preserve local context for detailed representation. Notably, our CCA-Attention is able to replace the self-attention module in existing LLMs with minimal fine-tuning cost. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of our method in both long-context modeling and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Inspired by the Boltzmann kinetics, we propose a collision-based dynamics with a Monte Carlo solution algorithm that approximates the solution of the multi-marginal optimal transport problem via randomized pairwise swapping of sample indices. The computational complexity and memory usage of the proposed method scale linearly with the number of samples, making it highly attractive for high-dimensional settings. In several examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The ongoing revolution in language modeling has led to various novel applications, some of which rely on the emerging social abilities of large language models (LLMs). Already, many turn to the new cyber friends for advice during the pivotal moments of their lives and trust them with the deepest secrets, implying that accurate shaping of the LLM's personality is paramount. To this end, state-of-the-art approaches exploit a vast variety of training data, and prompt the model to adopt a particular personality. We ask (i) if personality-prompted models behave (i.e., make decisions when presented with a social situation) in line with the ascribed personality (ii) if their behavior can be finely controlled. We use classic psychological experiments, the Milgram experiment and the Ultimatum Game, as social interaction testbeds and apply personality prompting to open- and closed-source LLMs from 4 different vendors. Our experiments reveal failure modes of the prompt-based modulation of the models' behavior that are shared across all models tested and persist under prompt perturbations. These findings challenge the optimistic sentiment toward personality prompting generally held in the community.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has achieved remarkable success by integrating information from various modalities, achieving superior performance in tasks like recognition and retrieval compared to uni-modal approaches. However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: Weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and Strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research. Our work provides a foundation for advancing robust and adaptable multi-modal models, enabling them to handle unseen modalities in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Balancing content fidelity and artistic style is a pivotal challenge in image generation. While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they often struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes both. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to maintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify sensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers that correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs only to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over style and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained inputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization techniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the quality of generated visual content.

<title>MixNet: A Runtime Reconfigurable Optical-Electrical Fabric for Distributed Mixture-of-Experts Training</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models outperform conventional models by selectively activating different subnets, named \emph{experts}, on a per-token basis. This gated computation generates dynamic communications that cannot be determined beforehand, challenging the existing GPU interconnects that remain \emph{static} during the distributed training process. In this paper, we advocate for a first-of-its-kind system, called mFabric, that unlocks topology reconfiguration \emph{during} distributed MoE training. Towards this vision, we first perform a production measurement study and show that the MoE dynamic communication pattern has \emph{strong locality}, alleviating the requirement of global reconfiguration. Based on this, we design and implement a \emph{regionally reconfigurable high-bandwidth domain} on top of existing electrical interconnects using optical circuit switching (OCS), achieving scalability while maintaining rapid adaptability. We have built a fully functional mFabric prototype with commodity hardware and a customized collective communication runtime that trains state-of-the-art MoE models with \emph{in-training} topology reconfiguration across 32 A100 GPUs. Large-scale packet-level simulations show that mFabric delivers comparable performance as the non-blocking fat-tree fabric while boosting the training cost efficiency (e.g., performance per dollar) of four representative MoE models by 1.2$\times$--1.5$\times$ and 1.9$\times$--2.3$\times$ at 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps link bandwidths, respectively.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable performance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical challenge: providing feedback for tasks where human evaluation is difficult or where LLMs potentially outperform humans. In such scenarios, leveraging the critique ability of LLMs themselves - identifying and correcting flaws - shows considerable promise. This paper explores enhancing critique abilities of LLMs, noting that current approaches rely on human annotations or more powerful models, leaving the challenge of improving critique abilities without external supervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving CRITic), a framework that trains LLMs with self-generated data to evolve their critique abilities. To address the low quality of naively generated data, we propose a contrastive-critic approach that uses reference solutions during data synthesis to enhance the model's understanding of key concepts, and incorporates a self-validation scheme to ensure data quality. The final trained model operates without any reference solutions at inference time. Implemented with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, a leading LLM, SCRIT demonstrates consistent improvements across a wide range of benchmarks spanning both mathematical and scientific reasoning: achieving a 10.0\% relative gain in critique-correction accuracy and a 19.0\% relative improvement in error identification F1-score. Our analysis reveals that SCRIT's performance scales positively with data and model size and enables continuous improvement through multi-round iterations.

<title>Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform of Generalized $q$-ary Functions</title>

arXiv:2501.12365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the Fourier transform of a $q$-ary function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which maps $q$-ary sequences to real numbers, is an important problem in mathematics with wide-ranging applications in biology, signal processing, and machine learning. Previous studies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms. However, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more general space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each $\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. Herein, we develop GFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier transform of $f$ with a sample complexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity of $O(Sn \log N)$, and a failure probability that approaches zero as $N=\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \rightarrow \infty$ with $S = N^\delta$ for some $0 \leq \delta < 1$. We show that a noise-robust version of GFast computes the transform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of $O(Sn^2 \log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized $q$-ary functions $8\times$ faster using $16\times$ fewer samples on synthetic experiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and protein fitness models using up to $13\times$ fewer samples compared to existing Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of the models as $q$-ary functions.

<title>Correctness Assessment of Code Generated by Large Language Models Using Internal Representations</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the correctness of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a significant challenge in AI-driven software development. Existing approaches predominantly rely on black-box (closed-box) approaches that evaluate correctness post-generation, failing to utilize the rich insights embedded in the LLMs' internal states during code generation. In this paper, we introduce OPENIA, a novel white-box (open-box) framework that leverages these internal representations to assess the correctness of LLM-generated code. OPENIA systematically analyzes the intermediate states of representative open-source LLMs specialized for code, including DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, and MagicCoder, across diverse code generation benchmarks. Our empirical analysis reveals that these internal representations encode latent information, which strongly correlates with the correctness of the generated code. Building on these insights, OPENIA uses a white-box/open-box approach to make informed predictions about code correctness, offering significant advantages in adaptability and robustness over traditional classification-based methods and zero-shot approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that OPENIA consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Scores with up to a 2X improvement in standalone code generation and a 46% enhancement in repository-specific scenarios. By unlocking the potential of in-process signals, OPENIA paves the way for more proactive and efficient quality assurance mechanisms in LLM-assisted code generation.

Abstract: Inverse Constraint Learning (ICL) is the problem of inferring constraints from safe (i.e., constraint-satisfying) demonstrations. The hope is that these inferred constraints can then be used downstream to search for safe policies for new tasks and, potentially, under different dynamics. Our paper explores the question of what mathematical entity ICL recovers. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that both in theory and in practice, ICL recovers the set of states where failure is inevitable, rather than the set of states where failure has already happened. In the language of safe control, this means we recover a backwards reachable tube (BRT) rather than a failure set. In contrast to the failure set, the BRT depends on the dynamics of the data collection system. We discuss the implications of the dynamics-conditionedness of the recovered constraint on both the sample-efficiency of policy search and the transferability of learned constraints.

arXiv:2501.16600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how perturbation does and does not improve the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm in solving imperfect-information extensive-form games under sampling, where payoffs are estimated from sampled trajectories. While optimistic algorithms are effective under full feedback, they often become unstable in the presence of sampling noise. Payoff perturbation offers a promising alternative for stabilizing learning and achieving \textit{last-iterate convergence}. We present a unified framework for \textit{Perturbed FTRL} algorithms and study two variants: PFTRL-KL (standard KL divergence) and PFTRL-RKL (Reverse KL divergence), the latter featuring an estimator with both unbiasedness and conditional zero variance. While PFTRL-KL generally achieves equivalent or better performance across benchmark games, PFTRL-RKL consistently outperforms it in Leduc poker, whose structure is more asymmetric than the other games in a sense. Given the modest advantage of PFTRL-RKL, we design the second experiment to isolate the effect of conditional zero variance, showing that the variance-reduction property of RKL improve last-iterate performance.

Abstract: How can we identify groups of primate individuals which could be conjectured to drive social structure? To address this question, one of us has collected a time series of data for social interactions between chimpanzees. Here we use a network representation, leading to the task of combining these data into a time series of a single weighted network per time stamp, where different proximities should be given different weights reflecting their relative importance. We optimize these proximity-type weights in a principled way, using an innovative loss function which rewards structural consistency for consecutive time steps. The approach is empirically validated by carefully designed synthetic data. Using statistical tests, we provide a way of identifying groups of individuals that stay related for a significant length of time. Applying the approach to the chimpanzee data set, we detect cliques in the animal social network time series, which can be validated by real-world intuition from prior research and qualitative observations by chimpanzee experts.

arXiv:2502.06096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental but largely unexplored challenge in sequential changepoint analysis: conducting inference following a detected change. We develop a very general framework to construct confidence sets for the unknown changepoint using only the data observed up to a data-dependent stopping time at which an arbitrary sequential detection algorithm declares a change. Our framework is nonparametric, making no assumption on the composite post-change class, the observation space, or the sequential detection procedure used, and is nonasymptotically valid. We also extend it to handle composite pre-change classes under a suitable assumption, and also derive confidence sets for the change magnitude in parametric settings. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the produced sets have reasonable size, and slightly conservative coverage. In summary, we present the first general method for sequential changepoint localization, which is theoretically sound and broadly applicable in practice.

Abstract: In this work, we argue that large language models (LLMs), though trained to predict only the next token, exhibit emergent planning behaviors: $\textbf{their hidden representations encode future outputs beyond the next token}$. Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structure attributes}$ (e.g., response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (e.g., character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavior attributes}$ (e.g., answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggest potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is of paramount importance in the development of high-performance, specialized artificial intelligence (AI) models, ranging from well-established machine learning (ML) solutions to the deep learning (DL) domain and the field of spiking neural networks (SNNs). The latter introduce further complexity due to the neuronal computational units and their additional hyperparameters, whose inadequate setting can dramatically impact the final model performance. At the cost of possible reduced generalization capabilities, the most suitable strategy to fully disclose the power of SNNs is to adopt an application-oriented approach and perform extensive HPO experiments. To facilitate these operations, automatic pipelines are fundamental, and their configuration is crucial. In this document, the Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) toolkit is used as reference framework to present one such solution, with a use case example providing evidence of the corresponding results. In addition, a summary of published works employing the presented pipeline is reported as possible source of insights into application-oriented HPO experiments for SNN prototyping.

Abstract: The rampdown phase of a tokamak pulse is difficult to simulate and often exacerbates multiple plasma instabilities. To reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to combine physics with data-driven models, developing a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. The NSSM efficiently learns dynamics from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in a reactor-relevant high-performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid instability limits. High-performance experiments at TCV show statistically significant improvements in relevant metrics. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty and demonstrates the relevance of SciML for fusion experiments.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models for creative tasks, their outputs often lack diversity. Common solutions, such as sampling at higher temperatures, can compromise the quality of the results. Dealing with this trade-off is still an open challenge in designing AI systems for creativity. Drawing on information theory, we propose a context-based score to quantitatively evaluate value and originality. This score incentivizes accuracy and adherence to the request while fostering divergence from the learned distribution. We show that our score can be used as a reward in a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune large language models for maximum performance. We validate our strategy through experiments considering a variety of creative tasks, such as poetry generation and math problem solving, demonstrating that it enhances the value and originality of the generated solutions.

Abstract: Despite their growing capabilities, language models still frequently reproduce content from their training data, generate repetitive text, and favor common grammatical patterns and vocabulary. A possible cause is the decoding strategy: the most common strategies either consider only the most probable tokens, which reduces output diversity, or increase the likelihood of unlikely tokens, compromising output accuracy and correctness. In this paper, we propose DiffSampling, a new decoding method that leverages a mathematical analysis of the token probability distribution to ensure the generation of contextually appropriate text. In particular, the difference between consecutive, sorted probabilities can be used to truncate incorrect tokens. In addition, we also propose two variations of the proposed method that aim to correct the subtle inconsistencies of common sampling strategies. Experiments involving four different text-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach consistently performs at least on par with the existing methods it builds upon in terms of quality, while potentially improving output diversity.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), the demand for robust instruction-following capabilities in code generation tasks has grown significantly. Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.

<title>Semi-Parametric Batched Global Multi-Armed Bandits with Covariates</title>

Abstract: The multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework is a widely used approach for sequential decision-making, where a decision-maker selects an arm in each round with the goal of maximizing long-term rewards. Moreover, in many practical applications, such as personalized medicine and recommendation systems, feedback is provided in batches, contextual information is available at the time of decision-making, and rewards from different arms are related rather than independent. We propose a novel semi-parametric framework for batched bandits with covariates and a shared parameter across arms, leveraging the single-index regression (SIR) model to capture relationships between arm rewards while balancing interpretability and flexibility. Our algorithm, Batched single-Index Dynamic binning and Successive arm elimination (BIDS), employs a batched successive arm elimination strategy with a dynamic binning mechanism guided by the single-index direction. We consider two settings: one where a pilot direction is available and another where the direction is estimated from data, deriving theoretical regret bounds for both cases. When a pilot direction is available with sufficient accuracy, our approach achieves minimax-optimal rates (with $d = 1$) for nonparametric batched bandits, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm compared to the nonparametric batched bandit method introduced by \cite{jiang2024batched}.

<title>Refined Policy Distillation: From VLA Generalists to RL Experts</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities in real-world experiments. However, their success rates are often not on par with expert policies, and they require fine-tuning when the setup changes. In this work, we introduce Refined Policy Distillation (RPD), a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy refinement method that bridges this performance gap through a combination of on-policy RL with behavioral cloning. The core idea of RPD is to distill and refine VLAs into compact, high-performing expert policies by guiding the student policy during RL exploration using the actions of a teacher VLA, resulting in increased sample efficiency and faster convergence. We complement our method by fine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill3 to evaluate RPD in simulation. While this is a key requirement for applying RL, it also yields new insights beyond existing studies on VLA performance in real-world settings. Our experimental results across various manipulation tasks show that RPD enables the RL student to learn expert policies that outperform the VLA teacher in both dense and sparse reward settings, while also achieving faster convergence than the RL baseline. Our approach is even robust to changes in camera perspective and can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve. Our code, dataset, VLA checkpoints, and videos are available at https://refined-policy-distillation.github.io

Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.

Abstract: Quadrupeds have gained rapid advancement in their capability of traversing across complex terrains. The adoption of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), transformers and various knowledge transfer techniques can greatly reduce the sim-to-real gap. However, the classical teacher-student framework commonly used in existing locomotion policies requires a pre-trained teacher and leverages the privilege information to guide the student policy. With the implementation of large-scale models in robotics controllers, especially transformers-based ones, this knowledge distillation technique starts to show its weakness in efficiency, due to the requirement of multiple supervised stages. In this paper, we propose Unified Locomotion Transformer (ULT), a new transformer-based framework to unify the processes of knowledge transfer and policy optimization in a single network while still taking advantage of privilege information. The policies are optimized with reinforcement learning, next state-action prediction, and action imitation, all in just one training stage, to achieve zero-shot deployment. Evaluation results demonstrate that with ULT, optimal teacher and student policies can be obtained at the same time, greatly easing the difficulty in knowledge transfer, even with complex transformer-based models.

arXiv:2503.12937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the cost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these models, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the operational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active learning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different sets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility, interpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a graph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the gene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes a criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network to enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is optimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active learning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of acceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation experiments while achieving comparable test error.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied AI intensifies the demand for diverse manipulation demonstrations. However, high costs associated with data collection often result in insufficient data coverage across all scenarios, which limits the performance of the models. It is observed that the spatial reasoning phase (SRP) in large workspace dominates the failure cases. Fortunately, this data can be collected with low cost, underscoring the potential of leveraging inexpensive data to improve model performance. In this paper, we introduce the RoboTron-Craft, a stage-divided and cost-effective pipeline for realistic manipulation generation. Base on this, the RoboTron-Platter method is introduced, a framework that decouples training trajectories into distinct task stages and leverages abundant easily collectible SRP data to enhance VLA model's generalization. Through analysis we demonstrate that sub-task-specific training with additional SRP data with proper proportion can act as a performance catalyst for robot manipulation, maximizing the utilization of costly physical interaction phase (PIP) data. Experiments show that through introducing large proportion of cost-effective SRP trajectories into a limited set of PIP data, we can achieve a maximum improvement of 41\% on success rate in zero-shot scenes, while with the ability to transfer manipulation skill to novel targets.

Abstract: Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) has gained significant attention due to its high-speed data transmission and throughput. Optical wireless channels are often assumed to be flat, but we evaluate frequency selective channels to consider high data rate optical wireless or very dispersive environments. To address this for optical scenarios, this paper presents a robust channel estimation framework with low-complexity to mitigate frequency-selective effects, then to improve system reliability and performance. This channel estimation framework contains a neural network that can estimate general optical wireless channels without prior channel information about the environment. Based on this estimate and the corresponding delay spread, one of several candidate offline-trained neural networks will be activated to predict this channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method has improved and robust normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional estimation methods while maintaining computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of neural network solutions in enhancing the performance of OWC systems under indoor channel conditions.

Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on combinatorial optimization tasks demonstrate that integrating RL with evolutionary search accelerates the discovery of superior algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies for algorithm design.

<title>Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs</title>

Abstract: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.

Abstract: Generative AI has recently had a profound impact on various fields, including daily life, research, and education. To explore its efficient utilization in data-driven materials science, we organized a hackathon -- AIMHack2024 -- in July 2024. In this hackathon, researchers from fields such as materials science, information science, bioinformatics, and condensed matter physics worked together to explore how generative AI can facilitate research and education. Based on the results of the hackathon, this paper presents topics related to (1) conducting AI-assisted software trials, (2) building AI tutors for software, and (3) developing GUI applications for software. While generative AI continues to evolve rapidly, this paper provides an early record of its application in data-driven materials science and highlights strategies for integrating AI into research and education.

Abstract: We study structured Stackelberg games, in which both players (the leader and the follower) observe contextual information about the state of the world at time of play. The leader plays against one of a finite number of followers, but the follower's type is not known until after the game has ended. Importantly, we assume a fixed relationship between the contextual information and the follower's type, thereby allowing the leader to leverage this additional structure when deciding her strategy. Under this setting, we find that standard learning theoretic measures of complexity do not characterize the difficulty of the leader's learning task. Instead, we introduce a new notion of dimension, the Stackelberg-Littlestone dimension, which we show characterizes the instance-optimal regret of the leader in the online setting. Based on this, we also provide a provably optimal learning algorithm. We extend our results to the distributional setting, where we use two new notions of dimension, the $\gamma$-Stackelberg-Natarajan dimension and $\gamma$-Stackelberg-Graph dimension. We prove that these control the sample complexity lower and upper bounds respectively, and we design a simple, improper algorithm that achieves the upper bound.

<title>Assumptions to Evidence: Evaluating Security Practices Adoption and Their Impact on Outcomes in the npm Ecosystem</title>

Abstract: Practitioners often struggle with the overwhelming number of security practices outlined in cybersecurity frameworks for risk mitigation. Given the limited budget, time, and resources, practitioners want to prioritize the adoption of security practices based on empirical evidence. The goal of this study is to assist practitioners and policymakers in making informed decisions on which security practices to adopt by evaluating the relationship between software security practices adoption and security outcome metrics. To do this, we analyzed the adoption of security practices and their impact on security outcome metrics across 145K npm packages. We selected the OpenSSF Scorecard metrics to automatically measure the adoption of security practices in npm GitHub repositories. We also investigated project-level security outcome metrics: the number of open vulnerabilities (Vul_Count)), mean time to remediate (MTTR) vulnerabilities in dependencies, and mean time to update (MTTU) dependencies. We conducted regression and causal analysis using 11 Scorecard metrics and the aggregated Scorecard score (computed by aggregating individual security practice scores) as predictors and Vul_Count), MTTR, and MTTU as target variables. Our findings reveal that aggregated adoption of security practices is associated with 5.2 fewer vulnerabilities, 216.8 days faster MTTR, and 52.3 days faster MTTU. Repository characteristics have an impact on security practice effectiveness: repositories with high security practice adoptions, especially those that are mature, actively maintained, large in size, have many contributors, few dependencies, and high download volumes, tend to exhibit better outcomes compared to smaller or inactive repositories.

arXiv:2505.01059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width.
  Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.

arXiv:2505.02508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are popular tools for generating new data samples, using a forward process that adds noise to data and a reverse process to denoise and produce samples. However, when the data distribution consists of n points, empirical diffusion models tend to reproduce existing data points, a phenomenon known as the memorization effect. Current literature often addresses this with complex machine learning techniques. This work shows that the memorization issue can be solved simply by applying an inertia update at the end of the empirical diffusion simulation. Our inertial diffusion model requires only the empirical score function and no additional training. We demonstrate that the distribution of samples from this model approximates the true data distribution on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension $d$, within a Wasserstein-1 distance of order $O(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}})$. This bound significantly shrinks the Wasserstein distance between the population and empirical distributions, confirming that the inertial diffusion model produces new and diverse samples. Remarkably, this estimate is independent of the ambient space dimension, as no further training is needed. Our analysis shows that the inertial diffusion samples resemble Gaussian kernel density estimations on the manifold, revealing a novel connection between diffusion models and manifold learning.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.

<title>Do MLLMs Capture How Interfaces Guide User Behavior? A Benchmark for Multimodal UI/UX Design Understanding</title>

Abstract: User interface (UI) design goes beyond visuals, guiding user behavior and overall user experience (UX). Strategically crafted interfaces, for example, can boost sign-ups and drive business sales, underscoring the shift toward UI/UX as a unified design concept. While recent studies have explored UI quality evaluation using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they largely focus on surface-level features, overlooking behavior-oriented aspects. To fill this gap, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a novel benchmark for assessing models' multimodal understanding of UI/UX design. It includes 300 diverse real-world UI image pairs, each consisting of two design variants A/B-tested at scale by actual companies, where one was empirically validated to steer more user actions than the other. Each pair is accompanied one or more of 684 expert-curated rationales that capture key factors behind each winning design's effectiveness, spanning diverse cognitive dimensions of UX. Our benchmark supports two core tasks: (1) selecting the more effective UI/UX design by predicting the A/B test verified winner and (2) assessing how well a model, given the winner, can explain its effectiveness in alignment with expert reasoning. Experiments across several MLLMs show that current models exhibit limited nuanced reasoning about UI/UX design and its behavioral impact. We believe our work will foster research in UI/UX understanding and enable broader applications such as behavior-aware interface optimization.

Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their coordinate along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial coordinates from dual-focal-plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization precision of 40 nanometers-six times better than traditional single-focal-plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.

<title>PolarGrad: A Class of Matrix-Gradient Optimizers from a Unifying Preconditioning Perspective</title>

Abstract: The ever-growing scale of deep learning models and datasets underscores the critical importance of efficient optimization methods. While preconditioned gradient methods such as Adam and AdamW are the de facto optimizers for training neural networks and large language models, structure-aware preconditioned optimizers like Shampoo and Muon, which utilize the matrix structure of gradients, have demonstrated promising evidence of faster convergence. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework for analyzing "matrix-aware" preconditioned methods, which not only sheds light on the effectiveness of Muon and related optimizers but also leads to a class of new structure-aware preconditioned methods. A key contribution of this framework is its precise distinction between preconditioning strategies that treat neural network weights as vectors (addressing curvature anisotropy) versus those that consider their matrix structure (addressing gradient anisotropy). This perspective provides new insights into several empirical phenomena in language model pre-training, including Adam's training instabilities, Muon's accelerated convergence, and the necessity of learning rate warmup for Adam. Building upon this framework, we introduce PolarGrad, a new class of preconditioned optimization methods based on the polar decomposition of matrix-valued gradients. As a special instance, PolarGrad includes Muon with updates scaled by the nuclear norm of the gradients. We provide numerical implementations of these methods, leveraging efficient numerical polar decomposition algorithms for enhanced convergence. Our extensive evaluations across diverse matrix optimization problems and language model pre-training tasks demonstrate that PolarGrad outperforms both Adam and Muon.

<title>Learning to Incentivize in Repeated Principal-Agent Problems with Adversarial Agent Arrivals</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23124</link>

arXiv:2505.23124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight. Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously in each round.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize AI research, there is a growing interest in building large-scale brain foundation models to advance neuroscience. While most existing brain foundation models are pre-trained on time-series signals or connectome features, we propose a novel graph-based pre-training paradigm for constructing a brain graph foundation model. In this paper, we introduce the Brain Graph Foundation Model, termed BrainGFM, a unified framework that leverages graph contrastive learning and graph masked autoencoders for large-scale fMRI-based pre-training. BrainGFM is pre-trained on a diverse mixture of brain atlases with varying parcellations, significantly expanding the pre-training corpus and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across heterogeneous fMRI-derived brain representations. To support efficient and versatile downstream transfer, we integrate both graph prompts and language prompts into the model design, enabling BrainGFM to flexibly adapt to a wide range of atlases, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and task settings. Furthermore, we employ meta-learning to optimize the graph prompts, facilitating strong generalization to previously unseen disorders under both few-shot and zero-shot learning conditions via language-guided prompting. BrainGFM is pre-trained on 27 neuroimaging datasets spanning 25 common neurological and psychiatric disorders, encompassing 2 types of brain atlases (functional and anatomical) across 8 widely-used parcellations, and covering over 25,000 subjects, 60,000 fMRI scans, and a total of 400,000 graph samples aggregated across all atlases and parcellations.

<title>The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</title>

arXiv:2506.10872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to minimizing tail latency in queues.

arXiv:2506.14923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microearthquakes (MEQs) generated by subsurface fluid injection record the evolving stress state and permeability of reservoirs. Forecasting their full spatiotemporal evolution is therefore critical for applications such as enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), CO$_2$ sequestration and other geo-engineering applications. We present a transformer-based deep learning model that ingests hydraulic stimulation history and prior MEQ observations to forecast four key quantities: cumulative MEQ count, cumulative logarithmic seismic moment, and the 50th- and 95th-percentile extents ($P_{50}, P_{95}$) of the MEQ cloud. Applied to the EGS Collab Experiment 1 dataset, the model achieves $R^2 >0.98$ for the 1-second forecast horizon and $R^2 >0.88$ for the 15-second forecast horizon across all targets, and supplies uncertainty estimates through a learned standard deviation term. These accurate, uncertainty-quantified forecasts enable real-time inference of fracture propagation and permeability evolution, demonstrating the strong potential of deep-learning approaches to improve seismic-risk assessment and guide mitigation strategies in future fluid-injection operations.

Abstract: Linear mixed models (LMMs), which incorporate fixed and random effects, are key tools for analyzing heterogeneous data, such as in personalized medicine. Nowadays, this type of data is increasingly wide, sometimes containing thousands of candidate predictors, necessitating sparsity for prediction and interpretation. However, existing sparse learning methods for LMMs do not scale well beyond tens or hundreds of predictors, leaving a large gap compared with sparse methods for linear models, which ignore random effects. This paper closes the gap with a new $\ell_0$ regularized method for LMM subset selection that can run on datasets containing thousands of predictors in seconds to minutes. On the computational front, we develop a coordinate descent algorithm as our main workhorse and provide a guarantee of its convergence. We also develop a local search algorithm to help traverse the nonconvex optimization surface. Both algorithms readily extend to subset selection in generalized LMMs via a penalized quasi-likelihood approximation. On the statistical front, we provide a finite-sample bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the new method. We then demonstrate its excellent performance in experiments involving synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.

<title>ActAlign: Zero-Shot Fine-Grained Video Classification via Language-Guided Sequence Alignment</title>

arXiv:2506.22967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot video classification for extremely fine-grained actions (e.g., Windmill Dunk in basketball), where no video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen classes. While image-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition, they lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose ActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video classification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization strength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language model (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions across multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer parameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating that structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can unlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling agents.

<title>Mitigating Watermark Forgery in Generative Models via Multi-Key Watermarking</title>

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret watermarking key. A security threat to GenAI providers are \emph{forgery attacks}, where malicious users insert the provider's watermark into generated content that was \emph{not} produced by the provider's models, potentially damaging their reputation and undermining trust. One potential defense to resist forgery is using multiple keys to watermark generated content. However, it has been shown that forgery attacks remain successful when adversaries can collect sufficiently many watermarked samples. We propose an improved multi-key watermarking method that resists all surveyed forgery attacks and scales independently of the number of watermarked samples collected by the adversary. Our method accepts content as genuinely watermarked only if \emph{exactly} one watermark is detected. We focus on the image and text modalities, but our detection method is modality-agnostic, since it treats the underlying watermarking method as a black-box. We derive theoretical bounds on forgery-resistance and empirically validate them using Mistral-7B. Our results show a decrease in forgery success from up to $100\%$ using single-key baselines to only $2\%$. While our method resists all surveyed attacks, we find that highly capable, adaptive attackers can still achieve success rates of up to $65\%$ if watermarked content generated using different keys is easily separable.

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have demonstrated remarkable accuracy and robustness in diverse audio applications, such as live transcription and voice command processing. However, deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT device, wearables) still presents substantial challenges due to strict limits on memory, compute and power. Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining. Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear. In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy, memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR leader-board, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline, with detailed analysis tools. Our results characterize the trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that even $3$-bit quantization can succeed on high capacity models when using advanced PTQ techniques. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power, always-on edge devices.

Abstract: Transformers are the driving force behind today's Large Language Models (LLMs), serving as the foundation for their performance and versatility. Yet, their compute and memory costs grow with sequence length, posing scalability challenges for long-context inferencing. In response, the algorithm community is exploring alternative architectures, such as state space models (SSMs), linear attention, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which we refer to as post-transformers. This shift presents a key challenge: building a serving system that efficiently supports both transformer and post-transformer LLMs within a unified framework. To address this challenge, we analyze the performance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite their algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory bandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state updates in post-transformers. Further analyses suggest two additional insights: (1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making per-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision arithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify Microsoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we design Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared between two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a State-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers and adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of state update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to LLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 4.1x and 2.1x higher token generation throughput, respectively.

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements. Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification is a key and challenging task in video surveillance. While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting, occlusion, and suboptimal angles often hinder performance. To address these challenges, we introduce WhoFi, a novel pipeline that utilizes Wi-Fi signals for person re-identification. Biometric features are extracted from Channel State Information (CSI) and processed through a modular Deep Neural Network (DNN) featuring a Transformer-based encoder. The network is trained using an in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals.

In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a novel contrastive RL algorithm.
  CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x3.12 on L40, x2.50 on RTX 3090, x2.39 on H100, and x2.37 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources. We also identify important challenges posed by training RL models for tasks like CUDA development, where RL often learns to exploit loopholes in reward functions rather than solve the intended optimization problems. By identifying these failure modes and analyzing their root causes, we develop practical methods for creating more robust training procedures that prevent reward hacking.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing a difference of (smooth) convex functions over a compact convex feasible region $P$, i.e., $\min_{x \in P} f(x) - g(x)$, with smooth $f$ and Lipschitz continuous $g$. This computational study builds upon and complements the framework of Maskan et al. [2025] by integrating advanced Frank-Wolfe variants to reduce computational overhead. We empirically show that constrained DC problems can be efficiently solved using a combination of the Blended Pairwise Conditional Gradients (BPCG) algorithm [Tsuji et al., 2022] with warm-starting and the adaptive error bound from Maskan et al. [2025]. The result is a highly efficient and scalable projection-free algorithm for constrained DC optimization.

<title>Graph Neural Network-Based Predictor for Optimal Quantum Hardware Selection</title>

Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498 quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv, IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte). Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4% accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate, context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines. We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the degree to which it relies on this controller.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of 0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare, but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

Summary:
This paper introduces a new data-driven predictive model, ScaleSTF, for forecasting spatiotemporal dynamics in large-scale urban systems. The model addresses the trade-off between efficacy and efficiency faced by current models like graph neural networks by incorporating principles from physical laws. By integrating both micro- and macro-processes, ScaleSTF utilizes a scalable spatiotemporal Transformer structure with linear complexity. The attention layers in the model are induced by low-dimensional embeddings, leading to state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability.

Abstract: Networked urban systems facilitate the flow of people, resources, and services, and are essential for economic and social interactions. These systems often involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by sensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering contexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal dynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have shown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to computational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still require further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by drawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that align with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By understanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled interpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures whose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed scalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is validated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and smart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability. Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in large-scale urban networks.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Hump crossings, or high-profile Highway Railway Grade Crossings (HRGCs), pose safety risks to highway vehicles due to potential hang-ups. These crossings typically result from post-construction railway track maintenance activities or non-compliance with design guidelines for HRGC vertical alignments. Conventional methods for measuring HRGC profiles are costly, time-consuming, traffic-disruptive, and present safety challenges. To address these issues, this research employed advanced, cost-effective techniques and innovative modeling approaches for HRGC profile measurement. A novel hybrid deep learning framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer architectures was developed by utilizing instrumentation and ground truth data. Instrumentation data were gathered using a highway testing vehicle equipped with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors, while ground truth data were obtained via an industrial-standard walking profiler. Field data was collected at the Red Rock Railroad Corridor in Oklahoma. Three advanced deep learning models Transformer-LSTM sequential (model 1), LSTM-Transformer sequential (model 2), and LSTM-Transformer parallel (model 3) were evaluated to identify the most efficient architecture. Models 2 and 3 outperformed the others and were deployed to generate 2D/3D HRGC profiles. The deep learning models demonstrated significant potential to enhance highway and railroad safety by enabling rapid and accurate assessment of HRGC hang-up susceptibility.

- Regime detection is done using a DS-HDP-HMM model, with each regime then modeled by a CNP to predict hourly price trajectories.
- The model was compared against DNN and LEAR models in battery storage optimization scenarios, showing different strengths in profit generation, cost minimization, and risk management.
- TOPSIS analysis ranked LEAR as the top model in 2021, but the proposed R-NP model was found to be the most balanced and preferred solution for 2021, 2022, and 2023.
- The study highlights the importance of considering multiple criteria for evaluating prediction models, beyond just raw accuracy, to determine their suitability for different operational contexts. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This work integrates Bayesian regime detection with conditional neural processes for 24-hour electricity price prediction in the German market. Our methodology integrates regime detection using a disentangled sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (DS-HDP-HMM) applied to daily electricity prices. Each identified regime is subsequently modeled by an independent conditional neural process (CNP), trained to learn localized mappings from input contexts to 24-dimensional hourly price trajectories, with final predictions computed as regime-weighted mixtures of these CNP outputs. We rigorously evaluate R-NP against deep neural networks (DNN) and Lasso estimated auto-regressive (LEAR) models by integrating their forecasts into diverse battery storage optimization frameworks, including price arbitrage, risk management, grid services, and cost minimization. This operational utility assessment revealed complex performance trade-offs: LEAR often yielded superior absolute profits or lower costs, while DNN showed exceptional optimality in specific cost-minimization contexts. Recognizing that raw prediction accuracy doesn't always translate to optimal operational outcomes, we employed TOPSIS as a comprehensive multi-criteria evaluation layer. Our TOPSIS analysis identified LEAR as the top-ranked model for 2021, but crucially, our proposed R-NP model emerged as the most balanced and preferred solution for 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Summary: <br />
Developmental Federated Tuning (DevFT) is introduced as a resource-efficient method for adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. Inspired by cognitive development, DevFT decomposes the fine-tuning process into stages, optimizing submodels progressively with increasing parameter capacity. Knowledge transfer between stages accelerates training and prevents convergence to local minima. DevFT utilizes deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to efficiently build stage-specific submodels. Evaluations demonstrate DevFT outperforms existing methods, achieving faster convergence, reduced communication overhead, and improved performance on multiple benchmarks. The approach mirrors human learning, gradually constructing a comprehensive knowledge structure while refining existing skills. DevFT proves to be compatible with existing approaches while significantly enhancing efficiency and performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks while preserving data privacy, but its resource-intensive nature limits deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce Developmental Federated Tuning (DevFT), a resource-efficient approach inspired by cognitive development that progressively builds a powerful LLM from a compact foundation. DevFT decomposes the fine-tuning process into developmental stages, each optimizing submodels with increasing parameter capacity. Knowledge from earlier stages transfers to subsequent submodels, providing optimized initialization parameters that prevent convergence to local minima and accelerate training. This paradigm mirrors human learning, gradually constructing comprehensive knowledge structure while refining existing skills. To efficiently build stage-specific submodels, DevFT introduces deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to distill essential information and construct representative layers. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DevFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4.59$\times$ faster convergence, 10.67$\times$ reduction in communication overhead, and 9.07% average performance improvement, while maintaining compatibility with existing approaches.

Summary: 
Weight Similarity (WS) and Activation Similarity (AS) were compared in topographic convolutional neural networks. WS outperformed AS and standard CNNs in robustness to noise and input degradation, with higher accuracy under weight corruption. WS also showed greater input sensitivity and stronger functional localization, with units positioned closer when showing similar activations. WS influenced orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units, affecting the representational geometry of the network. These findings suggest that WS constraints during end-to-end training produce more robust representations than AS or non-topographic CNNs and can shape feature learning and functional organization in biophysically inspired models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topographic neural networks are computational models that can simulate the spatial and functional organization of the brain. Topographic constraints in neural networks can be implemented in multiple ways, with potentially different impacts on the representations learned by the network. The impact of such different implementations has not been systematically examined. To this end, here we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two spatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to develop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which enforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on classification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input degradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared to both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved robustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii) greater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii) stronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations positioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in orientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units, indicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational geometry of the network. Our findings suggest that during end-to-end training, WS constraints produce more robust representations than AS or non-topographic CNNs. These findings also suggest that weight-based spatial constraints can shape feature learning and functional organization in biophysical inspired models.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the importance of addressing partial observability in reinforcement learning algorithms and the need for comprehensive benchmarks to assess progress in this area. It argues that benchmark environments for evaluating algorithms should cover various forms of partial observability and demonstrate a significant performance gap between agents with different levels of state information. The authors introduce best-practice guidelines for benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial observability and present the open-source library POBAX, which includes recommended hyperparameters and algorithm implementations. They identify types of partial observability in different environments and select representative tasks such as localization, mapping, visual control, and games. These tasks are all memory improvable, requiring difficult memory functions to solve, providing a concrete signal for research in partial observability. The framework also includes GPU-scalable environments implemented in JAX for efficient experimentation. <div>
arXiv:2508.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for general reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to mitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to gauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only evaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature masking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of partial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown opponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two key properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to ensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the performance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors roughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where performance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with partial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice guidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial observability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable Benchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present in various environments and select representative environments for our benchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control, games, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory improvable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete signal for partial observability research. This framework includes recommended hyperparameters as well as algorithm implementations for fast, out-of-the-box evaluation, as well as highly performant environments implemented in JAX for GPU-scalable experimentation.

Summary:<br />
Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, especially with the growth of IoT and smart manufacturing data. Traditional statistical methods struggle with the high complexity of this data, leading to the proposal of the TriP-LLM framework. This novel approach integrates local and global features using a tri-branch design and a pretrained LLM to detect anomalies in time-series data effectively. Evaluation using the PATE metric on benchmark datasets shows TriP-LLM outperforms existing methods, highlighting its strong detection capabilities. Ablation studies confirm the significant impact of the LLM in the architecture, with TriP-LLM also showing lower memory consumption compared to CI patch processing methods. The code and model checkpoints are openly accessible, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in research. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of application domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically increased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the limitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high heterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision domains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A Tri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features through a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input time series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen, pretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from which anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public benchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation metric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to ensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating strong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies, we verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture. Compared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch processing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it more suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments. All code and model checkpoints are publicly available on https://github.com/YYZStart/TriP-LLM.git

This study introduces a novel approach that integrates a LightGBM regression model with genetic algorithm optimization to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 indicators on Bitcoin return prediction. A dataset encompassing daily Bitcoin returns and various COVID-19 metrics was compiled for analysis. Models trained with and without COVID-19 features were rigorously optimized using genetic algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy when COVID-19 indicators were included, particularly in capturing extreme market fluctuations. Vaccination metrics, notably the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as key predictors. The proposed methodology enhances financial analytics by incorporating public health data, offering valuable insights for investors and policymakers to navigate market uncertainties during crises. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This study proposes a novel methodological framework integrating a LightGBM regression model and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization to systematically evaluate the contribution of COVID-19-related indicators to Bitcoin return prediction. The primary objective was not merely to forecast Bitcoin returns but rather to determine whether including pandemic-related health data significantly enhances prediction accuracy. A comprehensive dataset comprising daily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics (vaccination rates, hospitalizations, testing statistics) was constructed. Predictive models, trained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31 independent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment. Performance metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE) were statistically compared through distribution overlaps and Mann-Whitney U tests. Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results indicate that COVID-19 indicators significantly improved model performance, particularly in capturing extreme market fluctuations (R2 increased by 40%, RMSE decreased by 2%, both highly significant statistically). Among COVID-19 features, vaccination metrics, especially the 75th percentile of fully vaccinated individuals, emerged as dominant predictors. The proposed methodology extends existing financial analytics tools by incorporating public health signals, providing investors and policymakers with refined indicators to navigate market uncertainty during systemic crises.

Abstract: This paper introduces Stress-Aware Learning, a resilient neural training paradigm in which deep neural networks dynamically adjust their optimization behavior - whether under stable training regimes or in settings with uncertain dynamics - based on the concept of Temporary (Elastic) and Permanent (Plastic) Deformation, inspired by structural fatigue in materials science. To instantiate this concept, we propose Plastic Deformation Optimizer, a stress-aware mechanism that injects adaptive noise into model parameters whenever an internal stress signal - reflecting stagnation in training loss and accuracy - indicates persistent optimization difficulty. This enables the model to escape sharp minima and converge toward flatter, more generalizable regions of the loss landscape. Experiments across six architectures, four optimizers, and seven vision benchmarks demonstrate improved robustness and generalization with minimal computational overhead. The code and 3D visuals will be available on GitHub: https://github.com/Stress-Aware-Learning/SAL.

Abstract: Liver diseases are a serious health concern in the world, which requires precise and timely diagnosis to enhance the survival chances of patients. The current literature implemented numerous machine learning and deep learning models to classify liver diseases, but most of them had some issues like high misclassification error, poor interpretability, prohibitive computational expense, and lack of good preprocessing strategies. In order to address these drawbacks, we introduced StackLiverNet in this study; an interpretable stacked ensemble model tailored to the liver disease detection task. The framework uses advanced data preprocessing and feature selection technique to increase model robustness and predictive ability. Random undersampling is performed to deal with class imbalance and make the training balanced. StackLiverNet is an ensemble of several hyperparameter-optimized base classifiers, whose complementary advantages are used through a LightGBM meta-model. The provided model demonstrates excellent performance, with the testing accuracy of 99.89%, Cohen Kappa of 0.9974, and AUC of 0.9993, having only 5 misclassifications, and efficient training and inference speeds that are amenable to clinical practice (training time 4.2783 seconds, inference time 0.1106 seconds). Besides, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) are applied to generate transparent explanations of individual predictions, revealing high concentrations of Alkaline Phosphatase and moderate SGOT as important observations of liver disease. Also, SHAP was used to rank features by their global contribution to predictions, while the Morris method confirmed the most influential features through sensitivity analysis.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, contemporary neural networks often lack structural safeguards that promote stable learning and interpretable behavior. In this work, we introduce a reformulation of layer-level transformations that departs from the standard unconstrained affine paradigm. Each transformation is decomposed into a structured linear operator and a residual corrective component, enabling more disciplined signal propagation and improved training dynamics. Our formulation encourages internal consistency and supports stable information flow across depth, while remaining fully compatible with standard learning objectives and backpropagation. Through a series of synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that models constructed with these structured transformations exhibit improved gradient conditioning, reduced sensitivity to perturbations, and layer-wise robustness. We further show that these benefits persist across architectural scales and training regimes. This study serves as a foundation for a more principled class of neural architectures that prioritize stability and transparency-offering new tools for reasoning about learning behavior without sacrificing expressive power.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an inexpensive and widely available tool for cardiac assessment. Despite its standardized format and small file size, the high complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a 60,000-size vector with 12 leads at 500 Hz) make it challenging to use in deep learning models, especially when only small training datasets are available. This study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods from representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE) variants-Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed beta-VAE (A beta-VAE), and Cyclical beta VAE (C beta-VAE)-and compare their effectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream prediction tasks using a Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM). The A beta-VAE achieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) to 15.7+/-3.2 muV, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE encodings, when combined with traditional ECG summary features, improved the prediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an holdout test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.901 with a LGBM classifier. This performance nearly matches the 0.909 AUROC of state-of-the-art CNN model but requires significantly less computational resources. Further, the ECG feature extraction-LGBM pipeline avoids overfitting and retains predictive performance when trained with less data. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective in simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep learning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.

Summary: 
The article introduces INSPIRE-GNN, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks to optimize sensor placement and enhance bicycling volume estimation accuracy in cities with limited sensor coverage. By strategically selecting additional sensor locations in Melbourne's bicycling network with high data sparsity, INSPIRE-GNN outperforms traditional heuristic methods and standard machine learning models in volume estimation performance.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycling volume estimation is essential for sustainable urban transportation planning. However, many cities face significant challenges of high data sparsity due to limited bicycling count sensor coverage. To address this issue, we propose INSPIRE-GNN, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-boosted hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework designed to optimize sensor placement and improve link-level bicycling volume estimation in data-sparse environments. INSPIRE-GNN integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based RL agent, enabling a data-driven strategic selection of sensor locations to maximize estimation performance. Applied to Melbourne's bicycling network, comprising 15,933 road segments with sensor coverage on only 141 road segments (99% sparsity) - INSPIRE-GNN demonstrates significant improvements in volume estimation by strategically selecting additional sensor locations in deployments of 50, 100, 200 and 500 sensors. Our framework outperforms traditional heuristic methods for sensor placement such as betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, observed bicycling activity and random placement, across key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Furthermore, our experiments benchmark INSPIRE-GNN against standard machine learning and deep learning models in the bicycle volume estimation performance, underscoring its effectiveness. Our proposed framework provides transport planners actionable insights to effectively expand sensor networks, optimize sensor placement and maximize volume estimation accuracy and reliability of bicycling data for informed transportation planning decisions.

<div> Keywords: interpretability, large language models, fine-tuned models, backdoors, model auditing <br />
Summary:
This paper introduces a new method for interpreting fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) by analyzing weights rather than activations. By focusing on the top singular vectors of weight differences between a model and its base model, new behaviors introduced during fine-tuning can be detected. This approach is especially useful for identifying out-of-distribution threats like backdoors, achieving high precision in detecting attacks. The method can also detect inference on erased topics in models that have undergone unlearning. Additionally, it can analyze commercial instruction-tuned models to uncover specific areas of fine-tuning focus, such as marketing strategies. The implementation of this method is available on GitHub for further exploration and application in monitoring, controlling, and auditing large language models. <br /><br />Summary: This paper presents a novel method for interpreting fine-tuned large language models using weight analysis to detect new behaviors, particularly useful for identifying out-of-distribution threats like backdoors. The approach achieves high precision in detecting attacks and can also identify inference on erased topics in unlearned models. Additionally, it can analyze commercial models for specific fine-tuning focus, such as marketing strategies, showcasing potential for pre-deployment model auditing. <div>
arXiv:2508.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.
  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision.
  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover "unlearned" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation.

<div> Keywords: regression, reinforcement learning, custom reward signal, Actor-Critic agent, Prioritized Experience Replay

Summary: 
Regressions are commonly performed using standard techniques with predefined loss functions like mean squared error, but these may not capture all aspects of a system. This study proposes a new approach by treating regression as a Reinforcement Learning problem. By framing a model's prediction as an action and defining a custom reward signal based on prediction error, the study demonstrates the use of powerful RL algorithms for function approximation. Through a case study on learning a noisy sine wave, the development of an Actor-Critic agent is showcased with enhancements like Prioritized Experience Replay, increased network capacity, and positional encoding. Results indicate that the RL framework not only effectively solves regression tasks but also provides greater flexibility in defining objectives and guiding the learning process.

arXiv:2508.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard regression techniques, while powerful, are often constrained by predefined, differentiable loss functions such as mean squared error. These functions may not fully capture the desired behavior of a system, especially when dealing with asymmetric costs or complex, non-differentiable objectives. In this paper, we explore an alternative paradigm: framing regression as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem. We demonstrate this by treating a model's prediction as an action and defining a custom reward signal based on the prediction error, and we can leverage powerful RL algorithms to perform function approximation. Through a progressive case study of learning a noisy sine wave, we illustrate the development of an Actor-Critic agent, iteratively enhancing it with Prioritized Experience Replay, increased network capacity, and positional encoding to enable a capable RL agent for this regression task. Our results show that the RL framework not only successfully solves the regression problem but also offers enhanced flexibility in defining objectives and guiding the learning process.

<div> Keywords: Stochasticity, Language Models, Fine-tuning, Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average, Convergence rates

Summary:
Stochasticity in language model fine-tuning can cause instability due to small batch sizes, leading to oscillations in generation quality. Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is used to reduce this instability but introduces bias from old iterates, resulting in lag in optimization. The Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA) proposed in this work eliminates bias while retaining variance-reduction benefits. The theoretical model shows provable acceleration of BEMA over EMA and vanilla training. Extensive experiments on Language Models demonstrate that BEMA improves convergence rates and final performance in standard benchmarks compared to EMA and vanilla training. BEMA is a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and efficient fine-tuning.

Stochasticity in language model fine-tuning can destabilize training, but the Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA) offers a solution by eliminating bias while retaining advantages. The theoretical model shows BEMA's acceleration over EMA and vanilla training, validated through experiments leading to improved convergence rates and final performance in Language Models benchmarks. BEMA presents a practical and theoretically grounded method for enhancing stability and efficiency in fine-tuning processes. <div>

Abstract: Stochasticity in language model fine-tuning, often caused by the small batch sizes typically used in this regime, can destabilize training by introducing large oscillations in generation quality. A popular approach to mitigating this instability is to take an Exponential moving average (EMA) of weights throughout training. While EMA reduces stochasticity, thereby smoothing training, the introduction of bias from old iterates often creates a lag in optimization relative to vanilla training. In this work, we propose the Bias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA), a simple and practical augmentation of EMA that retains variance-reduction benefits while eliminating bias. BEMA is motivated by a simple theoretical model wherein we demonstrate provable acceleration of BEMA over both a standard EMA and vanilla training. Through an extensive suite of experiments on Language Models, we show that BEMA leads to significantly improved convergence rates and final performance over both EMA and vanilla training in a variety of standard LM benchmarks, making BEMA a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and efficient fine-tuning.

Summary:
RecoMind introduces a simulator-based reinforcement learning framework called RecoMind that is designed to optimize session-based goals at a web-scale. By leveraging existing recommendation models and custom exploration strategies, RecoMind simplifies the training and deployment of RL policies, making it suitable for use in industry pipelines. The framework was evaluated through extensive offline simulations and online A/B testing on a video streaming platform, showing significant improvements in in-session user satisfaction compared to traditional supervised learning approaches. In online tests, the RL policy trained using RecoMind increased the number of videos watched by users and improved session depth, showcasing the effectiveness of the framework in optimizing session-based user satisfaction. RecoMind offers a scalable and systematic approach for embedding RL into web-scale recommendation systems, demonstrating its potential to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing web-scale recommendation systems commonly use supervised learning methods that prioritize immediate user feedback. Although reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to optimize longer-term goals, such as in-session engagement, applying it at web scale is challenging due to the extremely large action space and engineering complexity. In this paper, we introduce RecoMind, a simulator-based RL framework designed for the effective optimization of session-based goals at web-scale. RecoMind leverages existing recommendation models to establish a simulation environment and to bootstrap the RL policy to optimize immediate user interactions from the outset. This method integrates well with existing industry pipelines, simplifying the training and deployment of RL policies. Additionally, RecoMind introduces a custom exploration strategy to efficiently explore web-scale action spaces with hundreds of millions of items. We evaluated RecoMind through extensive offline simulations and online A/B testing on a video streaming platform. Both methods showed that the RL policy trained using RecoMind significantly outperforms traditional supervised learning recommendation approaches in in-session user satisfaction. In online A/B tests, the RL policy increased videos watched for more than 10 seconds by 15.81\% and improved session depth by 4.71\% for sessions with at least 10 interactions. As a result, RecoMind presents a systematic and scalable approach for embedding RL into web-scale recommendation systems, showing great promise for optimizing session-based user satisfaction.

Summary:<br />
- Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets are essential for downstream machine learning tasks, especially when labeled data is costly.

- Utilizing k-nearest neighbor (kNN) methods and local geometry, the proposed approach improves performance in noisy data scenarios.
- By incorporating geometry information and reliability estimation, the method achieves better robustness, particularly in the presence of severe label noise.

arXiv:2508.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper, following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

Summary: 
The study compares full-rank and low-rank parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark. Results show that low-rank methods struggle with matrices having high effective ranks. Introducing KRAdapter, leveraging Khatri-Rao product for generating weight updates, improves performance on large models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. KRAdapter maintains the efficiency of low-rank methods while being more robust for fine-tuning billion-scale parameter models. <div>
arXiv:2508.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a standard approach for adapting large pre-trained models. Amongst PEFT methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved notable success. However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations compared against full-rank alternatives, particularly when applied to multimodal and large language models. In this work, we present a quantitative comparison amongst full-rank and low-rank PEFT methods using a synthetic matrix approximation benchmark with controlled spectral properties. Our results confirm that LoRA struggles to approximate matrices with relatively flat spectrums or high frequency components -- signs of high effective ranks. To this end, we introduce KRAdapter, a novel PEFT algorithm that leverages the Khatri-Rao product to produce weight updates, which, by construction, tends to produce matrix product with a high effective rank. We demonstrate performance gains with KRAdapter on vision-language models up to 1B parameters and on large language models up to 8B parameters, particularly on unseen common-sense reasoning tasks. In addition, KRAdapter maintains the memory and compute efficiency of LoRA, making it a practical and robust alternative to fine-tune billion-scale parameter models.

<div> Keywords: natural language processing, language models, instruction-following ability, confidence calibration, label smoothing
Summary: 
Recent advancements in natural language processing have led to more powerful interactive agents through fine-tuned large language models. However, research on the impact of this on confidence calibration for reliable model output is lacking. This study focuses on various open-sourced large language models and identifies degradation in calibration after instruction tuning. The use of label smoothing, known for regularizing overconfident predictions, is proposed as a practical solution for calibration maintenance during supervised fine-tuning. The study highlights the effectiveness of label smoothing in preserving calibration throughout the fine-tuning process. Challenges arise in maintaining calibration with large vocabulary language models, attributed to over-confidence related to hidden size and vocabulary size. An innovative approach to reduce memory consumption in label-smoothed loss computation is also introduced, without compromising speed or performance compared to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater opportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as more powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following ability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for reliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine various open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation after instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards label smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for overconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing is sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However, settings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in particular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to stem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship with the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and experimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory footprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss setting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory consumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing solutions for non-smoothed losses.

<div> tutoring system, feedback, multi-armed bandit, contextual bandit, student outcomes
Summary:<br /><br />An online tutoring system has been developed to provide effective feedback to students after answering questions incorrectly. Using data from a million students, the system learns optimal assistance actions for each question through the multi-armed bandit framework. An algorithm is designed to enhance immediate second attempt success and overall session performance. The system significantly improves student outcomes in practice sessions. While contextual bandit policies may personalize feedback based on individual student features, the analysis suggests that the effect heterogeneity of actions across students may not be significant enough for contextual bandit policies to outperform well-optimized multi-armed bandit policies. Insights gained from deploying data-driven systems at scale highlight the importance of refining teaching policies to support thousands of students daily. <div>

Abstract: We present an online tutoring system that learns to provide effective feedback to students after they answer questions incorrectly. Using data from one million students, the system learns which assistance action (e.g., one of multiple hints) to provide for each question to optimize student learning. Employing the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework and offline policy evaluation, we assess 43,000 assistance actions, and identify trade-offs between assistance policies optimized for different student outcomes (e.g., response correctness, session completion). We design an algorithm that for each question decides on a suitable policy training objective to enhance students' immediate second attempt success and overall practice session performance. We evaluate the resulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant improvements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the overall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit (CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on individual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using causal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across students and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect heterogeneity, outperform MAB policies. While our analysis reveals that some actions for some questions exhibit effect heterogeneity, effect sizes may often be too small for CB policies to provide significant improvements beyond what well-optimized MAB policies that deliver the same action to all students already achieve. We discuss insights gained from deploying data-driven systems at scale and implications for future refinements. Today, the teaching policies optimized by our system support thousands of students daily.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel methodology for performance-based seismic design by treating it as an inverse engineering problem. The approach involves using explainable machine learning models to directly link design parameters and performance objectives, eliminating computational inefficiencies. An evaluation function integrating machine learning models is then incorporated into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem efficiently.

Abstract: This study presents a methodology to treat performance-based seismic design as an inverse engineering problem, where design parameters are directly derived to achieve specific performance objectives. By implementing explainable machine learning models, this methodology directly maps design variables and performance metrics, tackling computational inefficiencies of performance-based design. The resultant machine learning model is integrated as an evaluation function into a genetic optimization algorithm to solve the inverse problem. The developed methodology is then applied to two different inventories of steel and concrete moment frames in Los Angeles and Charleston to obtain sectional properties of frame members that minimize expected annualized seismic loss in terms of repair costs. The results show high accuracy of the surrogate models (e.g., R2> 90%) across a diverse set of building types, geometries, seismic design, and site hazard, where the optimization algorithm could identify the optimum values of members' properties for a fixed set of geometric variables, consistent with engineering principles.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces GOODFormer, a Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer that aims to learn generalized graph representations under distribution shifts. It achieves this by optimizing three modules: an entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs, an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to capture dynamically changing subgraphs, and an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations to derive generalizable graph representations. The method provides theoretical justifications and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in experiments on benchmark datasets. It focuses on capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels, preserving attention sharpness, effectively encoding subgraph information, and deriving generalizable representations for unseen graphs. <div>

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated great effectiveness across various graph analytical tasks. However, the existing GTs focus on training and testing graph data originated from the same distribution, but fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Graph invariant learning, aiming to capture generalizable graph structural patterns with labels under distribution shifts, is potentially a promising solution, but how to design attention mechanisms and positional and structural encodings (PSEs) based on graph invariant learning principles remains challenging. To solve these challenges, we introduce Graph Out-Of-Distribution generalized Transformer (GOODFormer), aiming to learn generalized graph representations by capturing invariant relationships between predictive graph structures and labels through jointly optimizing three modules. Specifically, we first develop a GT-based entropy-guided invariant subgraph disentangler to separate invariant and variant subgraphs while preserving the sharpness of the attention function. Next, we design an evolving subgraph positional and structural encoder to effectively and efficiently capture the encoding information of dynamically changing subgraphs during training. Finally, we propose an invariant learning module utilizing subgraph node representations and encodings to derive generalizable graph representations that can to unseen graphs. We also provide theoretical justifications for our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.

Summary:
The article introduces a Plug-and-Play algorithm, PnP-DA, designed to improve Earth system modeling by blending observations with model forecasts. Traditional methods assume Gaussian error statistics, limiting their effectiveness in capturing the true behavior of chaotic systems. PnP-DA uses a lightweight analysis update and a pretrained generative prior to optimize the assimilation process without requiring explicit regularization. By leveraging historical data and avoiding gradient backpropagation through complex neural networks, PnP-DA reduces forecast errors across various observation sparsities and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods. This approach enhances the accuracy of Earth system modeling while maintaining computational efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth system modeling presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing: capturing complex, multiscale nonlinear dynamics in computationally efficient models while minimizing forecast errors caused by necessary simplifications. Even the most powerful AI- or physics-based forecast system suffer from gradual error accumulation. Data assimilation (DA) aims to mitigate these errors by optimally blending (noisy) observations with prior model forecasts, but conventional variational methods often assume Gaussian error statistics that fail to capture the true, non-Gaussian behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. We propose PnP-DA, a Plug-and-Play algorithm that alternates (1) a lightweight, gradient-based analysis update (using a Mahalanobis-distance misfit on new observations) with (2) a single forward pass through a pretrained generative prior conditioned on the background forecast via a conditional Wasserstein coupling. This strategy relaxes restrictive statistical assumptions and leverages rich historical data without requiring an explicit regularization functional, and it also avoids the need to backpropagate gradients through the complex neural network that encodes the prior during assimilation cycles. Experiments on standard chaotic testbeds demonstrate that this strategy consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of observation sparsities and noise levels, outperforming classical variational methods.

Summary: 
This study explores the internal computational structure development of language models in deep learning using susceptibility analysis, a concept from statistical physics. By applying UMAP to the susceptibility matrix, the researchers visualized the model's structural progress during training. The visualizations unveiled the emergence of a distinct "body plan" in the network, showcasing familiar features like the induction circuit and revealing new structures like the "spacing fin" that counts space tokens. This innovative approach goes beyond validation to discover novel mechanisms within neural networks, offering a comprehensive perspective on their developmental principles.

Abstract: Understanding how language models develop their internal computational structure is a central problem in the science of deep learning. While susceptibilities, drawn from statistical physics, offer a promising analytical tool, their full potential for visualizing network organization remains untapped. In this work, we introduce an embryological approach, applying UMAP to the susceptibility matrix to visualize the model's structural development over training. Our visualizations reveal the emergence of a clear ``body plan,'' charting the formation of known features like the induction circuit and discovering previously unknown structures, such as a ``spacing fin'' dedicated to counting space tokens. This work demonstrates that susceptibility analysis can move beyond validation to uncover novel mechanisms, providing a powerful, holistic lens for studying the developmental principles of complex neural networks.

Summary: <br />
- The paper introduces the BOOD framework for generating high-quality out-of-distribution (OOD) data using diffusion models and text-conditioned latent feature space.
- BOOD focuses on identifying decision boundaries in the latent space to effectively create OOD features by perturbing in-distribution features.
- The synthetic OOD features are decoded into human-compatible outlier images using a diffusion model, enhancing the clarity between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.
- Experimental results on CIFAR-100 dataset show that BOOD outperforms existing methods significantly, with a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 and a 7.27% improvement in average AUROC.
- The proposed approach not only improves OOD detection performance but also provides a more efficient strategy for synthesizing informative OOD features. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing the power of diffusion models to synthesize auxiliary training data based on latent space features has proven effective in enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. However, extracting effective features outside the in-distribution (ID) boundary in latent space remains challenging due to the difficulty of identifying decision boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a novel framework called Boundary-based Out-Of-Distribution data generation (BOOD), which synthesizes high-quality OOD features and generates human-compatible outlier images using diffusion models. BOOD first learns a text-conditioned latent feature space from the ID dataset, selects ID features closest to the decision boundary, and perturbs them to cross the decision boundary to form OOD features. These synthetic OOD features are then decoded into images in pixel space by a diffusion model. Compared to previous works, BOOD provides a more training efficient strategy for synthesizing informative OOD features, facilitating clearer distinctions between ID and OOD data. Extensive experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that BOOD surpasses the state-of-the-art method significantly, achieving a 29.64% decrease in average FPR95 (40.31% vs. 10.67%) and a 7.27% improvement in average AUROC (90.15% vs. 97.42%) on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

Summary: <br />
This paper addresses the issue of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by introducing a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration). SGPC combines cellular-sheaf message passing with optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization to improve robust semi-supervised node classification. The architecture provides rigorous stability guarantees and outperforms existing models on homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. SGPC's end-to-end training approach achieves optimal performance in linear computational complexity, offering certified confidence intervals for unseen nodes. <div>
arXiv:2508.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) causes collapse in distinct node features, particularly on heterophilic graphs where adjacent nodes often have dissimilar labels. Although sheaf neural networks partially mitigate this problem, they typically rely on static or heavily parameterized sheaf structures that hinder generalization and scalability. Existing sheaf-based models either predefine restriction maps or introduce excessive complexity, yet fail to provide rigorous stability guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a novel scheme called SGPC (Sheaf GNNs with PAC-Bayes Calibration), a unified architecture that combines cellular-sheaf message passing with several mechanisms, including optimal transport-based lifting, variance-reduced diffusion, and PAC-Bayes spectral regularization for robust semi-supervised node classification. We establish performance bounds theoretically and demonstrate that the resulting bound-aware objective can be achieved via end-to-end training in linear computational complexity. Experiments on nine homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks show that SGPC outperforms state-of-the-art spectral and sheaf-based GNNs while providing certified confidence intervals on unseen nodes.

Summary:<br />
Designing residential interiors is crucial for occupant satisfaction, but existing methods face challenges like unstructured layouts and high computational demands. The proposed OID-PPO framework addresses these issues by integrating expert-defined guidelines into the reward function and using a Gaussian policy for flexible furniture placement. This approach outperforms existing methods in layout quality and computational efficiency across various room shapes and furniture configurations. Ablation studies show the importance of structured guideline integration and highlight the impact of individual design constraints. <div>
arXiv:2508.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing residential interiors strongly impacts occupant satisfaction but remains challenging due to unstructured spatial layouts, high computational demands, and reliance on expert knowledge. Existing methods based on optimization or deep learning are either computationally expensive or constrained by data scarcity. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often limit furniture placement to discrete positions and fail to incorporate design principles adequately. We propose OID-PPO, a novel RL framework for Optimal Interior Design using Proximal Policy Optimization, which integrates expert-defined functional and visual guidelines into a structured reward function. OID-PPO utilizes a diagonal Gaussian policy for continuous and flexible furniture placement, effectively exploring latent environmental dynamics under partial observability. Experiments conducted across diverse room shapes and furniture configurations demonstrate that OID-PPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of layout quality and computational efficiency. Ablation studies further demonstrate the impact of structured guideline integration and reveal the distinct contributions of individual design constraints.

<div> Keywords: adaptive regret, online learning, convex functions, dual adaptivity, meta-expert framework

Summary:
This paper introduces a new performance measure called adaptive regret in online learning to address changing environments. Existing algorithms for online convex optimization lack universality and require prior knowledge of parameters. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes dual adaptive algorithms that automatically adapt to different function types and environments. A meta-expert framework is introduced, where multiple experts are dynamically created and aggregated by a meta-algorithm. The algorithms can handle convex, exponentially concave, or strongly convex functions and accommodate unknown function types. The technique of sleeping experts is incorporated to capture changing environments. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithms can minimize the adaptive regret for multiple convex function types simultaneously and allow the type of functions to switch between rounds. The framework is extended to online composite optimization, providing a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of composite functions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To deal with changing environments, a new performance measure -- adaptive regret, defined as the maximum static regret over any interval, was proposed in online learning. Under the setting of online convex optimization, several algorithms have been successfully developed to minimize the adaptive regret. However, existing algorithms lack universality in the sense that they can only handle one type of convex functions and need apriori knowledge of parameters, which hinders their application in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper investigates universal algorithms with dual adaptivity, which automatically adapt to the property of functions (convex, exponentially concave, or strongly convex), as well as the nature of environments (stationary or changing). Specifically, we propose a meta-expert framework for dual adaptive algorithms, where multiple experts are created dynamically and aggregated by a meta-algorithm. The meta-algorithm is required to yield a second-order bound, which can accommodate unknown function types. We further incorporate the technique of sleeping experts to capture the changing environments. For the construction of experts, we introduce two strategies (increasing the number of experts or enhancing the capabilities of experts) to achieve universality. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithms are able to minimize the adaptive regret for multiple types of convex functions simultaneously, and also allow the type of functions to switch between rounds. Moreover, we extend our meta-expert framework to online composite optimization, and develop a universal algorithm for minimizing the adaptive regret of composite functions.

Abstract: Nowadays machine learning (ML) practitioners have access to numerous ML libraries available online. Such libraries can be used to create ML pipelines that consist of a series of steps where each step may invoke up to several ML libraries that are used for various data-driven analytical tasks. Development of high-quality ML pipelines is non-trivial; it requires training, ML expertise, and careful development of each step. At the same time, domain experts in science and engineering may not possess such ML expertise and training while they are in pressing need of ML-based analytics. In this paper, we present our ExeKGLib, a Python library enhanced with a graphical interface layer that allows users with minimal ML knowledge to build ML pipelines. This is achieved by relying on knowledge graphs that encode ML knowledge in simple terms accessible to non-ML experts. ExeKGLib also allows improving the transparency and reusability of the built ML workflows and ensures that they are executable. We show the usability and usefulness of ExeKGLib by presenting real use cases.

Summary:<br /> 
The article introduces a novel RL framework called Co-Reward that leverages contrastive agreement across semantically analogical questions as a reward basis. This self-supervised reward-shaping mechanism increases the difficulty of learning collapse into a trivial solution and promotes stable reasoning elicitation by expanding input sample variants. Co-Reward outperforms other self-reward baselines on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLM series, surpassing ground-truth labeled reward by up to +6.8% on MATH500 over GT reward on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. The proposed approach addresses the scaling up dilemma in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards and offers a promising solution for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. The code for Co-Reward is publicly available on GitHub. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) shows promise in improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), the scaling up dilemma remains due to the reliance on human annotated labels especially for complex tasks. Recent alternatives that explore various self-reward signals exhibit the eliciting potential of LLM reasoning, but suffer from the non-negligible collapse issue. Inspired by the success of self-supervised learning, we propose \textit{Co-Reward}, a novel RL framework that leverages contrastive agreement across semantically analogical questions as a reward basis. Specifically, we construct a similar question for each training sample (without labels) and synthesize their individual surrogate labels through a simple rollout voting, and then the reward is constructed by cross-referring the labels of each question pair to enforce the internal reasoning consistency across analogical inputs. Intuitively, such a self-supervised reward-shaping mechanism increases the difficulty of learning collapse into a trivial solution, and promotes stable reasoning elicitation and improvement through expanding the input sample variants. Empirically, Co-Reward achieves superior performance compared to other self-reward baselines on multiple reasoning benchmarks and LLM series, and reaches or even surpasses ground-truth (GT) labeled reward, with improvements of up to $+6.8\%$ on MATH500 over GT reward on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/Co-Reward.

Summary:<br />
The study introduces ctdGAN, a conditional GAN designed to address class imbalance in tabular datasets. It incorporates a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to input samples, ensuring generation in similar subspaces as original data. A novel probabilistic sampling strategy and loss function penalizing cluster and class mis-predictions enhance sample synthesis. Additionally, a cluster-wise scaling technique capturing multiple feature modes without affecting data dimensionality is implemented. Evaluation with 14 imbalanced datasets proves ctdGAN's superior ability to generate high fidelity samples and improve classification accuracy. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tabular form constitutes the standard way of representing data in relational database systems and spreadsheets. But, similarly to other forms, tabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious performance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the most effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the under-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed GAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the real data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover, the class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical variables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less effective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a conditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially, ctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input samples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a novel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes both cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to generate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data distribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple, yet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature modes without affecting data dimensionality. The exhaustive evaluation of ctdGAN with 14 imbalanced datasets demonstrated its superiority in generating high fidelity samples and improving classification accuracy.

Summary:
The study introduces CoLL, a framework for graph anomaly detection in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) that combines large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). By leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs and the high-order topological information preservation of GNNs, CoLL achieves superior anomaly detection performance. The framework employs multi-LLM collaboration to capture anomaly-relevant contexts and provide human-readable rationales for detected anomalies. Additionally, a GNN with a gating mechanism is used to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence from the TAGs. Through extensive experiments, CoLL outperforms existing methods in anomaly detection, showing an average improvement of 13.37% in Average Precision (AP). This research paves the way for integrating LLMs in enhancing graph anomaly detection methods. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural combination of intricate topological structures and rich textual information in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) opens up a novel perspective for graph anomaly detection (GAD). However, existing GAD methods primarily focus on designing complex optimization objectives within the graph domain, overlooking the complementary value of the textual modality, whose features are often encoded by shallow embedding techniques, such as bag-of-words or skip-gram, so that semantic context related to anomalies may be missed. To unleash the enormous potential of textual modality, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives due to their strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, their application to TAG anomaly detection remains nascent, and they struggle to encode high-order structural information inherent in graphs due to input length constraints. For high-quality anomaly detection in TAGs, we propose CoLL, a novel framework that combines LLMs and graph neural networks (GNNs) to leverage their complementary strengths. CoLL employs multi-LLM collaboration for evidence-augmented generation to capture anomaly-relevant contexts while delivering human-readable rationales for detected anomalies. Moreover, CoLL integrates a GNN equipped with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse textual features with evidence while preserving high-order topological information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoLL, achieving an average improvement of 13.37% in AP. This study opens a new avenue for incorporating LLMs in advancing GAD.

The paper introduces a novel approach, CMUCL, for detecting anomalies in text-attributed graphs. It addresses the challenge of integrating raw text and graph topology to improve anomaly detection. By jointly training text and graph encoders using cross-modal and uni-modal multi-scale consistency, CMUCL uncovers anomaly-related information effectively. An anomaly score estimator based on inconsistency mining is designed to calculate node-specific anomaly scores. Additionally, the paper addresses the lack of benchmark datasets for anomaly detection on text-attributed graphs by releasing 8 datasets. Evaluations demonstrate that CMUCL significantly advances text-attributed graph anomaly detection, achieving an 11.13% increase in average accuracy compared to existing approaches. <div>

Abstract: The widespread application of graph data in various high-risk scenarios has increased attention to graph anomaly detection (GAD). Faced with real-world graphs that often carry node descriptions in the form of raw text sequences, termed text-attributed graphs (TAGs), existing graph anomaly detection pipelines typically involve shallow embedding techniques to encode such textual information into features, and then rely on complex self-supervised tasks within the graph domain to detect anomalies. However, this text encoding process is separated from the anomaly detection training objective in the graph domain, making it difficult to ensure that the extracted textual features focus on GAD-relevant information, seriously constraining the detection capability. How to seamlessly integrate raw text and graph topology to unleash the vast potential of cross-modal data in TAGs for anomaly detection poses a challenging issue. This paper presents a novel end-to-end paradigm for text-attributed graph anomaly detection, named CMUCL. We simultaneously model data from both text and graph structures, and jointly train text and graph encoders by leveraging cross-modal and uni-modal multi-scale consistency to uncover potential anomaly-related information. Accordingly, we design an anomaly score estimator based on inconsistency mining to derive node-specific anomaly scores. Considering the lack of benchmark datasets tailored for anomaly detection on TAGs, we release 8 datasets to facilitate future research. Extensive evaluations show that CMUCL significantly advances in text-attributed graph anomaly detection, delivering an 11.13% increase in average accuracy (AP) over the suboptimal.

<div> Delayed Feedback, Bandit Optimization, Nonsubmodular Functions, Regret Bound, Gradient Estimator  
Summary:   
- The study focuses on online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed feedback in the bandit setting.
- The loss function considered is $\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular and $\beta$-weakly DR-supermodular.
- Previous work had a regret bound dependent on the maximum delay $d$, making it sensitive to irregular delays.
- Two algorithms are proposed to tackle these limitations - DBGD-NF and an extended version with a blocking update mechanism.
- The regret bounds achieved by the algorithms are $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and $\mathcal{O}(n(T^{2/3} + \sqrt{dT}))$, respectively, with experimental validation in structured sparse learning.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We investigate the online nonsubmodular optimization with delayed feedback in the bandit setting, where the loss function is $\alpha$-weakly DR-submodular and $\beta$-weakly DR-supermodular. Previous work has established an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(nd^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $n$ is the dimensionality and $d$ is the maximum delay. However, its regret bound relies on the maximum delay and is thus sensitive to irregular delays. Additionally, it couples the effects of delays and bandit feedback as its bound is the product of the delay term and the $\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ regret bound in the bandit setting without delayed feedback. In this paper, we develop two algorithms to address these limitations, respectively. Firstly, we propose a novel method, namely DBGD-NF, which employs the one-point gradient estimator and utilizes all the available estimated gradients in each round to update the decision. It achieves a better $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret bound, which is relevant to the average delay $\bar{d} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T d_t\leq d$. Secondly, we extend DBGD-NF by employing a blocking update mechanism to decouple the joint effect of the delays and bandit feedback, which enjoys an $\mathcal{O}(n(T^{2/3} + \sqrt{dT}))$ regret bound. When $d = \mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$, our regret bound matches the $\mathcal{O}(nT^{2/3})$ bound in the bandit setting without delayed feedback. Compared to our first $\mathcal{O}(n\bar{d}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ bound, it is more advantageous when the maximum delay $d = o(\bar{d}^{2/3}T^{1/3})$. Finally, we conduct experiments on structured sparse learning to demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

<div> Keywords: hyperspectral imaging, mineral mapping, signal-to-noise ratio, spectral smoothing, endmember spectra <br />
Summary: 
This study presents a two-stage integrated framework for enhancing mineral detection in the Cuprite mining district using hyperspectral imaging. In the first stage, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) evaluation is performed for each spectral band, followed by the application of a phase-locked thresholding technique to eliminate low-SNR bands and reduce redundancy and background noise. Spectral smoothing through Savitzky-Golay filtering further refines the data by preserving fine-grained spectral features. In the second stage, the refined data is utilized for KMeans clustering to extract 12 endmember spectra, which are then subjected to non-negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing. Comparison of the resulting endmembers with laboratory spectra demonstrates improved accuracy in mineral detection. This two-pass strategy offers a practical and reproducible solution for spectral dimensionality reduction and unmixing in geological hyperspectral imaging applications. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging offers detailed spectral information for mineral mapping; however, weak mineral signatures are often masked by noisy and redundant bands, limiting detection performance. To address this, we propose a two-stage integrated framework for enhanced mineral detection in the Cuprite mining district. In the first stage, we compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each spectral band and apply a phase-locked thresholding technique to discard low-SNR bands, effectively removing redundancy and suppressing background noise. Savitzky-Golay filtering is then employed for spectral smoothing, serving a dual role first to stabilize trends during band selection, and second to preserve fine-grained spectral features during preprocessing. In the second stage, the refined HSI data is reintroduced into the model, where KMeans clustering is used to extract 12 endmember spectra (W1 custom), followed by non negative least squares (NNLS) for abundance unmixing. The resulting endmembers are quantitatively compared with laboratory spectra (W1 raw) using cosine similarity and RMSE metrics. Experimental results confirm that our proposed pipeline improves unmixing accuracy and enhances the detection of weak mineral zones. This two-pass strategy demonstrates a practical and reproducible solution for spectral dimensionality reduction and unmixing in geological HSI applications.

Summary: 
Interpretability in AI models is currently lacking actionable definitions, hindering the development of sound and robust interpretable models. Existing definitions fail to provide users with guidance on how to design interpretable models effectively. To address this issue, a new definition of interpretability is proposed, aiming to be general, simple, and inclusive of informal notions prevalent in the interpretable AI community. This new definition offers actionable insights into the foundational properties, assumptions, principles, data structures, and architectural features essential for creating interpretable models. Additionally, a general blueprint for designing interpretable models is introduced, accompanied by the launch of an open-sourced library that supports interpretable data structures and processes. These developments seek to advance the field of interpretable AI by providing practitioners with the tools and knowledge needed to develop reliable and understandable models.

Abstract: We argue that existing definitions of interpretability are not actionable in that they fail to inform users about general, sound, and robust interpretable model design. This makes current interpretability research fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose a definition of interpretability that is general, simple, and subsumes existing informal notions within the interpretable AI community. We show that our definition is actionable, as it directly reveals the foundational properties, underlying assumptions, principles, data structures, and architectural features necessary for designing interpretable models. Building on this, we propose a general blueprint for designing interpretable models and introduce the first open-sourced library with native support for interpretable data structures and processes.

<div> Keywords: Hydrogen atom transfer, machine-learned potentials, peptide, graph neural network, reaction rates<br />
Summary:<br />
Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions play a crucial role in various biological processes but understanding their mechanistic pathways is challenging. This study explores the use of machine-learned potentials to simulate HAT reactions with near-quantum accuracy. By generating HAT configurations in peptides using semiempirical methods and DFT, a large dataset is built and three graph neural network architectures are benchmarked. MACE outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, enabling accurate prediction of reaction barriers. Integration of ML potentials into collagen simulations allows for the computation of reaction rates and advances understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. Analysis of scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs provides insights for future improvements through the combination of ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. This approach can be applied to other biomolecular systems for quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments. <div>
arXiv:2508.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are essential in many biological processes, such as radical migration in damaged proteins, but their mechanistic pathways remain incompletely understood. Simulating HAT is challenging due to the need for quantum chemical accuracy at biologically relevant scales; thus, neither classical force fields nor DFT-based molecular dynamics are applicable. Machine-learned potentials offer an alternative, able to learn potential energy surfaces (PESs) with near-quantum accuracy. However, training these models to generalize across diverse HAT configurations, especially at radical positions in proteins, requires tailored data generation and careful model selection. Here, we systematically generate HAT configurations in peptides to build large datasets using semiempirical methods and DFT. We benchmark three graph neural network architectures (SchNet, Allegro, and MACE) on their ability to learn HAT PESs and indirectly predict reaction barriers from energy predictions. MACE consistently outperforms the others in energy, force, and barrier prediction, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.13 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution DFT barrier predictions. This accuracy enables integration of ML potentials into large-scale collagen simulations to compute reaction rates from predicted barriers, advancing mechanistic understanding of HAT and radical migration in peptides. We analyze scaling laws, model transferability, and cost-performance trade-offs, and outline strategies for improvement by combining ML potentials with transition state search algorithms and active learning. Our approach is generalizable to other biomolecular systems, enabling quantum-accurate simulations of chemical reactivity in complex environments.

<div> Keywords: Active Learning, Data Augmentation, Semi-supervised Learning, Low Data Problem, Performance Improvement<br />
Summary:<br />
Active Learning (AL) is often not practical due to its high computational cost and limited performance gains in low data scenarios. This study compares AL with data augmentation (DA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods to address the low data problem. While AL alone provides minimal improvement over random sampling, DA and SSL methods can offer significant performance boosts up to 60%. Interestingly, when AL is combined with strong DA and SSL techniques, it can still enhance performance. The findings suggest that AL should be seen as a final refinement step after applying DA and SSL techniques to maximize performance on limited labeled data. <div>
arXiv:2508.00586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though Active Learning (AL) is widely studied, it is rarely applied in contexts outside its own scientific literature. We posit that the reason for this is AL's high computational cost coupled with the comparatively small lifts it is typically able to generate in scenarios with few labeled points. In this work we study the impact of different methods to combat this low data scenario, namely data augmentation (DA), semi-supervised learning (SSL) and AL. We find that AL is by far the least efficient method of solving the low data problem, generating a lift of only 1-4\% over random sampling, while DA and SSL methods can generate up to 60\% lift in combination with random sampling. However, when AL is combined with strong DA and SSL techniques, it surprisingly is still able to provide improvements. Based on these results, we frame AL not as a method to combat missing labels, but as the final building block to squeeze the last bits of performance out of data after appropriate DA and SSL methods as been applied.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that utilizes a hybrid similarity measure to build patient similarity graphs from multi-modal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. The model, along with the HybridGraphMedGNN architecture, predicts criticalness in ICU patients, including in-ICU mortality risk, by integrating various graph convolutional network layers. Through experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III dataset, the SBSCGM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline classifiers and single-type Graph Neural Network (GNN) models with an AUC-ROC of 0.94. The model also demonstrates improved precision/recall rates and offers interpretable insights into predictions through the attention mechanism. Overall, the proposed framework presents a scalable and interpretable solution for ICU risk prediction, providing potential support for clinicians in real-world ICU settings.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However, conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure (combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and global graph patterns. In experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC $0.94$) outperforming baseline classifiers and single-type GNN models. We also demonstrate improved precision/recall and show that the attention mechanism provides interpretable insights into model predictions. Our framework offers a scalable and interpretable solution for critical care risk prediction, with potential to support clinicians in real-world ICU deployment.

Summary: 
IAMAP is a new user-friendly QGIS plugin that simplifies remote sensing image analysis by utilizing self-supervised learning strategies. It addresses the challenges of large datasets, computing resources, and coding skills often associated with deep learning. By leveraging foundation models and offering a streamlined interface, IAMAP enables non-specialists to extract features, reduce dimensionality, perform clustering, generate feature similarity maps, and validate machine learning models for prediction without the need for GPU capacity or extensive reference datasets. This democratization of deep learning methods allows for efficient and energy-conscious utilization of recent advancements in remote sensing technology. <div>
arXiv:2508.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing has entered a new era with the rapid development of artificial intelligence approaches. However, the implementation of deep learning has largely remained restricted to specialists and has been impractical because it often requires (i) large reference datasets for model training and validation; (ii) substantial computing resources; and (iii) strong coding skills. Here, we introduce IAMAP, a user-friendly QGIS plugin that addresses these three challenges in an easy yet flexible way. IAMAP builds on recent advancements in self-supervised learning strategies, which now provide robust feature extractors, often referred to as foundation models. These generalist models can often be reliably used in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios (i.e., with little to no fine-tuning). IAMAP's interface allows users to streamline several key steps in remote sensing image analysis: (i) extracting image features using a wide range of deep learning architectures; (ii) reducing dimensionality with built-in algorithms; (iii) performing clustering on features or their reduced representations; (iv) generating feature similarity maps; and (v) calibrating and validating supervised machine learning models for prediction. By enabling non-AI specialists to leverage the high-quality features provided by recent deep learning approaches without requiring GPU capacity or extensive reference datasets, IAMAP contributes to the democratization of computationally efficient and energy-conscious deep learning methods.

Abstract: Solving high-frequency oscillatory partial differential equations (PDEs) is a critical challenge in scientific computing, with applications in fluid mechanics, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic wave propagation. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) suffer from spectral bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency solution components.  We introduce Separated-Variable Spectral Neural Networks (SV-SNN), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by integrating separation of variables with adaptive spectral methods. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) decomposition of multivariate functions into univariate function products, enabling independent spatial and temporal networks; (2) adaptive Fourier spectral features with learnable frequency parameters for high-frequency capture; and (3) theoretical framework based on singular value decomposition to quantify spectral bias. Comprehensive evaluation on benchmark problems including Heat equation, Helmholtz equation, Poisson equations and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrates that SV-SNN achieves 1-3 orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy while reducing parameter count by over 90\% and training time by 60\%. These results establish SV-SNN as an effective solution to the spectral bias problem in neural PDE solving. The implementation will be made publicly available upon acceptance at https://github.com/xgxgnpu/SV-SNN.

Abstract: Multi-scale decomposition architectures have emerged as predominant methodologies in time series forecasting. However, real-world time series exhibit noise interference across different scales, while heterogeneous information distribution among frequency components at varying scales leads to suboptimal multi-scale representation. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Parseval's theorem, we propose a KAN based adaptive Frequency Selection learning architecture (KFS) to address these challenges. This framework tackles prediction challenges stemming from cross-scale noise interference and complex pattern modeling through its FreK module, which performs energy-distribution-based dominant frequency selection in the spectral domain. Simultaneously, KAN enables sophisticated pattern representation while timestamp embedding alignment synchronizes temporal representations across scales. The feature mixing module then fuses scale-specific patterns with aligned temporal features. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that KT achieves state-of-the-art performance as a simple yet effective architecture.

Abstract: The growing threat of low-cost kamikaze drone swarms poses a critical challenge to modern defense systems demanding rapid and strategic decision-making to prioritize interceptions across multiple effectors and high-value target zones. In this work, we present a case study demonstrating the practical advantages of reinforcement learning in addressing this challenge. We introduce a high-fidelity simulation environment that captures realistic operational constraints, within which a decision-level reinforcement learning agent learns to coordinate multiple effectors for optimal interception prioritization. Operating in a discrete action space, the agent selects which drone to engage per effector based on observed state features such as positions, classes, and effector status. We evaluate the learned policy against a handcrafted rule-based baseline across hundreds of simulated attack scenarios. The reinforcement learning based policy consistently achieves lower average damage and higher defensive efficiency in protecting critical zones. This case study highlights the potential of reinforcement learning as a strategic layer within defense architectures, enhancing resilience without displacing existing control systems. All code and simulation assets are publicly released for full reproducibility, and a video demonstration illustrates the policy's qualitative behavior.

Summary:
Operator learning has been a powerful method for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) being commonly used. However, FNOs have scalability issues and lack uncertainty quantification capabilities. In this study, the researchers introduce DINOZAUR, a diffusion-based neural operator with built-in uncertainty quantification inspired by the heat kernel structure. DINOZAUR reduces parameter count and memory usage by replacing dense tensor multipliers with dimensionality-independent diffusion multipliers with learnable time parameters. By defining priors over these parameters, DINOZAUR functions as a Bayesian neural operator, producing spatially correlated outputs and reliable uncertainty estimates. The method outperforms traditional approaches in various PDE benchmarks while efficiently providing uncertainty quantification. DINOZAUR offers a promising solution for tackling scalability challenges and fulfilling the crucial need for uncertainty quantification in scientific and engineering applications.

arXiv:2508.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator learning is a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential equations, with Fourier Neural Operators serving as a widely adopted foundation. However, FNOs face significant scalability challenges due to overparameterization and offer no native uncertainty quantification -- a key requirement for reliable scientific and engineering applications. Instead, neural operators rely on post hoc UQ methods that ignore geometric inductive biases. In this work, we introduce DINOZAUR: a diffusion-based neural operator parametrization with uncertainty quantification. Inspired by the structure of the heat kernel, DINOZAUR replaces the dense tensor multiplier in FNOs with a dimensionality-independent diffusion multiplier that has a single learnable time parameter per channel, drastically reducing parameter count and memory footprint without compromising predictive performance. By defining priors over those time parameters, we cast DINOZAUR as a Bayesian neural operator to yield spatially correlated outputs and calibrated uncertainty estimates. Our method achieves competitive or superior performance across several PDE benchmarks while providing efficient uncertainty quantification.

Summary:
TrajSurv is a model developed for trustworthy survival prediction using longitudinal EHR data. It utilizes a neural controlled differential equation to extract continuous-time latent states from irregularly sampled clinical features, forming continuous latent trajectories. TrajSurv ensures that the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression through time-aware contrastive learning. It transparently links clinical progression to survival outcomes by explaining changes in clinical features through a learned vector field and clustering latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on real-world medical datasets demonstrate TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and superior transparency compared to existing deep learning methods.

Abstract: Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and superior transparency over existing deep learning methods.

<div> Dynamic Prototypes, Graph Anomaly Detection, Evolving Patterns, Domain Adaptation, Self-Supervised Learning

Summary: 
Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is crucial for identifying anomalies in evolving graphs across various domains. Generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models, while effective on static graphs, struggle with dynamic graphs and lack labeled data for various domains. To address these challenges, a new DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) is proposed. DP-DGAD extracts evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns from temporal ego-graphs, selectively updating a memory buffer to capture domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns. An anomaly scorer compares incoming data with dynamic prototypes to detect anomalies, and confidence-based pseudo-labeling enables self-supervised adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments across ten real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showcasing the effectiveness of DP-DGAD in capturing evolving anomalies and adapting to new domains.

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is essential for identifying anomalies in evolving graphs across domains such as finance, traffic, and social networks. Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown promising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and generalize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to capture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous emergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge generalist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and domain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve temporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a DGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and domain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e., evolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal ego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively updated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new domain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with dynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally, DP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised adaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different domains.

<div> Keywords: resource adequacy, wind power scenarios, spatial correlation, temporal correlation, dynamic factor model

Summary:
This study focuses on synthesizing multiple long-term wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms by incorporating spatio-temporal features. The researchers utilize a combination of the Generalized Dynamic Factor Model (GDFM) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to capture spatial and temporal correlations, waveforms, marginal distributions, power spectral densities, and statistical characteristics of wind power scenarios. By using the GAN to extract dynamic factors with temporal information from observation data and applying them in the GDFM, the proposed approach improves the representation of plausible waveforms compared to alternative methods. Numerical tests conducted on wind power scenarios from Australia demonstrate that the combined GDFM and GAN approach outperforms other methods in capturing the statistical characteristics of actual wind power scenarios. This innovative method provides a more accurate and realistic synthesis of wind power scenarios for resource adequacy studies.

Abstract: For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN, we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.

Abstract: The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT and SciBERT), to classify clinical notes into these two diagnoses. Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling, Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling techniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models. However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The Decision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of different model architectures and data balancing methods.

Abstract: The application of message-passing Graph Neural Networks has been a breakthrough for important network science problems. However, the competitive performance often relies on using handcrafted structural features as inputs, which increases computational cost and introduces bias into the otherwise purely data-driven network representations. Here, we eliminate the need for handcrafted features by introducing an attention mechanism and utilizing message-iteration profiles, in addition to an effective algorithmic approach to generate a structurally diverse training set of small synthetic networks. Thereby, we build an expressive message-passing framework and use it to efficiently solve the NP-hard problem of Network Dismantling, virtually equivalent to vital node identification, with significant real-world applications. Trained solely on diversified synthetic networks, our proposed model -- MIND: Message Iteration Network Dismantler -- generalizes to large, unseen real networks with millions of nodes, outperforming state-of-the-art network dismantling methods. Increased efficiency and generalizability of the proposed model can be leveraged beyond dismantling in a range of complex network problems.

Abstract: Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from interactions with an unknown environment enables the synthesis of robust policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and learning r-MDPs based on factored state-space representations that leverage the independence between model uncertainty across system components. Although policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation problems, we show how to reformulate these into tractable linear programs. Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model representations directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample efficiency, producing more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We introduce JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON-Bag) as a method to generically represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions and apply Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) as distance metric for them. Using a prototype-based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games -- \textit{7 Wonders}, \textit{Dominion}, \textit{Sea Salt and Paper}, \textit{Can't Stop}, \textit{Connect4}, \textit{Dots and boxes} -- each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories.
  Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted features in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents' policies.

<title>Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement for Noisy Label Domain Adaptation Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00716</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) facilitates knowledge transfer from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs by learning domain-invariant representations, which is essential in applications such as molecular property prediction and social network analysis. However, most existing GDA methods rely on the assumption of clean source labels, which rarely holds in real-world scenarios where annotation noise is pervasive. This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy.

Abstract: Machine learning development critically depends on access to high-quality data. However, increasing restrictions due to privacy, proprietary interests, and ethical concerns have created significant barriers to data accessibility. Synthetic data offers a viable solution by enabling safe, broad data usage without compromising sensitive information. This paper presents the MOSTLY AI Synthetic Data Software Development Kit (SDK), an open-source toolkit designed specifically for synthesizing high-quality tabular data. The SDK integrates robust features such as differential privacy guarantees, fairness-aware data generation, and automated quality assurance into a flexible and accessible Python interface. Leveraging the TabularARGN autoregressive framework, the SDK supports diverse data types and complex multi-table and sequential datasets, delivering competitive performance with notable improvements in speed and usability. Currently deployed both as a cloud service and locally installable software, the SDK has seen rapid adoption, highlighting its practicality in addressing real-world data bottlenecks and promoting widespread data democratization.

Abstract: Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally challenging-particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a high-fidelity dataset generated through stratified sampling is used to train a deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost-effective and highly correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks and deep ensemble methods have been proposed for uncertainty quantification; however, they are computationally intensive and require large storage. By utilizing a single deterministic model, we can solve the above issue. We propose an effective method based on feature space density to quantify uncertainty for distributional shifts and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Specifically, we leverage the information potential field derived from kernel density estimation to approximate the feature space density of the training set. By comparing this density with the feature space representation of test samples, we can effectively determine whether a distributional shift has occurred. Experiments were conducted on a 2D synthetic dataset (Two Moons and Three Spirals) as well as an OOD detection task (CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN). The results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in tabular data remains challenging due to complex feature interactions and the scarcity of anomalous examples. Denoising autoencoders rely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data distributions. Diffusion models introduce scheduled noise and iterative denoising, but lack explicit reconstruction mappings. We propose the Diffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates diffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding process to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from ADBench. Our method outperforms in semi-supervised settings and achieves competitive results in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65% (9%) and ROC-AUC by 16% (6%) over state-of-the-art autoencoder (diffusion) model baselines. We observed that higher noise levels benefit unsupervised training, while lower noise with linear scheduling is optimal in semi-supervised settings. These findings underscore the importance of principled noise strategies in tabular anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Quantum Computing and Machine Learning have increased attention to Quantum Machine Learning (QML), which aims to develop machine learning models by exploiting the quantum computing paradigm. One of the widely used models in this area is the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), a hybrid model where the quantum circuit handles data inference while classical optimization adjusts the parameters of the circuit. The quantum circuit consists of an encoding layer, which loads data into the circuit, and a template circuit, known as the ansatz, responsible for processing the data. This work involves performing an analysis by considering both Amplitude- and Angle-encoding models, and examining how the type of rotational gate applied affects the classification performance of the model. This comparison is carried out by training the different models on two datasets, Wine and Diabetes, and evaluating their performance. The study demonstrates that, under identical model topologies, the difference in accuracy between the best and worst models ranges from 10% to 30%, with differences reaching up to 41%. Moreover, the results highlight how the choice of rotational gates used in encoding can significantly impact the model's classification performance. The findings confirm that the embedding represents a hyperparameter for VQC models.

Abstract: Academic performance depends on a multivariable nexus of socio-academic and financial factors. This study investigates these influences to develop effective strategies for optimizing students' CGPA. To achieve this, we reviewed various literature to identify key influencing factors and constructed an initial hypothetical causal graph based on the findings. Additionally, an online survey was conducted, where 1,050 students participated, providing comprehensive data for analysis. Rigorous data preprocessing techniques, including cleaning and visualization, ensured data quality before analysis. Causal analysis validated the relationships among variables, offering deeper insights into their direct and indirect effects on CGPA. Regression models were implemented for CGPA prediction, while classification models categorized students based on performance levels. Ridge Regression demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, achieving a Mean Absolute Error of 0.12 and a Mean Squared Error of 0.023. Random Forest outperformed in classification, attaining an F1-score near perfection and an accuracy of 98.68%. Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Interpret enhanced model interpretability, highlighting critical factors such as study hours, scholarships, parental education, and prior academic performance. The study culminated in the development of a web-based application that provides students with personalized insights, allowing them to predict academic performance, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions to enhance their outcomes.

Abstract: Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the Baseline.

Abstract: Indonesia is rich in languages and scripts. However, most NLP progress has been made using romanized text. In this paper, we present NusaAksara, a novel public benchmark for Indonesian languages that includes their original scripts. Our benchmark covers both text and image modalities and encompasses diverse tasks such as image segmentation, OCR, transliteration, translation, and language identification. Our data is constructed by human experts through rigorous steps. NusaAksara covers 8 scripts across 7 languages, including low-resource languages not commonly seen in NLP benchmarks. Although unsupported by Unicode, the Lampung script is included in this dataset. We benchmark our data across several models, from LLMs and VLMs such as GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Aya 23 to task-specific systems such as PP-OCR and LangID, and show that most NLP technologies cannot handle Indonesia's local scripts, with many achieving near-zero performance.

Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are designed to meet the hyper-reliable and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements of safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the 6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. The proposed method improves information freshness and overall network reliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination. The findings reveal the potential of HAPS-supported solutions, combined with DDPG-based learning, for efficient AoI-aware resource allocation in platoon-based autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding: ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02% accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST, while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces. This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that leverages modern neural architectures.

Abstract: Modern recommenders describe each item with hundreds of sparse semantic tags, yet most quantum pipelines still map one qubit per tag, demanding well beyond one hundred qubits, far out of reach for current noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and prone to deep, error-amplifying circuits. We close this gap with a three-stage hybrid machine learning algorithm that compresses tag profiles, optimizes feature selection under a fixed qubit budget via QAOA, and scores recommendations with a Quantum semi-Random Forest (QsRF) built on just five qubits, while performing similarly to the state-of-the-art methods. Leveraging SVD sketching and k-means, we learn a 1000-atom dictionary ($>$97 \% variance), then solve a 2020 QUBO via depth-3 QAOA to select 5 atoms. A 100-tree QsRF trained on these codes matches full-feature baselines on ICM-150/500.

Abstract: Large-scale civil structures, such as bridges, pipelines, and offshore platforms, are vital to modern infrastructure, where unexpected failures can cause significant economic and safety repercussions. Although finite element (FE) modeling is widely used for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM), its high computational cost and the complexity of inverse FE analysis, where low dimensional sensor data must map onto high-dimensional displacement or stress fields pose ongoing challenges. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum classical multilayer perceptron (QMLP) framework to tackle these issues and facilitate swift updates to digital twins across a range of structural applications.
  Our approach embeds sensor data using symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices and polynomial features, yielding a representation well suited to quantum processing. A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) transforms these features, and the resultant quantum outputs feed into a classical neural network for final inference. By fusing quantum capabilities with classical modeling, the QMLP handles large scale inverse FE mapping while preserving computational viability.
  Through extensive experiments on a bridge, we demonstrate that the QMLP achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0000000000316, outperforming purely classical baselines with a large margin. These findings confirm the potential of quantum-enhanced methods for real time SHM, establishing a pathway toward more efficient, scalable digital twins that can robustly monitor and diagnose structural integrity in near real time.

Abstract: AI-native 6G networks promise unprecedented automation and performance by embedding machine-learning models throughout the radio access and core segments of the network. However, the non-stationary nature of wireless environments due to infrastructure changes, user mobility, and emerging traffic patterns, induces concept drifts that can quickly degrade these model accuracies. Existing methods in general are very domain specific, or struggle with certain type of concept drift. In this paper, we introduce two unsupervised, model-agnostic, batch concept drift detectors. Both methods compute an expected-utility score to decide when concept drift occurred and if model retraining is warranted, without requiring ground-truth labels after deployment. We validate our framework on two real-world wireless use cases in outdoor fingerprinting for localization and for link-anomaly detection, and demonstrate that both methods are outperforming classical detectors such as ADWIN, DDM, CUSUM by 20-40 percentage points. Additionally, they achieve an F1-score of 0.94 and 1.00 in correctly triggering retraining alarm, thus reducing the false alarm rate by up to 20 percentage points compared to the best classical detectors.

Abstract: Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$ principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore, writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based denoising.
  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$ (determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the classical processing component.

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.

<title>Riemannian Optimization for Distance Geometry: A Study of Convergence, Robustness, and Incoherence</title>

Abstract: The problem of recovering a configuration of points from partial pairwise distances, referred to as the Euclidean Distance Geometry (EDG) problem, arises in a broad range of applications, including sensor network localization, molecular conformation, and manifold learning. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian optimization framework for solving the EDG problem by formulating it as a low-rank matrix completion task over the space of positive semi-definite Gram matrices. The available distance measurements are encoded as expansion coefficients in a non-orthogonal basis, and optimization over the Gram matrix implicitly enforces geometric consistency through the triangle inequality, a structure inherited from classical multidimensional scaling. Under a Bernoulli sampling model for observed distances, we prove that Riemannian gradient descent on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices locally converges linearly with high probability when the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq \mathcal{O}(\nu^2 r^2 \log(n)/n)$, where $\nu$ is an EDG-specific incoherence parameter. Furthermore, we provide an initialization candidate using a one-step hard thresholding procedure that yields convergence, provided the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq \mathcal{O}(\nu r^{3/2} \log^{3/4}(n)/n^{1/4})$. A key technical contribution of this work is the analysis of a symmetric linear operator arising from a dual basis expansion in the non-orthogonal basis, which requires a novel application of the Hanson--Wright inequality to establish an optimal restricted isometry property in the presence of coupled terms. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm achieves competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we propose a novel notion of matrix incoherence tailored to the EDG setting and provide robustness guarantees for our method.

Abstract: We propose a new deflation strategy to accelerate the convergence of the preconditioned conjugate gradient(PCG) method for solving parametric large-scale linear systems of equations. Unlike traditional deflation techniques that rely on eigenvector approximations or recycled Krylov subspaces, we generate the deflation subspaces using operator learning, specifically the Deep Operator Network~(DeepONet). To this aim, we introduce two complementary approaches for assembling the deflation operators. The first approach approximates near-null space vectors of the discrete PDE operator using the basis functions learned by the DeepONet. The second approach directly leverages solutions predicted by the DeepONet. To further enhance convergence, we also propose several strategies for prescribing the sparsity pattern of the deflation operator. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments encompassing steady-state, time-dependent, scalar, and vector-valued problems posed on both structured and unstructured geometries is presented and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed DeepONet-based deflated PCG method, as well as its generalization across a wide range of model parameters and problem resolutions.

Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms, showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields, including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising. Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters (7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical application in domains such as security and surveillance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven motion-planning framework for nonlinear systems that constructs a sequence of overlapping invariant polytopes. Around each randomly sampled waypoint, the algorithm identifies a convex admissible region and solves data-driven linear-matrix-inequality problems to learn several ellipsoidal invariant sets together with their local state-feedback gains. The convex hull of these ellipsoids, still invariant under a piece-wise-affine controller obtained by interpolating the gains, is then approximated by a polytope. Safe transitions between nodes are ensured by verifying the intersection of consecutive convex-hull polytopes and introducing an intermediate node for a smooth transition. Control gains are interpolated in real time via simplex-based interpolation, keeping the state inside the invariant polytopes throughout the motion. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on system dynamics models, our method requires only data to compute safe regions and design state-feedback controllers. The approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving safe, dynamically feasible paths for complex nonlinear systems.

Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance, averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We provide the implementation and dataset at https://github.com/tomek1911/GEPAR3D.

Abstract: Power is a key concept in AI safety: power-seeking as an instrumental goal, sudden or gradual disempowerment of humans, power balance in human-AI interaction and international AI governance. At the same time, power as the ability to pursue diverse goals is essential for wellbeing.
  This paper explores the idea of promoting both safety and wellbeing by forcing AI agents explicitly to empower humans and to manage the power balance between humans and AI agents in a desirable way. Using a principled, partially axiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective function that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of human power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social norms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.
  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or approximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given world model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric in a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental sub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly maximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a beneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct utility-based objectives.

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2) bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product, disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers (useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal" functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and (hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces) and to multigrid numerical methods.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex, multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks, instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different tabular representations and formats.

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its inherently on-policy strategy with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Further, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel approach that synergizes internal exploitation (i.e., Thinking) with external data (i.e., Learning) to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components: Multiple Importance Sampling to address for distributional mismatch from external data, and an Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. The results show that RL-PLUS achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing RLVR methods on six math reasoning benchmarks and exhibits superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks. It also achieves consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements ranging from 21.1\% to 69.2\%. Moreover, Pass@k curves across multiple benchmarks indicate that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem states that any continuous multivariable function can be exactly represented as a finite superposition of continuous single variable functions. Subsequent simplifications of this representation involve expressing these functions as parameterized sums of a smaller number of unique monotonic functions. These developments led to the proof of the universal approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron networks with sigmoidal activations, forming the alternative theoretical direction of most modern neural networks.
  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been recently proposed as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons. KANs feature learnable nonlinear activations applied directly to input values, modeled as weighted sums of basis spline functions. This approach replaces the linear transformations and sigmoidal post-activations used in traditional perceptrons. Subsequent works have explored alternatives to spline-based activations. In this work, we propose a novel KAN variant by replacing both the inner and outer functions in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with weighted sinusoidal functions of learnable frequencies. Inspired by simplifications introduced by Lorentz and Sprecher, we fix the phases of the sinusoidal activations to linearly spaced constant values and provide a proof of its theoretical validity. We also conduct numerical experiments to evaluate its performance on a range of multivariable functions, comparing it with fixed-frequency Fourier transform methods and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). We show that it outperforms the fixed-frequency Fourier transform and achieves comparable performance to MLPs.

Abstract: This article presents, for the first time, the application of diffusion models for generating jet images corresponding to proton-proton collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The kinematic variables of quark, gluon, W-boson, Z-boson, and top quark jets from the JetNet simulation dataset are mapped to two-dimensional image representations. Diffusion models are trained on these images to learn the spatial distribution of jet constituents. We compare the performance of score-based diffusion models and consistency models in accurately generating class-conditional jet images. Unlike approaches based on latent distributions, our method operates directly in image space. The fidelity of the generated images is evaluated using several metrics, including the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), which demonstrates that consistency models achieve higher fidelity and generation stability compared to score-based diffusion models. These advancements offer significant improvements in computational efficiency and generation accuracy, providing valuable tools for High Energy Physics (HEP) research.

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful tool for graph representation learning. Due to the recursive neighborhood aggregations employed by GCNs, efficient training methods suffer from a lack of theoretical guarantees or are missing important practical elements from modern deep learning algorithms, such as adaptivity and momentum. In this paper, we present several neighbor-sampling (NS) based Adam-type stochastic methods for solving a nonconvex GCN training problem. We utilize the control variate technique proposed by [1] to reduce the stochastic error caused by neighbor sampling. Under standard assumptions for Adam-type methods, we show that our methods enjoy the optimal convergence rate. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical experiments on node classification tasks with several benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate superior performance of our methods over classic NS-based SGD that also uses the control-variate technique, especially for large-scale graph datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/RPI-OPT/CV-ADAM-GNN .

Abstract: Explanations are crucial for building trustworthy AI systems, but a gap often exists between the explanations provided by models and those needed by users. To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to generate user-centered explanations. Our approach employs a three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse natural language processing tasks but face resource demands and limited context windows. Although techniques like pruning, quantization, and token dropping can mitigate these issues, their efficacy in long-context scenarios and system evaluation remains underexplored. This paper systematically benchmarks these optimizations, characterizing memory usage, latency, and throughput, and studies how these methods impact the quality of text generation. We first analyze individual optimization methods for two LLM architectures supporting long context and then systematically evaluate combinations of these techniques to assess how this deeper analysis impacts performance metrics. We subsequently study the scalability of individual optimization methods on a larger variant with 70 billion-parameter model. Our novel insights reveal that naive combination inference optimization algorithms can adversely affect larger models due to compounded approximation errors, as compared to their smaller counterparts. Experiments show that relying solely on F1 obscures these effects by hiding precision-recall trade-offs in question answering tasks. By integrating system-level profiling with task-specific insights, this study helps LLM practitioners and researchers explore and balance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across tasks and hardware configurations.

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover, our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their prolonged, multi-stage nature and the sophistication of their operators. Traditional detection systems typically focus on identifying malicious activity in binary terms (benign or malicious) without accounting for the progression of an attack. However, effective response strategies depend on accurate inference of the attack's current stage, as countermeasures must be tailored to whether an adversary is in the early reconnaissance phase or actively conducting exploitation or exfiltration. This work addresses the problem of attack stage inference under uncertainty, with a focus on robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We propose a classification approach based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), which models predictive uncertainty by outputting parameters of a Dirichlet distribution over possible stages. This allows the system not only to predict the most likely stage of an attack but also to indicate when it is uncertain or the input lies outside the training distribution. Preliminary experiments in a simulated environment demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately infer the stage of an attack with calibrated confidence while effectively detecting OOD inputs, which may indicate changes in the attackers' tactics. These results support the feasibility of deploying uncertainty-aware models for staged threat detection in dynamic and adversarial environments.

Abstract: Deploying Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained edge devices for long-sequence tasks remains challenging due to the quadratic time complexity of self-attention and growing Key-Value (KV) cache demands. While existing KV cache optimizations improve memory efficiency, they often fail to reduce time to first token (TTFT) and may degrade performance through token pruning. Alternative sequence modeling architectures address some of these limitations, but typically require full retraining and lack infrastructure support. EdgeInfinite offers an efficient solution by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, maintaining quality while reducing both computational and memory costs, including improved TTFT. However, its instruction-following ability is limited, and it lacks mobile-specific optimizations. To address these issues, we propose EdgeInfinite-Instruct, which introduces a Segmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (S-SFT) strategy tailored to long-sequence tasks such as summarization and question answering. We further optimized EdgeInfinite-Instruct for efficient deployment on edge NPUs by employing fine-grained post-training quantization (PTQ) to reduce computational demands while maintaining accuracy, and by implementing a fixed-shape computation graph that balances memory usage and on-device efficiency through scenario-specific customization of input token and cache sizes. Experiments on long-context benchmarks and real-world mobile tasks show that our approach improves domain-specific performance while maintaining efficiency on NPU-accelerated edge devices.

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

<title>Multi-Layer Attention is the Amplifier of Demonstration Effectiveness</title>

Abstract: Numerous studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of in-context learning (ICL) effectiveness to inspire the design of related methods. However, existing work predominantly assumes the effectiveness of the demonstrations provided within ICL, while many research indicates that not all demonstrations are effective, failing to yielding any performance improvement during ICL. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the reasons behind demonstration ineffectiveness. Our analysis is based on gradient flow and linear self-attention models. By setting the gradient flow to zero, we deduce that a demonstration becomes ineffective if its information has either been learned by the model or is irrelevant to the user query. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in multi-layer models, the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is amplified with layer increasing, causing the model to focus more on effective ones. Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus on the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the model has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which leverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of the gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as the criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We validate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream datasets. The experimental results confirm that the disparity in effectiveness among demonstrations is magnified as the model layer increases, substantiating our derivations. Moreover, GradS achieves a relative improvement of $6.8\%$ on average over the strongest baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Loop invariants are essential for proving the correctness of programs with loops. Developing loop invariants is challenging, and fully automatic synthesis cannot be guaranteed for arbitrary programs. Some approaches have been proposed to synthesize loop invariants using symbolic techniques and more recently using neural approaches. These approaches are able to correctly synthesize loop invariants only for subsets of standard benchmarks. In this work, we investigate whether modern, reasoning-optimized large language models can do better. We integrate OpenAI's O1, O1-mini, and O3-mini into a tightly coupled generate-and-check pipeline with the Z3 SMT solver, using solver counterexamples to iteratively guide invariant refinement. We use Code2Inv benchmark, which provides C programs along with their formal preconditions and postconditions. On this benchmark of 133 tasks, our framework achieves 100% coverage (133 out of 133), outperforming the previous best of 107 out of 133, while requiring only 1-2 model proposals per instance and 14-55 seconds of wall-clock time. These results demonstrate that LLMs possess latent logical reasoning capabilities which can help automate loop invariant synthesis. While our experiments target C-specific programs, this approach should be generalizable to other imperative languages.

Abstract: Type annotations in Python enhance maintainability and error detection. However, generating these annotations manually is error prone and requires extra effort. Traditional automation approaches like static analysis, machine learning, and deep learning struggle with limited type vocabularies, behavioral over approximation, and reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for generating type annotations in Python. We develop a generate check repair pipeline: the LLM proposes annotations guided by a Concrete Syntax Tree representation, a static type checker (Mypy) verifies them, and any errors are fed back for iterative refinement. We evaluate four LLM variants: GPT 4oMini, GPT 4.1mini (general-purpose), and O3Mini, O4Mini (reasoning optimized), on 6000 code snippets from the ManyTypes4Py benchmark. We first measure the proportion of code snippets annotated by LLMs for which MyPy reported no errors (i.e., consistent results): GPT 4oMini achieved consistency on 65.9% of cases (34.1% inconsistent), while GPT 4.1mini, O3Mini, and O4Mini each reached approximately 88.6% consistency (around 11.4% failures). To measure annotation quality, we then compute exact-match and base-type match accuracies over all 6000 snippets: GPT 4.1mini and O3Mini perform the best, achieving up to 70.5% exact match and 79.1% base type accuracy, requiring under one repair iteration on average. Our results demonstrate that general-purpose and reasoning optimized LLMs, without any task specific fine tuning or additional training can be effective in generating consistent type annotations.They perform competitively with traditional deep learning techniques which require large labeled dataset for training. While our work focuses on Python, the pipeline can be extended to other optionally typed imperative languages like Ruby

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in graph-based learning by propagating information among neighbor nodes via predefined aggregation mechanisms. However, such fixed schemes often suffer from two key limitations. First, they cannot handle the imbalance in node informativeness -- some nodes are rich in information, while others remain sparse. Second, predefined message passing primarily leverages local structural similarity while ignoring global semantic relationships across the graph, limiting the model's ability to capture distant but relevant information. We propose Retrieval-augmented Graph Agentic Network (ReaGAN), an agent-based framework that empowers each node with autonomous, node-level decision-making. Each node acts as an agent that independently plans its next action based on its internal memory, enabling node-level planning and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows nodes to access semantically relevant content and build global relationships in the graph. ReaGAN achieves competitive performance under few-shot in-context settings using a frozen LLM backbone without fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of agentic planning and local-global retrieval in graph learning.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research. Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs, highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological monitoring applications.

Abstract: The training of modern large-language models requires an increasingly amount of computation power and time. Even smaller variants, such as small-language models (SLMs), take several days to train in the best-case scenarios, often requiring multiple GPUs. This paper explores methods to train and evaluate decoder-only transformer-based language models in hours instead of days/weeks. We introduces \textit{PaPaformer}, a decoder-only transformer architecture variant, whose lower-dimensional parallel paths are combined into larger model. The paper shows that these lower-dimensional paths can be trained individually with different types of training data and then combined into one larger model. This method gives the option to reduce the total number of model parameters and the training time with increasing performance. Moreover, the use of parallel path structure opens interesting possibilities to customize paths to accommodate specific task requirements.

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs. Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects. We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.

Abstract: Accurate confidence estimation is essential for trustworthy large language models (LLMs) systems, as it empowers the user to determine when to trust outputs and enables reliable deployment in safety-critical applications. Current confidence estimation methods for LLMs neglect the relevance between responses and contextual information, a crucial factor in output quality evaluation, particularly in scenarios where background knowledge is provided. To bridge this gap, we propose CRUX (Context-aware entropy Reduction and Unified consistency eXamination), the first framework that integrates context faithfulness and consistency for confidence estimation via two novel metrics. First, contextual entropy reduction represents data uncertainty with the information gain through contrastive sampling with and without context. Second, unified consistency examination captures potential model uncertainty through the global consistency of the generated answers with and without context. Experiments across three benchmark datasets (CoQA, SQuAD, QuAC) and two domain-specific datasets (BioASQ, EduQG) demonstrate CRUX's effectiveness, achieving the highest AUROC than existing baselines.

Abstract: The generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment across various applications. However, this increased adoption has introduced several security threats, notably in the forms of jailbreaking and data leakage attacks. Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), while enhancing context-awareness in LLM responses, has inadvertently introduced vulnerabilities that can result in the leakage of sensitive information. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce a methodology to analyze historical interaction data from an LLM system, enabling the generation of usage maps categorized by topics (including adversarial interactions). This approach further provides forensic insights for tracking the evolution of jailbreaking attack patterns. Second, we propose LeakSealer, a model-agnostic framework that combines static analysis for forensic insights with dynamic defenses in a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) pipeline. This technique identifies topic groups and detects anomalous patterns, allowing for proactive defense mechanisms. We empirically evaluate LeakSealer under two scenarios: (1) jailbreak attempts, employing a public benchmark dataset, and (2) PII leakage, supported by a curated dataset of labeled LLM interactions. In the static setting, LeakSealer achieves the highest precision and recall on the ToxicChat dataset when identifying prompt injection. In the dynamic setting, PII leakage detection achieves an AUPRC of $0.97$, significantly outperforming baselines such as Llama Guard.

Abstract: Conditioning, the central operation in Bayesian statistics, is formalised by the notion of disintegration of measures. However, due to the implicit nature of their definition, constructing disintegrations is often difficult. A folklore result in machine learning conflates the construction of a disintegration with the restriction of probability density functions onto the subset of events that are consistent with a given observation. We provide a comprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct disintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on differentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple example in which the restricted density and the disintegration density drastically disagree. Motivated by applications in approximate Bayesian inference and Bayesian inverse problems, we further study the modes of disintegrations. We show that the recently introduced notion of a "conditional mode" does not coincide in general with the modes of the conditional measure obtained through disintegration, but rather the modes of the restricted measure. We also discuss the implications of the discrepancy between the two measures in practice, advocating for the utility of both approaches depending on the modelling context.

Abstract: Existing AIG (AI-generated) text detectors struggle in real-world settings despite succeeding in internal testing, suggesting that they may not be robust enough. We rigorously examine the machine-learning procedure to build these detectors to address this. Most current AIG text detection datasets focus on zero-shot generations, but little work has been done on few-shot or one-shot generations, where LLMs are given human texts as an example. In response, we introduce the Diverse Adversarial Corpus of Texts Yielded from Language models (DACTYL), a challenging AIG text detection dataset focusing on one-shot/few-shot generations. We also include texts from domain-specific continued-pre-trained (CPT) language models, where we fully train all parameters using a memory-efficient optimization approach. Many existing AIG text detectors struggle significantly on our dataset, indicating a potential vulnerability to one-shot/few-shot and CPT-generated texts. We also train our own classifiers using two approaches: standard binary cross-entropy (BCE) optimization and a more recent approach, deep X-risk optimization (DXO). While BCE-trained classifiers marginally outperform DXO classifiers on the DACTYL test set, the latter excels on out-of-distribution (OOD) texts. In our mock deployment scenario in student essay detection with an OOD student essay dataset, the best DXO classifier outscored the best BCE-trained classifier by 50.56 macro-F1 score points at the lowest false positive rates for both. Our results indicate that DXO classifiers generalize better without overfitting to the test set. Our experiments highlight several areas of improvement for AIG text detectors.

Abstract: Face Recognition Systems that operate in unconstrained environments capture images under varying conditions,such as inconsistent lighting, or diverse face poses. These challenges require including a Face Detection module that regresses bounding boxes and landmark coordinates for proper Face Alignment. This paper shows the effectiveness of Object Generation Attacks on Face Detection, dubbed Face Generation Attacks, and demonstrates for the first time a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

<title>Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality: A Unified Framework for Causal Time Series Inference across Frequencies</title>

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in time series is fundamental to many domains, including neuroscience, economics, and behavioral science. Granger causality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time series. Typically, Granger causality frameworks have a strong fix-lag assumption between cause and effect, which is often unrealistic in complex systems. While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses this limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time lags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal interactions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands. For example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region with a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations. In this work, we formalize Multi-Band Variable-Lag Granger Causality (MB-VLGC) and propose a novel framework that generalizes traditional VLGC by explicitly modeling frequency-dependent causal delays. We provide a formal definition of MB-VLGC, demonstrate its theoretical soundness, and propose an efficient inference pipeline. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming its broad applicability to any type of time series data. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven adaptive learning systems are reshaping education through data-driven adaptation of learning experiences. Yet many of these systems lack transparency, offering limited insight into how decisions are made. Most explainable AI (XAI) techniques focus on technical outputs but neglect user roles and comprehension. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates traditional XAI techniques with generative AI models and user personalisation to generate multimodal, personalised explanations tailored to user needs. We redefine explainability as a dynamic communication process tailored to user roles and learning goals. We outline the framework's design, key XAI limitations in education, and research directions on accuracy, fairness, and personalisation. Our aim is to move towards explainable AI that enhances transparency while supporting user-centred experiences.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine has enabled impressive capabilities, yet a critical gap remains in their ability to perform systematic, transparent, and verifiable reasoning, a cornerstone of clinical practice. This has catalyzed a shift from single-step answer generation to the development of LLMs explicitly designed for medical reasoning. This paper provides the first systematic review of this emerging field. We propose a taxonomy of reasoning enhancement techniques, categorized into training-time strategies (e.g., supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) and test-time mechanisms (e.g., prompt engineering, multi-agent systems). We analyze how these techniques are applied across different data modalities (text, image, code) and in key clinical applications such as diagnosis, education, and treatment planning. Furthermore, we survey the evolution of evaluation benchmarks from simple accuracy metrics to sophisticated assessments of reasoning quality and visual interpretability. Based on an analysis of 60 seminal studies from 2022-2025, we conclude by identifying critical challenges, including the faithfulness-plausibility gap and the need for native multimodal reasoning, and outlining future directions toward building efficient, robust, and sociotechnically responsible medical AI.

Abstract: Social media platforms today strive to improve user experience through AI recommendations, yet the value of such recommendations vanishes as users do not understand the reasons behind them. This issue arises because explainability in social media is general and lacks alignment with user-specific needs. In this vision paper, we outline a user-segmented and context-aware explanation layer by proposing a visual explanation system with diverse explanation methods. The proposed system is framed by the variety of user needs and contexts, showing explanations in different visualized forms, including a technically detailed version for AI experts and a simplified one for lay users. Our framework is the first to jointly adapt explanation style (visual vs. numeric) and granularity (expert vs. lay) inside a single pipeline. A public pilot with 30 X users will validate its impact on decision-making and trust.

Abstract: Legal precedent retrieval is a cornerstone of the common law system, governed by the principle of stare decisis, which demands consistency in judicial decisions. However, the growing complexity and volume of legal documents challenge traditional retrieval methods. TraceRetriever mirrors real-world legal search by operating with limited case information, extracting only rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining initial results through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking. Rhetorical annotations are generated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF classifier trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets, TraceRetriever addresses growing document volume challenges while aligning with practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foundation for precedent retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is available.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law, aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance interpretability in legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by providing models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically retrieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in predicting court decisions and generating legal explanations using a domain-specific pipeline tailored to the Indian legal system. We assess performance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic metrics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G-Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge significantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality.

Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Abstract: Generative agents powered by Large Language Models demonstrate human-like characteristics through sophisticated natural language interactions. Their ability to assume roles and personalities based on predefined character biographies has positioned them as cost-effective substitutes for human participants in social science research. This paper explores the validity of such persona-based agents in representing human populations; we recreate the HEXACO personality inventory experiment by surveying 310 GPT-4 powered agents, conducting factor analysis on their responses, and comparing these results to the original findings presented by Ashton, Lee, & Goldberg in 2004. Our results found 1) a coherent and reliable personality structure was recoverable from the agents' responses demonstrating partial alignment to the HEXACO framework. 2) the derived personality dimensions were consistent and reliable within GPT-4, when coupled with a sufficiently curated population, and 3) cross-model analysis revealed variability in personality profiling, suggesting model-specific biases and limitations. We discuss the practical considerations and challenges encountered during the experiment. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the potential benefits and limitations of using generative agents in social science research and provides useful guidance on designing consistent and representative agent personas to maximise coverage and representation of human personality traits.

<title>Agentic large language models improve retrieval-based radiology question answering</title>

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (AI), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN, segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Abstract: In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come with provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of problems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices performance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We address the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to improve its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems - for example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control (MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its worst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we characterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for classes of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting from a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the modifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our results apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for nonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for strongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over polyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on solving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to ill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of structured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time recurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously updating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) remains a central challenge in sequential decision-making, especially when dealing with large state spaces and long-term optimization criteria. A key step in Bellman dynamic programming algorithms is the policy evaluation, which becomes computationally demanding in infinite-horizon settings such as average-reward or discounted-reward formulations. In the context of Markov chains, aggregation and disaggregation techniques have for a long time been used to reduce complexity by exploiting structural decompositions. In this work, we extend these principles to a structured class of MDPs. We define the Single-Input Superstate Decomposable Markov Decision Process (SISDMDP), which combines Chiu's single-input decomposition with Robertazzi's single-cycle recurrence property. When a policy induces this structure, the resulting transition graph can be decomposed into interacting components with centralized recurrence. We develop an exact and efficient policy evaluation method based on this structure. This yields a scalable solution applicable to both average and discounted reward MDPs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving machine learning approach where private data remains local, enabling secure computations and the exchange of local model gradients between local clients and third-party parameter servers. However, recent findings reveal that privacy may be compromised and sensitive information potentially recovered from shared gradients. In this study, we offer detailed analysis and a novel perspective on understanding the gradient leakage problem. These theoretical works lead to a new gradient leakage defense technique that secures arbitrary model architectures using a private key-lock module. Only the locked gradient is transmitted to the parameter server for global model aggregation. Our proposed learning method is resistant to gradient leakage attacks, and the key-lock module is designed and trained to ensure that, without the private information of the key-lock module: a) reconstructing private training data from the shared gradient is infeasible; and b) the global model's inference performance is significantly compromised. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of why gradients can leak private information and provide theoretical proof of our method's effectiveness. We conducted extensive empirical evaluations with many models on several popular benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our proposed approach in both maintaining model performance and defending against gradient leakage attacks.

Abstract: We address the key challenge of size-induced distribution shifts in graph neural networks (GNNs) and their impact on the generalization of GNNs to larger graphs. Existing literature operates under diverse assumptions about distribution shifts, resulting in varying conclusions about the generalizability of GNNs. In contrast to prior work, we adopt a data-driven approach to identify and characterize the types of size-induced distribution shifts and explore their impact on GNN performance from a spectral standpoint, a perspective that has been largely underexplored. Leveraging the significant variance in graph sizes in real biological datasets, we analyze biological graphs and find that spectral differences, driven by subgraph patterns (e.g., average cycle length), strongly correlate with GNN performance on larger, unseen graphs. Based on these insights, we propose three model-agnostic strategies to enhance GNNs' awareness of critical subgraph patterns, identifying size-intensive attention as the most effective approach. Extensive experiments with six GNN architectures and seven model-agnostic strategies across five datasets show that our size-intensive attention strategy significantly improves graph classification on test graphs 2 to 10 times larger than the training graphs, boosting F1 scores by up to 8% over strong baselines.

Abstract: As a pivotal branch of machine learning, manifold learning uncovers the intrinsic low-dimensional structure within complex nonlinear manifolds in high-dimensional space for visualization, classification, clustering, and gaining key insights. Although existing techniques have achieved remarkable successes, they suffer from extensive distortions of cluster structure, which hinders the understanding of underlying patterns. Scalability issues also limit their applicability for handling large-scale data. We hence propose a sampling-based Scalable manifold learning technique that enables Uniform and Discriminative Embedding, namely SUDE, for large-scale and high-dimensional data. It starts by seeking a set of landmarks to construct the low-dimensional skeleton of the entire data, and then incorporates the non-landmarks into the learned space based on the constrained locally linear embedding (CLLE). We empirically validated the effectiveness of SUDE on synthetic datasets and real-world benchmarks, and applied it to analyze single-cell data and detect anomalies in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. SUDE exhibits distinct advantage in scalability with respect to data size and embedding dimension, and has promising performance in cluster separation, integrity, and global structure preservation. The experiments also demonstrate notable robustness in embedding quality as the sampling rate decreases.

Abstract: Deep learning involves navigating a high-dimensional loss landscape over the neural network parameter space. Over the course of training, complex computational structures form and re-form inside the neural network, leading to shifts in input/output behavior. It is a priority for the science of deep learning to uncover principles governing the development of neural network structure and behavior. Drawing on the framework of singular learning theory, we propose that model development is deeply linked to degeneracy in the local geometry of the loss landscape. We investigate this link by monitoring loss landscape degeneracy throughout training, as quantified by the local learning coefficient, for a transformer language model and an in-context linear regression transformer. We show that training can be divided into distinct periods of change in loss landscape degeneracy, and that these changes in degeneracy coincide with significant changes in the internal computational structure and the input/output behavior of the transformers. This finding provides suggestive evidence that degeneracy and development are linked in transformers, underscoring the potential of a degeneracy-based perspective for understanding modern deep learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient fine-tuning method for large pre-trained models, offering strong in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. Breaking away from traditional practices that need a multitude of fine-tuned models for averaging, our approach employs significantly fewer models to achieve final weights yet yield superior accuracy. Drawing from key insights in the weight space of fine-tuned weights, we uncover a strong link between the performance and proximity to the center of weight space. Based on this, we introduce a method that approximates a center-close weight using only two fine-tuned models, applicable during or after training. Our innovative layer-wise weight averaging technique surpasses state-of-the-art model methods such as Model Soup, utilizing only two fine-tuned models. This strategy can be aptly coined Model Stock, highlighting its reliance on selecting a minimal number of models to draw a more optimized-averaged model. We demonstrate the efficacy of Model Stock with fine-tuned models based upon pre-trained CLIP architectures, achieving remarkable performance on both ID and OOD tasks on the standard benchmarks, all while barely bringing extra computational demands. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/naver-ai/model-stock.

<title>SPLITZ: Certifiable Robustness via Split Lipschitz Randomized Smoothing</title>

Abstract: Certifiable robustness gives the guarantee that small perturbations around an input to a classifier will not change the prediction. There are two approaches to provide certifiable robustness to adversarial examples: a) explicitly training classifiers with small Lipschitz constants, and b) Randomized smoothing, which adds random noise to the input to create a smooth classifier. We propose SPLITZ, a practical and novel approach which leverages the synergistic benefits of both the above ideas into a single framework. Our main idea is to split a classifier into two halves, constrain the Lipschitz constant of the first half, and smooth the second half via randomization. Motivation for SPLITZ comes from the observation that many standard deep networks exhibit heterogeneity in Lipschitz constants across layers. SPLITZ can exploit this heterogeneity while inheriting the scalability of randomized smoothing. We present a principled approach to train SPLITZ and provide theoretical analysis to derive certified robustness guarantees during inference. We present a comprehensive comparison of robustness-accuracy trade-offs and show that SPLITZ consistently improves on existing state-of-the-art approaches in the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For instance, with $\ell_2$ norm perturbation budget of $\epsilon=1$, SPLITZ achieves $43.2\%$ top-1 test accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset compared to state-of-art top-1 test accuracy $39.8\%$.

Abstract: The optimization algorithms are crucial in training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), as unsuitable methods may lead to poor solutions. Compared to the common gradient descent (GD) algorithm, implicit gradient descent (IGD) outperforms it in handling certain multi-scale problems. In this paper, we provide convergence analysis for the IGD in training over-parameterized two-layer PINNs. We first derive the training dynamics of IGD in training two-layer PINNs. Then, over-parameterization allows us to prove that the randomly initialized IGD converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate. Moreover, due to the distinct training dynamics of IGD compared to GD, the learning rate can be selected independently of the sample size and the least eigenvalue of the Gram matrix. Additionally, the novel approach used in our convergence analysis imposes a milder requirement on the network width. Finally, empirical results validate our theoretical findings.

<title>TensorSocket: Shared Data Loading for Deep Learning Training</title>

Abstract: Training deep learning models is a repetitive and resource-intensive process. Data scientists often train several models before landing on a set of parameters (e.g., hyper-parameter tuning) and model architecture (e.g., neural architecture search), among other things that yield the highest accuracy. The computational efficiency of these training tasks depends highly on how well the training data is supplied to the training process. The repetitive nature of these tasks results in the same data processing pipelines running over and over, exacerbating the need for and costs of computational resources. In this paper, we present TensorSocket to reduce the computational needs of deep learning training by enabling simultaneous training processes to share the same data loader. TensorSocket mitigates CPU-side bottlenecks in cases where the collocated training workloads have high throughput on GPU, but are held back by lower data-loading throughput on CPU. TensorSocket achieves this by reducing redundant computations and data duplication across collocated training processes and leveraging modern GPU-GPU interconnects. While doing so, TensorSocket is able to train and balance differently-sized models and serve multiple batch sizes simultaneously and is hardware- and pipeline-agnostic in nature. Our evaluation shows that TensorSocket enables scenarios that are infeasible without data sharing, increases training throughput by up to 100%, and when utilizing cloud instances, achieves cost savings of 50% by reducing the hardware resource needs on the CPU side. Furthermore, TensorSocket outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions for shared data loading such as CoorDL and Joader; it is easier to deploy and maintain and either achieves higher or matches their throughput while requiring fewer CPU resources.

Abstract: Energy-based policies offer a flexible framework for modeling complex, multimodal behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL). In maximum entropy RL, the optimal policy is a Boltzmann distribution derived from the soft Q-function, but direct sampling from this distribution in continuous action spaces is computationally intractable. As a result, existing methods typically use simpler parametric distributions, like Gaussians, for policy representation -- limiting their ability to capture the full complexity of multimodal action distributions. In this paper, we introduce a diffusion-based approach for sampling from energy-based policies, where the negative Q-function defines the energy function. Based on this approach, we propose an actor-critic method called Diffusion Q-Sampling (DQS) that enables more expressive policy representations, allowing stable learning in diverse environments. We show that our approach enhances sample efficiency in continuous control tasks and captures multimodal behaviors, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

<title>Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data</title>

Abstract: Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.

Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.

<title>Un-mixing Test-time Adaptation under Heterogeneous Data Streams</title>

Abstract: Deploying deep models in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to significant performance drops under distribution shifts between training and deployment environments. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has recently emerged as a promising solution, enabling on-the-fly model adaptation without access to source data. However, its effectiveness degrades significantly in the presence of complex, mixed distribution shifts - common in practical settings - where multiple latent domains coexist. Adapting under such intrinsic heterogeneity, especially in unlabeled and online conditions, remains an open and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we study TTA under mixed distribution shifts and move beyond conventional homogeneous adaptation paradigms. By revisiting TTA from a frequency-domain perspective, we observe that distribution heterogeneity often manifests in Fourier space - for instance, high-frequency components tend to carry domain-specific variations. This motivates us to perform domain-aware separation using high-frequency texture cues, making diverse shift patterns more tractable. To this end, we propose FreDA, a novel Frequency-based Decentralized Adaptation framework that decomposes globally heterogeneous data into locally homogeneous components in the frequency domain. It further employs decentralized learning and augmentation strategies to robustly adapt under complex, evolving shifts. Extensive experiments across various environments (corrupted, natural, and medical) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over the state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting aims to predict future traffic flows based on the historical traffic conditions and the road network. It is an important problem in intelligent transportation systems, with a plethora of methods been proposed. Existing efforts mainly focus on capturing and utilizing spatio-temporal dependencies to predict future traffic flows. Though promising, they fall short in adapting to test-time environmental changes of traffic conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to introduce large language models (LLMs) to help traffic flow forecasting and design a novel method named Large Language Model Enhanced Traffic Flow Predictor (LEAF). LEAF adopts two branches, capturing different spatio-temporal relations using graph and hypergraph structures respectively. The two branches are first pre-trained individually, and during test-time, they yield different predictions. Based on these predictions, a large language model is used to select the most likely result. Then, a ranking loss is applied as the learning objective to enhance the prediction ability of the two branches. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LEAF.

Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving 99.1\% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.

Abstract: The label ranking problem is a supervised learning scenario in which the learner predicts a total order of the class labels for a given input instance. Recently, research has increasingly focused on the partial label ranking problem, a generalization of the label ranking problem that allows ties in the predicted orders. So far, most existing learning approaches for the partial label ranking problem rely on approximation algorithms for rank aggregation in the final prediction step. This paper explores several alternative aggregation methods for this critical step, including scoring-based and non-parametric probabilistic-based rank aggregation approaches. To enhance their suitability for the more general partial label ranking problem, the investigated methods are extended to increase the likelihood of producing ties. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that scoring-based variants consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art method in handling incomplete information. In contrast, non-parametric probabilistic-based variants fail to achieve competitive performance.

<title>Unlocking Multi-Modal Potentials for Link Prediction on Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs</title>

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs) are a novel graph paradigm that captures evolving temporal events (edges) alongside rich textual attributes. Existing studies can be broadly categorized into TGNN-driven and LLM-driven approaches, both of which encode textual attributes and temporal structures for DyTAG representation. We observe that DyTAGs inherently comprise three distinct modalities: temporal, textual, and structural, often exhibiting completely disjoint distributions. However, the first two modalities are largely overlooked by existing studies, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose MoMent, a multi-modal model that explicitly models, integrates, and aligns each modality to learn node representations for link prediction. Given the disjoint nature of the original modality distributions, we first construct modality-specific features and encode them using individual encoders to capture correlations across temporal patterns, semantic context, and local structures. Each encoder generates modality-specific tokens, which are then fused into comprehensive node representations with a theoretical guarantee. To avoid disjoint subspaces of these heterogeneous modalities, we propose a dual-domain alignment loss that first aligns their distributions globally and then fine-tunes coherence at the instance level. This enhances coherent representations from temporal, textual, and structural views. Extensive experiments across seven datasets show that MoMent achieves up to 17.28% accuracy improvement and up to 31x speed-up against eight baselines.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a billion-dollar problem in machine learning, which significantly impacts the training efficiency and model performance. However, achieving efficient and robust HPO in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is consistently challenging due to its high non-stationarity and computational cost. To tackle this problem, existing approaches attempt to adapt common HPO techniques (e.g., population-based training or Bayesian optimization) to the RL scenario. However, they remain sample-inefficient and computationally expensive, which cannot facilitate a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ULTHO, an ultra-lightweight yet powerful framework for fast HPO in deep RL within single runs. Specifically, we formulate the HPO process as a multi-armed bandit with clustered arms (MABC) and link it directly to long-term return optimization. ULTHO also provides a quantified and statistical perspective to filter the HPs efficiently. We test ULTHO on benchmarks including ALE, Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the ULTHO can achieve superior performance with a simple architecture, contributing to the development of advanced and automated RL systems.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) data features diverse sensing platforms with varying spectral bands, spatial resolutions, and sensing modalities. While most prior work has constrained inputs to fixed sensors, a new class of any-sensor foundation models able to process arbitrary sensors has recently emerged. Contributing to this line of work, we propose Panopticon, an any-sensor foundation model built on the DINOv2 framework. We extend DINOv2 by (1) treating images of the same geolocation across sensors as natural augmentations, (2) subsampling channels to diversify spectral input, and (3) adding a cross attention over channels as a flexible patch embedding mechanism. By encoding the wavelength and modes of optical and synthetic aperture radar sensors, respectively, Panopticon can effectively process any combination of arbitrary channels. In extensive evaluations, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on GEO-Bench, especially on the widely-used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensors, while out-competing other any-sensor models, as well as domain adapted fixed-sensor models on unique sensor configurations. Panopticon enables immediate generalization to both existing and future satellite platforms, advancing sensor-agnostic EO.

Abstract: Preserving topological features in learned latent spaces is a fundamental challenge in representation learning, particularly for topology-sensitive data. This paper introduces directional sign loss (DSL), an efficient, differentiable loss function that approximates the number of mismatches in the signs of finite differences between corresponding elements of two arrays. By penalizing discrepancies in critical points between input and reconstructed data, DSL encourages autoencoders and other learnable compressors to retain the topological features of the original data. We present the formulation and complexity analysis of DSL, comparing it to other non-differentiable topological measures. Experiments on multidimensional array data show that combining DSL with traditional loss functions preserves topological features more effectively than traditional losses alone. DSL serves as a differentiable, efficient proxy for common topology-based metrics, enabling topological feature preservation on previously impractical problem sizes and in a wider range of gradient-based optimization frameworks.

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting in zero-shot settings is critical for investment decisions, especially during abrupt market regime shifts or in emerging markets with limited historical data. While Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) approaches show promise, existing meta-task construction strategies often yield suboptimal performance for highly turbulent financial series. To address this, we propose a novel task-construction method that leverages learned embeddings for both meta task and also downstream predictions, enabling effective zero-shot meta-learning. Specifically, we use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to softly cluster embeddings, constructing two complementary meta-task types: intra-cluster tasks and inter-cluster tasks. By assigning embeddings to multiple latent regimes probabilistically, GMMs enable richer, more diverse meta-learning. This dual approach ensures the model can quickly adapt to local patterns while simultaneously capturing invariant cross-series features. Furthermore, we enhance inter-cluster generalization through hard task mining, which identifies robust patterns across divergent market regimes. Our method was validated using real-world financial data from high-volatility periods and multiple international markets (including emerging markets). The results demonstrate significant out-performance over existing approaches and stronger generalization in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Current subgroup identification methods typically follow a two-step approach: first estimate conditional average treatment effects and then apply thresholding or rule-based procedures to define subgroups. While intuitive, this decoupled approach fails to incorporate key constraints essential for real-world clinical decision-making, such as subgroup size and propensity overlap. These constraints operate on fundamentally different axes than CATE estimation and are not naturally accommodated within existing frameworks, thereby limiting the practical applicability of these methods. We propose a unified optimization framework that directly solves the primal constrained optimization problem to identify optimal subgroups. Our key innovation is a reformulation of the constrained primal problem as an unconstrained differentiable min-max objective, solved via a gradient descent-ascent algorithm. We theoretically establish that our solution converges to a feasible and locally optimal solution. Unlike threshold-based CATE methods that apply constraints as post-hoc filters, our approach enforces them directly during optimization. The framework is model-agnostic, compatible with a wide range of CATE estimators, and extensible to additional constraints like cost limits or fairness criteria. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying high-benefit subgroups while maintaining better satisfaction of constraints.

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer learning-enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on concomitant aerodynamic and structural integrity criteria. To showcase the method, we aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that DRL agents are able to perform purely aerodynamic and hybrid aerodynamic/structural shape optimisation, that the DRL approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and aerodynamic improvement, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial computational resources.

Abstract: Recent Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combine spectral-spatial architectures for enhanced representation learning. However, limited attention has been paid to certified robustness, particularly regarding training strategies and underlying rationale. In this paper, we explicitly specialize each branch: the spectral network is trained to withstand l0 edge flips and capture homophilic structures, while the spatial part is designed to resist linf feature perturbations and heterophilic patterns. A context-aware gating network adaptively fuses the two representations, dynamically routing each node's prediction to the more reliable branch. This specialized adversarial training scheme uses branch-specific inner maximization (structure vs feature attacks) and a unified alignment objective. We provide theoretical guarantees: (i) expressivity of the gating mechanism beyond 1-WL, (ii) spectral-spatial frequency bias, and (iii) certified robustness with trade-off. Empirically, SpecSphere attains state-of-the-art node classification accuracy and offers tighter certified robustness on real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Transformer-based tabular foundation models have recently demonstrated promising in-context learning (ICL) performance on structured data, emerging as competitive alternatives to gradient-boosted trees. However, the fairness implications of this new paradigm remain largely unexplored. We present the first investigation of fairness in tabular ICL, evaluating three recently proposed foundation models -- TabPFNv2, TabICL, and TabDPT -- on multiple benchmark datasets. To mitigate biases, we explore three pre-processing fairness-enhancing methods: correlation removal (decorrelating input features from the sensitive attribute), group-balanced sample selection (ensuring equal representation of protected groups in context examples), and uncertainty-based sample selection (prioritizing context examples with high sensitive-attribute prediction uncertainty). Our experiments show that the uncertainty-based strategy consistently improves group fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity) with minimal impact on predictive accuracy. We release our code to facilitate reproducibility (https://github.com/patrikken/Fair-TabICL)

Abstract: The forecasting of irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is a critical task in domains like healthcare and climate science. However, this task faces two significant hurdles: 1) the inherent non-uniformity and missing data in IMTS complicate the modeling of temporal dynamics, and 2) existing methods often rely on computationally expensive architectures. To address these dual challenges, we introduce APN, a general and efficient forecasting framework. At the core of APN is a novel Time-Aware Patch Aggregation (TAPA) module that introduces an aggregation-based paradigm for adaptive patching, moving beyond the limitations of fixed-span segmentation and interpolation-based methods. TAPA first learns dynamic temporal boundaries to define data-driven segments. Crucially, instead of resampling or interpolating, it directly computes patch representations via a time-aware weighted aggregation of all raw observations, where weights are determined by each observation's temporal relevance to the segment. This approach provides two key advantages: it preserves data fidelity by avoiding the introduction of artificial data points and ensures complete information coverage by design.The resulting regularized and information-rich patch representations enable the use of a lightweight query module for historical context aggregation and a simple MLP for final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that APN establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of order fulfillment time is critical for e-commerce logistics, yet traditional rule-based approaches often fail to capture the inherent uncertainties in delivery operations. This paper introduces a novel framework for distributional forecasting of order fulfillment time, leveraging Conformal Predictive Systems and Cross Venn-Abers Predictors -- model-agnostic techniques that provide rigorous coverage or validity guarantees. The proposed machine learning methods integrate granular spatiotemporal features, capturing fulfillment location and carrier performance dynamics to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, a cost-sensitive decision rule is developed to convert probabilistic forecasts into reliable point predictions. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale industrial dataset demonstrates that the proposed methods generate competitive distributional forecasts, while machine learning-based point predictions significantly outperform the existing rule-based system -- achieving up to 14% higher prediction accuracy and up to 75% improvement in identifying late deliveries.

<title>How to Evaluate Participant Contributions in Decentralized Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing local data. In particular, decentralized FL (DFL), where clients exchange models without a central server, has gained attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks. Evaluating participant contributions is crucial in DFL to incentivize active participation and enhance transparency. However, existing contribution evaluation methods for FL assume centralized settings and cannot be applied directly to DFL due to two challenges: the inaccessibility of each client to non-neighboring clients' models, and the necessity to trace how contributions propagate in conjunction with peer-to-peer model exchanges over time. To address these challenges, we propose TRIP-Shapley, a novel contribution evaluation method for DFL. TRIP-Shapley formulates the clients' overall contributions by tracing the propagation of the round-wise local contributions. In this way, TRIP-Shapley accurately reflects the delayed and gradual influence propagation, as well as allowing a lightweight coordinator node to estimate the overall contributions without collecting models, but based solely on locally observable contributions reported by each client. Experiments demonstrate that TRIP-Shapley is sufficiently close to the ground-truth Shapley value, is scalable to large-scale scenarios, and remains robust in the presence of dishonest clients.

<title>EVINET: Towards Open-World Graph Learning via Evidential Reasoning Network</title>

Abstract: Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

Abstract: As privacy protection gains increasing importance, more models are being trained on edge devices and subsequently merged into the central server through Federated Learning (FL). However, current research overlooks the impact of network topology, physical distance, and data heterogeneity on edge devices, leading to issues such as increased latency and degraded model performance. To address these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge devices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS). FedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data encryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other clients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and encrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's local private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the model. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning training and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it suitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid convergence. Experiments results show the efficacy of FedEDS in promoting model performance.

Abstract: When building a world model, a common assumption is that the environment has a single, unchanging underlying causal rule, like applying Newton's laws to every situation. In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is often the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow observational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world model, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very observed causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \textbf{Meta-Causal Graph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently encodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across different latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of multiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent state space. Building on this representation, we introduce a \textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta states that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal relationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3) iteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven exploration and agent experiences. Experiments on both synthetic tasks and a challenging robot arm manipulation task demonstrate that our method robustly captures shifts in causal dynamics and generalizes effectively to previously unseen contexts.

<title>OmniDraft: A Cross-vocabulary, Online Adaptive Drafter for On-device Speculative Decoding</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably, OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding; and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching. The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants, such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

Abstract: Neural Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based models are powerful and interpretable approaches to neuro-symbolic learning and have shown promising results in classification and reinforcement learning settings without prior knowledge of the tasks. However, their performance is degraded by the thresholding of the post-training symbolic translation process. We show here that part of the performance degradation during translation is due to its failure to disentangle the learned knowledge represented in the form of the networks' weights. We address this issue by proposing a new disentanglement method; by splitting nodes that encode nested rules into smaller independent nodes, we are able to better preserve the models' performance. Through experiments on binary, multiclass, and multilabel classification tasks (including those requiring predicate invention), we demonstrate that our disentanglement method provides compact and interpretable logical representations for the neural DNF-based models, with performance closer to that of their pre-translation counterparts. Our code is available at https://github.com/kittykg/disentangling-ndnf-classification.

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning. The code (https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Time-RA) and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Time-RA/RATs40K) have been fully open-sourced to support and accelerate future research in this area.

Abstract: In 1954, Alston S. Householder published Principles of Numerical Analysis, one of the first modern treatments on matrix decomposition that favored a (block) LU decomposition-the factorization of a matrix into the product of lower and upper triangular matrices. And now, matrix decomposition has become a core technology in machine learning, largely due to the development of the backpropagation algorithm in fitting a neural network. The sole aim of this survey is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and mathematical tools in numerical linear algebra and matrix analysis in order to seamlessly introduce matrix decomposition techniques and their applications in subsequent sections. However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results concerning matrix decomposition, given the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis of the Euclidean space, Hermitian space, Hilbert space, and things in the complex domain. We refer the reader to literature in the field of linear algebra for a more detailed introduction to the related fields.

Abstract: Quantum generative models use the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to learn and reproduce complex probability distributions. In this paper, we present an implementation of a 3-qubit quantum circuit Born machine trained to model a 3-bit Gaussian distribution using a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss and parameter-shift gradient optimization. The variational quantum circuit consists of layers of parameterized rotations and entangling gates, and is optimized such that the Born rule output distribution closely matches the target distribution. We detail the mathematical formulation of the model distribution, the KL divergence cost function, and the parameter-shift rule for gradient evaluation. Training results on a statevector simulator show that the KL divergence is minimized to near zero, and the final generated distribution aligns quantitatively with the target probabilities. We analyze the convergence behavior and discuss the implications for scalability and quantum advantage. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of small-scale quantum generative learning and provide insight into the training dynamics of quantum circuit models.

Abstract: We consider the paradigm of unsupervised anomaly detection, which involves the identification of anomalies within a dataset in the absence of labeled examples. Though distance-based methods are top-performing for unsupervised anomaly detection, they suffer heavily from the sensitivity to the choice of the number of the nearest neighbors. In this paper, we propose a new distance-based algorithm called bagged regularized $k$-distances for anomaly detection (BRDAD), converting the unsupervised anomaly detection problem into a convex optimization problem. Our BRDAD algorithm selects the weights by minimizing the surrogate risk, i.e., the finite sample bound of the empirical risk of the bagged weighted $k$-distances for density estimation (BWDDE). This approach enables us to successfully address the sensitivity challenge of the hyperparameter choice in distance-based algorithms. Moreover, when dealing with large-scale datasets, the efficiency issues can be addressed by the incorporated bagging technique in our BRDAD algorithm. On the theoretical side, we establish fast convergence rates of the AUC regret of our algorithm and demonstrate that the bagging technique significantly reduces the computational complexity. On the practical side, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the insensitivity of the parameter selection of our algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art distance-based methods. Furthermore, our method achieves superior performance on real-world datasets with the introduced bagging technique compared to other approaches.

Abstract: Random Forests are widely claimed to capture interactions well. However, some simple examples suggest that they perform poorly in the presence of certain pure interactions that the conventional CART criterion struggles to capture during tree construction. Motivated from this, it is argued that simple alternative partitioning schemes used in the tree growing procedure can enhance identification of these interactions. In a simulation study these variants are compared to conventional Random Forests and Extremely Randomized Trees. The results validate that the modifications considered enhance the model's fitting ability in scenarios where pure interactions play a crucial role. Finally, the methods are applied to real datasets.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful framework for training AI agents to coordinate with human partners. However, DRL faces two critical challenges in human-AI coordination (HAIC): sparse rewards and unpredictable human behaviors. These challenges significantly limit DRL to identify effective coordination policies, due to its impaired capability of optimizing exploration and exploitation. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative behavior- and context-aware reward (BCR) for DRL, which optimizes exploration and exploitation by leveraging human behaviors and contextual information in HAIC. Our BCR consists of two components: (i) A novel dual intrinsic rewarding scheme to enhance exploration. This scheme composes an AI self-motivated intrinsic reward and a human-motivated intrinsic reward, which are designed to increase the capture of sparse rewards by a logarithmic-based strategy; and (ii) A new context-aware weighting mechanism for the designed rewards to improve exploitation. This mechanism helps the AI agent prioritize actions that better coordinate with the human partner by utilizing contextual information that can reflect the evolution of learning. Extensive simulations in the Overcooked environment demonstrate that our approach can increase the cumulative sparse rewards by approximately 20%, and improve the sample efficiency by around 38% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: For statistical modeling wherein the data regime is unfavorable in terms of dimensionality relative to the sample size, finding hidden sparsity in the ground truth can be critical in formulating an accurate statistical model. The so-called "l0 norm" which counts the number of non-zero components in a vector, is a strong reliable mechanism of enforcing sparsity when incorporated into an optimization problem for minimizing the fit of a given model to a set of observations. However, in big data settings wherein noisy estimates of the gradient must be evaluated out of computational necessity, the literature is scant on methods that reliably converge. In this paper we present an approach towards solving expectation objective optimization problems with cardinality constraints. We prove convergence of the underlying stochastic process, and demonstrate the performance on two Machine Learning problems.

Abstract: This paper proposes three types of Bayesian CART (or BCART) models for aggregate claim amount, namely, frequency-severity models, sequential models and joint models. We propose a general framework for the BCART models applicable to data with multivariate responses, which is particularly useful for the joint BCART models with a bivariate response: the number of claims and aggregate claim amount. To facilitate frequency-severity modeling, we investigate BCART models for the right-skewed and heavy-tailed claim severity data by using various distributions. We discover that the Weibull distribution is superior to gamma and lognormal distributions, due to its ability to capture different tail characteristics in tree models. Additionally, we find that sequential BCART models and joint BCART models, which incorporate dependence between the number of claims and average severity, are beneficial and thus preferable to the frequency-severity BCART models in which independence is assumed. The effectiveness of these models' performance is illustrated by carefully designed simulations and real insurance data.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) enables multiple data owners to contribute their data privately to a set of servers that run a secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to train a joint ML model. In these protocols, the input data remains private throughout the training process, and only the resulting model is made available. While this approach benefits privacy, it also exacerbates the risks of data poisoning, where compromised data owners induce undesirable model behavior by contributing malicious datasets. Existing MPC mechanisms can mitigate certain poisoning attacks, but these measures are not exhaustive. To complement existing poisoning defenses, we introduce UTrace: a framework for User-level Traceback of poisoning attacks in PPML. Utrace computes user responsibility scores using gradient similarity metrics aggregated across the most relevant samples in an owner's dataset. UTrace is effective at low poisoning rates and is resilient to poisoning attacks distributed across multiple data owners, unlike existing unlearning-based methods. We introduce methods for checkpointing gradients with low storage overhead, enabling traceback in the absence of data owners at deployment time. We also design several optimizations that reduce traceback time and communication in MPC. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of UTrace across four datasets from three data modalities (vision, text, and malware) and show its effectiveness against 10 poisoning attacks.

Abstract: AI policy sets boundaries on acceptable behavior for AI models, but this is challenging in the context of large language models (LLMs): how do you ensure coverage over a vast behavior space? We introduce policy maps, an approach to AI policy design inspired by the practice of physical mapmaking. Instead of aiming for full coverage, policy maps aid effective navigation through intentional design choices about which aspects to capture and which to abstract away. With Policy Projector, an interactive tool for designing LLM policy maps, an AI practitioner can survey the landscape of model input-output pairs, define custom regions (e.g., "violence"), and navigate these regions with if-then policy rules that can act on LLM outputs (e.g., if output contains "violence" and "graphic details," then rewrite without "graphic details"). Policy Projector supports interactive policy authoring using LLM classification and steering and a map visualization reflecting the AI practitioner's work. In an evaluation with 12 AI safety experts, our system helps policy designers craft policies around problematic model behaviors such as incorrect gender assumptions and handling of immediate physical safety threats.

Abstract: Operating in unstructured environments like households requires robotic policies that are robust to out-of-distribution conditions. Although much work has been done in evaluating robustness for visuomotor policies, the robustness evaluation of a multisensory approach that includes force-torque sensing remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a novel, factor-based evaluation framework with the goal of assessing the robustness of multisensory policies in a peg-in-hole assembly task. To this end, we develop a multisensory policy framework utilizing the Perceiver IO architecture to learn the task. We investigate which factors pose the greatest generalization challenges in object assembly and explore a simple multisensory data augmentation technique to enhance out-of-distribution performance. We provide a simulation environment enabling controlled evaluation of these factors. Our results reveal that multisensory variations such as Grasp Pose present the most significant challenges for robustness, and naive unisensory data augmentation applied independently to each sensory modality proves insufficient to overcome them. Additionally, we find force-torque sensing to be the most informative modality for our contact-rich assembly task, with vision being the least informative. Finally, we briefly discuss supporting real-world experimental results. For additional experiments and qualitative results, we refer to the project webpage https://rpm-lab-umn.github.io/auginsert/ .

Abstract: Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.

Abstract: Domain randomization through synthesis is a powerful strategy to train networks that are unbiased with respect to the domain of the input images. Randomization allows networks to see a virtually infinite range of intensities and artifacts during training, thereby minimizing overfitting to appearance and maximizing generalization to unseen data. Although powerful, this approach relies on the accurate tuning of a large set of hyperparameters that govern the probabilistic distribution of the synthesized images. Instead of manually tuning these parameters, we introduce Learn2Synth, a novel procedure in which synthesis parameters are learned using a small set of real labeled data. Unlike methods that impose constraints to align synthetic data with real data (e.g., contrastive or adversarial techniques), which risk misaligning the image and its label map, we tune an augmentation engine such that a segmentation network trained on synthetic data has optimal accuracy when applied to real data. This approach allows the training procedure to benefit from real labeled examples, without ever using these real examples to train the segmentation network, which avoids biasing the network towards the properties of the training set. Specifically, we develop parametric and nonparametric strategies to enhance synthetic images in a way that improves the performance of the segmentation network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this learning strategy on synthetic and real-world brain scans. Code is available at: https://github.com/HuXiaoling/Learn2Synth.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) combined with AI offers new opportunities for proactive diabetes management through real-time glucose forecasting. However, most existing models are task-specific and lack generalization across patient populations. Inspired by the autoregressive paradigm of large language models, we introduce CGM-LSM, a Transformer decoder-based Large Sensor Model (LSM) pretrained on 1.6 million CGM records from patients with different diabetes types, ages, and genders. We model patients as sequences of glucose time steps to learn latent knowledge embedded in CGM data and apply it to the prediction of glucose readings for a 2-hour horizon. Compared with prior methods, CGM-LSM significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness: a 48.51% reduction in root mean square error in one-hour horizon forecasting and consistent zero-shot prediction performance across held-out patient groups. We analyze model performance variations across patient subgroups and prediction scenarios and outline key opportunities and challenges for advancing CGM foundation models.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data providers jointly train a model without disclosing their training data. Despite its inherent privacy benefits, a malicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol without being detected, potentially compromising the trained model. While current solutions have explored the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to combat such attacks, they usually assume side-channel attacks against the TEEs are out of scope. However, such side-channel attacks can undermine the security properties of TEE-based FL frameworks, not by extracting the FL data, but by leaking keys that allow the adversary to impersonate as the TEE whilst deviating arbitrarily from the correct training protocol.
  We describe ExclaveFL, an FL platform that provides end-to-end integrity and transparency, even in the presence of side-channel attacks on TEEs. We propose a new paradigm in which existing TEEs are used as exclaves -- integrity-protected execution environments that do not contain any secrets, making them immune to side-channel attacks. Whereas previous approaches attest the TEE itself and bind this attestation to a key held by the TEE, ExclaveFL attests individual data transformations at runtime. These runtime attestations form an attested dataflow graph, which can be checked to ensure the FL training job satisfies claims, such as deviations from the correct computation. We implement ExclaveFL by extending the popular NVFlare FL framework to use exclaves, and show experimentally that ExclaveFL introduces less than 10% overhead compared to the same FL framework without TEEs, whilst providing stronger security guarantees.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs learn word representations that exhibit the undesirable yet poorly understood feature of anisotropy. In this paper, we argue that the second moment in Adam is a cause of anisotropic embeddings, and suggest a modified optimizer called Coupled Adam to mitigate the problem. Our experiments demonstrate that Coupled Adam significantly improves the quality of embeddings, while also leading to better upstream and downstream performance on large enough datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as highly capable systems and are increasingly being integrated into various uses. However, the rapid pace of their deployment has outpaced a comprehensive understanding of their internal mechanisms and a delineation of their capabilities and limitations. A desired attribute of an intelligent system is its ability to recognize the scope of its own knowledge. To investigate whether LLMs embody this characteristic, we develop a benchmark designed to challenge these models to enumerate all information they possess on specific topics. This benchmark evaluates whether the models recall excessive, insufficient, or the precise amount of information, thereby indicating their awareness of their own knowledge. Our findings reveal that all tested LLMs, given sufficient scale, demonstrate an understanding of how much they know about specific topics. While different architectures exhibit varying rates of this capability's emergence, the results suggest that awareness of knowledge may be a generalizable attribute of LLMs. Further research is needed to confirm this potential and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Optical computing systems provide an alternate hardware model which appears to be aligned with the demands of neural network workloads. However, the challenge of implementing energy efficient nonlinearities in optics -- a key requirement for realizing neural networks -- is a conspicuous missing link. In this work we introduce a novel method to achieve nonlinear computation in fully linear media. Our method can operate at low power and requires only the ability to drive the optical system at a data-dependent spatial position. Leveraging this positional encoding, we formulate a fully automated, topology-optimization-based hardware design framework for extremely specialized optical neural networks, drawing on modern advancements in optimization and machine learning. We evaluate our optical designs on machine learning classification tasks: demonstrating significant improvements over linear methods, and competitive performance when compared to standard artificial neural networks.

<title>Are Sparse Autoencoders Useful for Java Function Bug Detection?</title>

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making in batched nonparametric contextual bandits, where actions are selected over a finite horizon divided into a small number of batches. Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement. Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine, supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection, surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges, we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns. NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.

Summary:
This paper introduces a framework for detecting cheating with the assistance of large language models (LLMs) in Korean writing tasks. The study involved 69 participants completing tasks under different conditions, ranging from genuine writing to paraphrasing and transcribing responses generated by a language model. The tasks were designed to cover various cognitive processes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. The analysis focused on extracting temporal and rhythmic features and evaluating different classifiers in Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings. Results showed that temporal features were effective in scenarios where cognition was taken into account, while rhythmic features performed better across different cognitive demands. Detecting genuine and transcribed responses was more straightforward compared to detecting paraphrased ones, and the models consistently outperformed human evaluators.

Abstract: This paper presents a keystroke-based framework for detecting LLM-assisted cheating in Korean, addressing key gaps in prior research regarding language coverage, cognitive context, and the granularity of LLM involvement. Our proposed dataset includes 69 participants who completed writing tasks under three conditions: Bona fide writing, paraphrasing ChatGPT responses, and transcribing ChatGPT responses. Each task spans six cognitive processes defined in Bloom's Taxonomy (remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create). We extract interpretable temporal and rhythmic features and evaluate multiple classifiers under both Cognition-Aware and Cognition-Unaware settings. Temporal features perform well under Cognition-Aware evaluation scenarios, while rhythmic features generalize better under cross-cognition scenarios. Moreover, detecting bona fide and transcribed responses was easier than paraphrased ones for both the proposed models and human evaluators, with the models significantly outperforming the humans. Our findings affirm that keystroke dynamics facilitate reliable detection of LLM-assisted writing across varying cognitive demands and writing strategies, including paraphrasing and transcribing LLM-generated responses.

Abstract: The field of scientific machine learning, which originally utilized multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is increasingly adopting Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for data encoding. This shift is driven by the limitations of MLPs, including poor interpretability, fixed activation functions, and difficulty capturing localized or high-frequency features. KANs address these issues with enhanced interpretability and flexibility, enabling more efficient modeling of complex nonlinear interactions and effectively overcoming the constraints associated with conventional MLP architectures. This review categorizes recent progress in KAN-based models across three distinct perspectives: (i) data-driven learning, (ii) physics-informed modeling, and (iii) deep operator learning. Each perspective is examined through the lens of architectural design, training strategies, application efficacy, and comparative evaluation against MLP-based counterparts. By benchmarking KANs against MLPs, we highlight consistent improvements in accuracy, convergence, and spectral representation, clarifying KANs' advantages in capturing complex dynamics while learning more effectively. Finally, this review identifies critical challenges and open research questions in KAN development, particularly regarding computational efficiency, theoretical guarantees, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithm complexity. We also outline future research directions aimed at improving the robustness, scalability, and physical consistency of KAN-based frameworks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Climate extremes present escalating risks to agriculture intensifying the need for reliable multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS). The situation is evolving due to climate change and hence such systems should have the intelligent to continue to learn from recent climate behaviours. However, traditional single-hazard forecasting methods fall short in capturing complex interactions among concurrent climatic events. To address this deficiency, in this paper, we combine sequential deep learning models and advanced Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to introduce a multi-hazard forecasting framework for agriculture. In our experiments, we utilize meteorological data from four prominent agricultural regions in the United States (between 2010 and 2023) to validate the predictive accuracy of our framework on multiple severe event types, which are extreme cold, floods, frost, hail, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall, with tailored models for each area. The framework uniquely integrates attention mechanisms with TimeSHAP (a recurrent XAI explainer for time series) to provide comprehensive temporal explanations revealing not only which climatic features are influential but precisely when their impacts occur. Our results demonstrate strong predictive accuracy, particularly with the BiLSTM architecture, and highlight the system's capacity to inform nuanced, proactive risk management strategies. This research significantly advances the explainability and applicability of multi-hazard EWS, fostering interdisciplinary trust and effective decision-making process for climate risk management in the agricultural industry.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) cause over 17 million deaths annually worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for privacy-preserving predictive systems. We introduce FedCVD++, an enhanced federated learning (FL) framework that integrates both parametric models (logistic regression, SVM, neural networks) and non-parametric models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for coronary heart disease risk prediction. To address key FL challenges, we propose: (1) tree-subset sampling that reduces Random Forest communication overhead by 70%, (2) XGBoost-based feature extraction enabling lightweight federated ensembles, and (3) federated SMOTE synchronization for resolving cross-institutional class imbalance.
  Evaluated on the Framingham dataset (4,238 records), FedCVD++ achieves state-of-the-art results: federated XGBoost (F1 = 0.80) surpasses its centralized counterpart (F1 = 0.78), and federated Random Forest (F1 = 0.81) matches non-federated performance. Additionally, our communication-efficient strategies reduce bandwidth consumption by 3.2X while preserving 95% accuracy.
  Compared to existing FL frameworks, FedCVD++ delivers up to 15% higher F1-scores and superior scalability for multi-institutional deployment. This work represents the first practical integration of non-parametric models into federated healthcare systems, providing a privacy-preserving solution validated under real-world clinical constraints.

Summary: 
The study introduces a new deep learning framework, GSM-UTCI, to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at hyperlocal resolution by integrating surface morphology, land cover data, and meteorological conditions. The model shows high accuracy and significantly reduces computation time, making it suitable for city-wide planning. Application of the framework in Philadelphia demonstrates the effectiveness of landscape transformation scenarios in reducing heat stress, with tree canopy conversion showing the most significant cooling effects.

Abstract: As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization, cities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While traditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed assessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit scalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The model fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and hourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) architecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric context. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical accuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\deg}C, while reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire city. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate systematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare earth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially heterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree conversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\deg}C average change in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further reveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover proportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable, fine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling scenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban environments.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Psychological tests, AI performance, Validation, AI-specific evaluation

Summary: 
The paper argues against interpreting the results of Large Language Models (LLMs) on standardized human cognitive and psychological tests as evidence of human-like characteristics, labeling it an ontological error. Human tests are designed for a specific population and applying them to AI without validation risks misinterpretation. There are concerns about the validity, data contamination, cultural bias, and sensitivity of AI benchmark performance as measurements of human-like traits like intelligence. The paper advocates for the development of principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems, instead of relying on human tests. These frameworks could be based on existing psychometrics tests or newly created to suit the unique context of AI. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a range of standardized tests originally designed to assess human cognitive and psychological traits, such as intelligence and personality. While these results are often interpreted as strong evidence of human-like characteristics in LLMs, this paper argues that such interpretations constitute an ontological error. Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement instruments, calibrated to a specific human population. Applying these tests to non-human subjects without empirical validation, risks mischaracterizing what is being measured. Furthermore, a growing trend frames AI performance on benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known issues with validity, data contamination, cultural bias and sensitivity to superficial prompt changes. We argue that interpreting benchmark performance as measurements of human-like traits, lacks sufficient theoretical and empirical justification. This leads to our position: Stop Evaluating AI with Human Tests, Develop Principled, AI-specific Tests instead. We call for the development of principled, AI-specific evaluation frameworks tailored to AI systems. Such frameworks might build on existing frameworks for constructing and validating psychometrics tests, or could be created entirely from scratch to fit the unique context of AI.

<div> latent spaces, multimodal, inverse mappings, optimization, AI<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper explores the potential of multimodal latent spaces in task-specific AI models for inverse mappings. The authors propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs across Text-Image and Text-Audio modalities. The experiments show that while models can be guided towards inverse tasks through optimization, the resulting mappings lack semantic meaning and perceptual coherence. The study reveals that while models can align textually with targets, the perceptual quality of the inversions is chaotic. Additionally, when inferring original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings often lack interpretability. This highlights a critical limitation in current multimodal latent spaces, which are optimized for forward tasks and do not support robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Further research is needed to develop truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.23010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse capabilities and broader utility of multimodal latent spaces within task-specific AI (Artificial Intelligence) models. While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g., text-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for inverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based framework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it bidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio (Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.
  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models towards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently support semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings. Experimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that while optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually with targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image captioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized audio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and incoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input from generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently lack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.
  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces, primarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the structure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings. Our work underscores the need for further research into developing truly semantically rich and invertible multimodal latent spaces.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework aimed at optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference through Weight and Activation Quantization (WAQ) with K-Means quantization. Traditional WAQ designs face challenges like accuracy degradation at low precision and activation outliers. KLLM addresses these by implementing an index-based computation scheme for efficient execution, reducing dequantization and full-precision computations. It also includes a novel outlier detection engine, Orizuru, for efficient identification of outlier elements during online inference. Experimental results demonstrate substantial speedups and energy efficiency improvements compared to existing GPU and Atom systems, showcasing the effectiveness of the KLLM framework in enhancing LLM inference performance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.23035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference poses significant challenges due to its intensive memory and computation demands. Weight and activation quantization (WAQ) offers a promising solution by reducing both memory footprint and arithmetic complexity. However, two key challenges remain in the existing WAQ designs. (1) Traditional WAQ designs rely on uniform integer-based quantization for hardware efficiency, but this often results in significant accuracy degradation at low precision. K-Means-based quantization, a non-uniform quantization technique, achieves higher accuracy by matching the Gaussian-like distributions of weights and activations in LLMs. However, its non-uniform nature prevents direct execution on low-precision compute units, requiring dequantization and floating-point matrix multiplications (MatMuls) during inference. (2) Activation outliers further hinder effective low-precision WAQ. Offline thresholding methods for outlier detection can lead to significant model performance degradation, while existing online detection techniques introduce substantial runtime overhead.
  To address the aforementioned challenges and fully unleash the potential of WAQ with K-Means quantization for LLM inference, in this paper, we propose KLLM, a hardware-software co-design framework. KLLM features an index-based computation scheme for efficient execution of MatMuls and nonlinear operations on K-Means-quantized data, which avoids most of the dequantization and full-precision computations. Moreover, KLLM incorporates a novel outlier detection engine, Orizuru, that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ largest and smallest elements in the activation data stream during online inference.
  Extensive experiments show that, on average, KLLM achieves speedups of 9.67x, 7.03x and energy efficiency improvements of 229.50x, 150.21x compared to the A100 GPU and Atom, respectively.

Summary:
This study focuses on the relationship between actor behavior and process outcomes in process mining. Traditional approaches often overlook the temporal and causal dynamics of individual actor behavior, limiting the understanding of real-world processes. By integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality, the study identifies correlating links in time series data. Using Group Lasso for lag selection, a small set of lags that capture causal influence on process performance, particularly throughput time, are identified. The findings suggest that actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process efficiency. This actor-centric, time series-based approach offers a more nuanced understanding of how individual behaviors influence overall process outcomes. <div>

Abstract: Understanding how actor behavior influences process outcomes is a critical aspect of process mining. Traditional approaches often use aggregate and static process data, overlooking the temporal and causal dynamics that arise from individual actor behavior. This limits the ability to accurately capture the complexity of real-world processes, where individual actor behavior and interactions between actors significantly shape performance. In this work, we address this gap by integrating actor behavior analysis with Granger causality to identify correlating links in time series data. We apply this approach to realworld event logs, constructing time series for actor interactions, i.e. continuation, interruption, and handovers, and process outcomes. Using Group Lasso for lag selection, we identify a small but consistently influential set of lags that capture the majority of causal influence, revealing that actor behavior has direct and measurable impacts on process performance, particularly throughput time. These findings demonstrate the potential of actor-centric, time series-based methods for uncovering the temporal dependencies that drive process outcomes, offering a more nuanced understanding of how individual behaviors impact overall process efficiency.

- CatBoost algorithm performed the best with an AUROC of 0.818, sensitivity of 0.800, specificity of 0.681, and negative predictive value of 0.900.
- Key predictors included phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII.

- Bayesian analysis estimated a mean risk of 60.5% in high-risk cases.
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Vancomycin, a key antibiotic for severe Gram-positive infections in ICUs, poses a high nephrotoxicity risk. Early prediction of kidney injury in critically ill patients is challenging. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict vancomycin-related creatinine elevation using routine ICU data.
  Methods: We analyzed 10,288 ICU patients (aged 18-80) from the MIMIC-IV database who received vancomycin. Kidney injury was defined by KDIGO criteria (creatinine rise >=0.3 mg/dL within 48h or >=50% within 7d). Features were selected via SelectKBest (top 30) and Random Forest ranking (final 15). Six algorithms were tested with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability was evaluated using SHAP, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Bayesian posterior sampling.
  Results: Of 10,288 patients, 2,903 (28.2%) developed creatinine elevation. CatBoost performed best (AUROC 0.818 [95% CI: 0.801-0.834], sensitivity 0.800, specificity 0.681, negative predictive value 0.900). Key predictors were phosphate, total bilirubin, magnesium, Charlson index, and APSIII. SHAP confirmed phosphate as a major risk factor. ALE showed dose-response patterns. Bayesian analysis estimated mean risk 60.5% (95% credible interval: 16.8-89.4%) in high-risk cases.
  Conclusions: This machine learning model predicts vancomycin-associated creatinine elevation from routine ICU data with strong accuracy and interpretability, enabling early risk detection and supporting timely interventions in critical care.

Summary:
This study examines the effects of implementing local differential privacy in the thresholding bandit problem, considering fixed budget and fixed confidence scenarios. The proposed methods use private responses from a Bernoulli-based differentially private mechanism to identify arms with expected rewards surpassing a set threshold, ensuring strong privacy guarantees. Theoretical performance bounds for the algorithms are derived, along with general lower bounds on the additional loss incurred by any differentially private mechanism. The algorithms presented in the study match these lower bounds up to poly-logarithmic factors. The results offer valuable insights for privacy-preserving decision-making frameworks in bandit problems.

- Current fracture modeling methods struggle to generalize across different materials and loading conditions.
- A new data-driven model using a transformer-based architecture is introduced for fracture prediction.
- The model can handle various materials and loading conditions, supporting structured and unstructured meshes.

Summary: <br />
Accurately predicting material failure is crucial for safe design under stress, but current models have limitations. A new data-driven model using a transformer-based architecture addresses these issues, offering scalability and adaptability across different materials and loading conditions. This model requires minimal data for training and can generalize to unseen materials with minimal samples, providing a promising alternative to traditional fracture prediction methods. <div>
arXiv:2507.23077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its cutting-edge AI-enabled applications (e.g., autonomous vehicles and smart industries) combine two paradigms: data-driven systems and their deployment on the edge. Usually, edge devices perform inferences to support latency-critical applications. In addition to the performance of these resource-constrained edge devices, their energy usage is a critical factor in adopting and deploying edge applications. Examples of such devices include Raspberry Pi (RPi), Intel Neural Compute Stick (INCS), NVIDIA Jetson nano (NJn), and Google Coral USB (GCU). Despite their adoption in edge deployment for AI inferences, there is no study on their performance and energy usage for informed decision-making on the device and model selection to meet the demands of applications. This study fills the gap by rigorously characterizing the performance of traditional, neural networks, and large language models on the above-edge devices. Specifically, we analyze trade-offs among model F1 score, inference time, inference power, and memory usage.

Summary: BiGG-E is a novel autoregressive model designed to learn a joint distribution over weighted graphs, addressing the limitations of current generative models. It is capable of generating weighted graphs with efficiency, taking into account complex dependencies between edges and their weights. The model extends the BiGG framework and efficiently generates graphs with both topology and edge weights. By leveraging sparsity, BiGG-E can generate weighted graphs with n nodes and m edges in O((n + m)log n) time. Simulation studies and experiments on benchmark datasets show that BiGG-E outperforms existing models in capturing distributions over weighted graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient. The development of BiGG-E represents a significant advancement in the field of generative modeling for weighted graphs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Weighted graphs are ubiquitous throughout biology, chemistry, and the social sciences, motivating the development of generative models for abstract weighted graph data using deep neural networks. However, most current deep generative models are either designed for unweighted graphs and are not easily extended to weighted topologies or incorporate edge weights without consideration of a joint distribution with topology. Furthermore, learning a distribution over weighted graphs must account for complex nonlocal dependencies between both the edges of the graph and corresponding weights of each edge. We develop an autoregressive model BiGG-E, a nontrivial extension of the BiGG model, that learns a joint distribution over weighted graphs while still exploiting sparsity to generate a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges in $O((n + m)\log n)$ time. Simulation studies and experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that BiGG-E best captures distributions over weighted graphs while remaining scalable and computationally efficient.

<div> Keywords: data privacy, federated learning, stragglers, user opt-out, missing data

Summary:
FLOSS is introduced as a system designed to address the challenges of missing data in federated learning systems, specifically in the presence of stragglers and user opt-out scenarios. The system aims to mitigate bias and improve model performance caused by missing data from various sources. While previous research on data privacy in federated learning has focused on preserving privacy for shared data, FLOSS considers the impact of users choosing to opt out of data sharing. By addressing the issue of missing data and stragglers, FLOSS provides a solution to improve the overall performance of federated learning systems. Empirical simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of FLOSS in handling missing data and mitigating bias in model training. Overall, FLOSS offers a novel approach to enhancing data privacy and model performance in federated learning settings.

arXiv:2507.23115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work on data privacy in federated learning systems focuses on privacy-preserving operations for data from users who have agreed to share their data for training. However, modern data privacy agreements also empower users to use the system while opting out of sharing their data as desired. When combined with stragglers that arise from heterogeneous device capabilities, the result is missing data from a variety of sources that introduces bias and degrades model performance. In this paper, we present FLOSS, a system that mitigates the impacts of such missing data on federated learning in the presence of stragglers and user opt-out, and empirically demonstrate its performance in simulations.

arXiv:2507.23128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although prior work in computer vision has shown strong correlations between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracies, such relationships remain underexplored in audio-based models. In this study, we investigate how training conditions and input features affect the robustness and generalization abilities of spoken keyword classifiers under OOD conditions. We benchmark several neural architectures across a variety of evaluation sets. To quantify the impact of noise on generalization, we make use of two metrics: Fairness (F), which measures overall accuracy gains compared to a baseline model, and Robustness (R), which assesses the convergence between ID and OOD performance. Our results suggest that noise-aware training improves robustness in some configurations. These findings shed new light on the benefits and limitations of noise-based augmentation for generalization in speech models.

<div> observational multiplicity, probabilistic classification tasks, regret, safety, data collection
Summary: 
The article discusses the phenomenon of observational multiplicity in probabilistic classification tasks, where multiple models can perform equally well, leading to conflicting predictions. To address this, the concept of regret is introduced as a measure of how predictions could change with different training labels. The authors propose a method to estimate regret in probabilistic classification tasks, showing that regret can be higher for certain groups in the dataset. The concept of regret can be used to promote safety in real-world applications by encouraging abstention and data collection. This approach highlights the importance of evaluating the arbitrariness of individual probability predictions and provides insights into improving interpretability and safety in machine learning models.

Abstract: Many prediction tasks can admit multiple models that can perform almost equally well. This phenomenon can can undermine interpretability and safety when competing models assign conflicting predictions to individuals. In this work, we study how arbitrariness can arise in probabilistic classification tasks as a result of an effect that we call \emph{observational multiplicity}. We discuss how this effect arises in a broad class of practical applications where we learn a classifier to predict probabilities $p_i \in [0,1]$ but are given a dataset of observations $y_i \in \{0,1\}$. We propose to evaluate the arbitrariness of individual probability predictions through the lens of \emph{regret}. We introduce a measure of regret for probabilistic classification tasks, which measures how the predictions of a model could change as a result of different training labels change. We present a general-purpose method to estimate the regret in a probabilistic classification task. We use our measure to show that regret is higher for certain groups in the dataset and discuss potential applications of regret. We demonstrate how estimating regret promote safety in real-world applications by abstention and data collection.

<div> Keywords: differential equations, artificial intelligence, high frequency components, scale-dilation operator, Transformer AI solver

Summary:<br /><br />
This article introduces a new paradigm for solving differential equations (DEs) using artificial intelligence (AI). Traditional AI solvers struggle with high frequency components in DEs due to limited data availability. The proposed methodology involves generating first-principles-consistent training datasets by deriving sources and initial/boundary conditions from solutions. A scale-dilation operator (SDO) is used to handle high frequency components by leveraging the Fourier transform of multiscale solutions. An attention-based Transformer AI solver is designed to solve DEs efficiently. The study proves that the SDO leads to a smoother loss landscape, improving training efficiency. Extensive testing shows that this AI paradigm outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy. This approach makes AI solver of DEs applicable in various fields of nature and engineering. <div>

Abstract: Many problems are governed by differential equations (DEs). Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new path for solving DEs. However, data is very scarce and existing AI solvers struggle with approximation of high frequency components (AHFC). We propose an AI paradigm for solving diverse DEs, including DE-ruled first-principles data generation methodology and scale-dilation operator (SDO) AI solver. Using either prior knowledge or random fields, we generate solutions and then substitute them into the DEs to derive the sources and initial/boundary conditions through balancing DEs, thus producing arbitrarily vast amount of, first-principles-consistent training datasets at extremely low computational cost. We introduce a reversible SDO that leverages the Fourier transform of the multiscale solutions to fix AHFC, and design a spatiotemporally coupled, attention-based Transformer AI solver of DEs with SDO. An upper bound on the Hessian condition number of the loss function is proven to be proportional to the squared 2-norm of the solution gradient, revealing that SDO yields a smoother loss landscape, consequently fixing AHFC with efficient training. Extensive tests on diverse DEs demonstrate that our AI paradigm achieves consistently superior accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. This work makes AI solver of DEs to be truly usable in broad nature and engineering fields.

Summary: 
FuseTen is a novel generative framework designed to produce daily Land Surface Temperature (LST) observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by combining data from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS satellites. The framework uses a generative architecture trained with an averaging-based strategy and incorporates attention and normalization modules for enhanced accuracy.

Experimental results demonstrate that FuseTen surpasses linear baselines, with significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity. This innovative approach marks the first non-linear method capable of generating daily LST estimates at such a high spatial resolution. The framework addresses the critical need for accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions to better understand and assess challenges such as urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation in the context of climate change.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban heatwaves, droughts, and land degradation are pressing and growing challenges in the context of climate change. A valuable approach to studying them requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions. One of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these phenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites and provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's surface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a novel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m spatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative architecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in physical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within the fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism. Experiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear baselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and 31.42% in visual fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-linear method to generate daily LST estimates at such fine spatial resolution.

Summary:
The article discusses the trade-off in designing Language Model (LLM) services, focusing on three essential properties: inference-time budget, factual authenticity, and reasoning capacity. Through analysis, it is concluded that no model can optimize all three properties simultaneously. This trade-off is formally proven, leading to the proposal of a framework called The BAR Theorem for designing LLM applications. The framework aims to provide a principled approach in balancing these properties to meet the requirements of practitioners in the field. The notion of trade-offs in LLM design is highlighted, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and strategic decision-making to achieve the desired outcomes. <div>

Summary: <br />
Sparsity detection in black-box functions for gradient-based optimization faces issues with false negatives due to coincidental zero gradients. NaN-propagation leverages IEEE 754 Not-a-Number values to trace dependencies in numerical computations, effectively eliminating false negatives and detecting missed dependencies. By contaminating inputs with NaN, the method reconstructs accurate sparsity patterns to enhance computational speedups. The approach, demonstrated on an aerospace wing weight model, achieves a 1.52x speedup and improves upon existing black-box sparsity detection methods with faster-than-linear time complexity. The technique is versatile across programming languages and math libraries, making it applicable without modifying existing codes. Advanced strategies, including NaN payload encoding, further enhance the efficiency of sparsity detection, offering significant improvements in optimization workflows. Additionally, practical algorithms are proposed to address challenges from branching code execution in engineering applications. <div>
arXiv:2507.23186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparsity detection in black-box functions enables significant computational speedups in gradient-based optimization through Jacobian compression, but existing finite-difference methods suffer from false negatives due to coincidental zero gradients. These false negatives can silently corrupt gradient calculations, leading to difficult-to-diagnose errors. We introduce NaN-propagation, which exploits the universal contamination property of IEEE 754 Not-a-Number floating-point values to trace input-output dependencies through floating-point numerical computations. By systematically contaminating inputs with NaN and observing which outputs become NaN, the method reconstructs conservative sparsity patterns that eliminate false negatives. We demonstrate the approach on an aerospace wing weight model, achieving a 1.52x speedup while detecting dozens of dependencies missed by conventional methods -- a significant improvement since gradient computation is the bottleneck in many optimization workflows. The technique leverages IEEE 754 compliance to work across programming languages and math libraries without modifying existing black-box codes. Advanced strategies including NaN payload encoding enable faster-than-linear time complexity, improving upon existing black-box sparsity detection methods. Practical algorithms are also proposed to mitigate challenges from branching code execution common in engineering applications.

<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding complex multimodal documents remains challenging due to their structural inconsistencies and limited training data availability. We introduce \textit{DocsRay}, a training-free document understanding system that integrates pseudo Table of Contents (TOC) generation with hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our approach leverages multimodal Large Language Models' (LLMs) native capabilities to seamlessly process documents containing diverse elements such as text, images, charts, and tables without requiring specialized models or additional training. DocsRay's framework synergistically combines three key techniques: (1) a semantic structuring module using prompt-based LLM interactions to generate a hierarchical pseudo-TOC, (2) zero-shot multimodal analysis that converts diverse document elements into unified, text-centric representations using the inherent capabilities of multimodal LLMs, and (3) an efficient two-stage hierarchical retrieval system that reduces retrieval complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(S + k_1 \cdot N_s)$. Evaluated on documents averaging 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens, DocsRay reduced query latency from 3.89 to 2.12 seconds, achieving a 45% efficiency improvement. On the MMLongBench-Doc benchmark, DocsRay-Pro attains an accuracy of 64.7%, substantially surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.

Summary: 
An AI study addresses the challenge of contextual hallucinations in text generation. The research introduces a generator-agnostic observer model that can detect hallucinations through a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual stream. This probe isolates a transferable linear direction that distinguishes hallucinated text from accurate text, outperforming existing methods. The study identifies specific MLP sub-circuits associated with hallucination tracking using gradient-times-activation. It demonstrates that manipulation of this direction can causally control generator hallucination rates, highlighting its practical utility. The findings provide new insights into internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking mechanisms in AI models and offer a benchmark called ContraTales for evaluating detection and mitigation strategies for hallucinations in text generation models. <div>
arXiv:2507.23221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual hallucinations -- statements unsupported by given context -- remain a significant challenge in AI. We demonstrate a practical interpretability insight: a generator-agnostic observer model detects hallucinations via a single forward pass and a linear probe on its residual stream. This probe isolates a single, transferable linear direction separating hallucinated from faithful text, outperforming baselines by 5-27 points and showing robust mid-layer performance across Gemma-2 models (2B to 27B). Gradient-times-activation localises this signal to sparse, late-layer MLP activity. Critically, manipulating this direction causally steers generator hallucination rates, proving its actionability. Our results offer novel evidence of internal, low-dimensional hallucination tracking linked to specific MLP sub-circuits, exploitable for detection and mitigation. We release the 2000-example ContraTales benchmark for realistic assessment of such solutions.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm, aiming to address the issue of efficient machine unlearning by establishing a theoretical connection between forgetting and memorizing in the context of incremental learning. While existing influence-based unlearning methods suffer from computational overhead, IAU leverages gradient optimization techniques to achieve efficient unlearning without the need for time-consuming Hessian computations. The algorithm demonstrates superior removal guarantee, efficiency, and model utility compared to state-of-the-art methods across various datasets and model architectures. The theoretical link between forgetting and memorizing from cognitive science provides a foundation for IAU's approach, highlighting the potential of incremental learning in machine unlearning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.23257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling machine learning models to ``forget" specific training data, has received increasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has emerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of individual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However, this approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the necessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training samples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and scenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the difficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that memorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link between memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This connection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of incremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in unlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on more efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned cognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from the incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that IAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency, and comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets and model architectures.

DynaSwarm is a dynamic framework for enhancing multi-agent systems by optimizing graph structures using an actor-critic reinforcement learning mechanism.

arXiv:2507.23261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current multi-agent systems (MAS) frameworks often rely on manually designed and static collaboration graph structures, limiting adaptability and performance. To address these limitations, we propose DynaSwarm, a dynamic framework that enhances LLM-based MAS through two key innovations: (1) an actor-critic reinforcement learning (A2C) mechanism to optimize graph structures with improved stability over prior RL methods, and (2) a dynamic graph selector that adaptively chooses the optimal graph structure for each input sample via parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning. DynaSwarm eliminates the need for rigid, one-fits-all graph architectures, instead leveraging sample-specific idiosyncrasies to dynamically route queries through specialized agent networks. (c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to fully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on question answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that DynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS baselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance of sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.

Summary:
This paper introduces a dynamic analytical framework to analyze and quantify privacy leakage dynamics in deep learning models at the individual sample level. By tracking a sample's vulnerability throughout training on an FPR-TPR plane, the framework assesses how dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice impact the rate and severity of privacy risks. The study reveals a strong correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning difficulty and its privacy risk in the final trained model, indicating that the vulnerability of samples is primarily determined early in the training process. These findings enhance our understanding of how privacy risks evolve during training and suggest the need for privacy-conscious model training strategies to mitigate membership inference attacks.<hr />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a critical threat to the privacy of training data in deep learning. Despite significant progress in attack methodologies, our understanding of when and how models encode membership information during training remains limited. This paper presents a dynamic analytical framework for dissecting and quantifying privacy leakage dynamics at the individual sample level. By tracking per-sample vulnerabilities on an FPR-TPR plane throughout training, our framework systematically measures how factors such as dataset complexity, model architecture, and optimizer choice influence the rate and severity at which samples become vulnerable. Crucially, we discover a robust correlation between a sample's intrinsic learning difficulty, and find that the privacy risk of samples highly vulnerable in the final trained model is largely determined early during training. Our results thus provide a deeper understanding of how privacy risks dynamically emerge during training, laying the groundwork for proactive, privacy-aware model training strategies.

This API is designed to easily create sequence models that can be executed both layer-by-layer and step-by-step, allowing for flexible training and sampling approaches. The layers in the API define an explicit representation of their state over time and a step method that evolves that state to ensure consistent results. This approach enables complex models to be streamable and reduces common bugs in streaming and parallel sequence processing. The SequenceLayers contract can be implemented in any deep learning library and offers a composable and declarative API with a variety of layers and combinators for building production-scale models. Implementations of SequenceLayers in JAX and TensorFlow 2 are available for use. The goal is to streamline the construction of models using simple, streamable components while maintaining strong correctness guarantees. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce a neural network layer API and library for sequence modeling, designed for easy creation of sequence models that can be executed both layer-by-layer (e.g., teacher-forced training) and step-by-step (e.g., autoregressive sampling). To achieve this, layers define an explicit representation of their state over time (e.g., a Transformer KV cache, a convolution buffer, an RNN hidden state), and a step method that evolves that state, tested to give identical results to a stateless layer-wise invocation. This and other aspects of the SequenceLayers contract enables complex models to be immediately streamable, mitigates a wide range of common bugs arising in both streaming and parallel sequence processing, and can be implemented in any deep learning library. A composable and declarative API, along with a comprehensive suite of layers and combinators, streamlines the construction of production-scale models from simple streamable components while preserving strong correctness guarantees. Our current implementations of SequenceLayers (JAX, TensorFlow 2) are available at https://github.com/google/sequence-layers.

Abstract: Accurately identifying items forgotten during a supermarket visit and providing clear, interpretable explanations for recommending them remains an underexplored problem within the Next Basket Prediction (NBP) domain. Existing NBP approaches typically only focus on forecasting future purchases, without explicitly addressing the detection of unintentionally omitted items. This gap is partly due to the scarcity of real-world datasets that allow for the reliable estimation of forgotten items. Furthermore, most current NBP methods rely on black-box models, which lack transparency and limit the ability to justify recommendations to end users. In this paper, we formally introduce the forgotten item prediction task and propose two novel interpretable-by-design algorithms. These methods are tailored to identify forgotten items while offering intuitive, human-understandable explanations. Experiments on a real-world retail dataset show our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art NBP baselines by 10-15% across multiple evaluation metrics.

Summary:  
Large reasoning models optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL) face challenges due to sparse outcome-only rewards. This study introduces Process Reward Models (PRMs) to enhance RL training for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). By using intrinsic signals at the thought level, PRMs evaluate steps' correctness and segment them into coherent units, improving credit assignment and reducing reward hacking. A capability-adaptive reward mechanism balances exploration and exploitation based on LRMs' proficiency, enhancing learning efficiency. The new off-policy RL algorithm, TP-GRPO, combines grouped proximal optimization with process-based rewards, achieving higher problem-solving accuracy with fewer training samples than baseline methods in math reasoning tasks. Experiments on LRMs with 1.5B and 7B parameters validate the efficacy of structured process rewards in accelerating LRM optimization. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently shown promise in solving complex math problems when optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). But conventional approaches rely on outcome-only rewards that provide sparse feedback, resulting in inefficient optimization process. In this work, we investigate the function of process reward models (PRMs) to accelerate the RL training for LRMs. We propose a novel intrinsic signal-driven generative process evaluation mechanism operating at the thought level to address major bottlenecks in RL-based training. Specifically, instead of requiring PRMs to know how to solve problems, our method uses intrinsic signals in solutions to judge stepwise correctness and aggregate contiguous correct/incorrect steps into coherent 'thought' units. This structured, thought-level rewards enable more reliable credit assignment by reducing ambiguity in step segmentation and alleviating reward hacking. We further introduce a capability-adaptive reward mechanism that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the LRM's current proficiency, guiding learning without stifling creative trial-and-error. These innovations are integrated into a new off-policy RL algorithm, TP-GRPO, which extends grouped proximal optimization with process-based rewards and improves training efficiency. Experiments on 1.5B and 7B parameter LRMs demonstrate that our method achieves higher problem-solving accuracy with significantly fewer training samples than outcome-only reward baselines. The results validate that well-structured process rewards can substantially accelerate LRM optimization in math reasoning tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/cs-holder/tp_grpo.

<div> voting, certification, deep learning, patch robustness, adversarial attacks

Summary:
CostCert is a novel approach for patch robustness certification in deep learning systems, specifically targeting adversarial patch attacks. Unlike existing techniques, CostCert does not rely on pairwise comparisons or exhaustive enumeration to certify the true label within the top k predictions. Instead, it considers the attack budget and the smallest additional votes needed to exclude the true label from the top k predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CostCert outperforms the current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, achieving up to 57.3% certified accuracy retention for a patch size of 96, while PatchGuard drops to zero accuracy. CostCert provides a scalable and precise solution for defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees, enhancing the robustness of deep learning systems against such threats. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patch robustness certification is an emerging verification approach for defending against adversarial patch attacks with provable guarantees for deep learning systems. Certified recovery techniques guarantee the prediction of the sole true label of a certified sample. However, existing techniques, if applicable to top-k predictions, commonly conduct pairwise comparisons on those votes between labels, failing to certify the sole true label within the top k prediction labels precisely due to the inflation on the number of votes controlled by the attacker (i.e., attack budget); yet enumerating all combinations of vote allocation suffers from the combinatorial explosion problem. We propose CostCert, a novel, scalable, and precise voting-based certified recovery defender. CostCert verifies the true label of a sample within the top k predictions without pairwise comparisons and combinatorial explosion through a novel design: whether the attack budget on the sample is infeasible to cover the smallest total additional votes on top of the votes uncontrollable by the attacker to exclude the true labels from the top k prediction labels. Experiments show that CostCert significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art defender PatchGuard, such as retaining up to 57.3% in certified accuracy when the patch size is 96, whereas PatchGuard has already dropped to zero.

<div> dynamic pricing, bike-sharing systems, inventory management, agent-based simulation, user demand

Summary:
Dynamic pricing for bike-sharing systems is crucial for managing inventory imbalance caused by varying user demands. A novel approach using a differentiable agent-based simulation was developed to optimize dynamic pricing, considering the diverse backgrounds and probabilistic choices of users. Validation experiments showed significant improvements over conventional methods, achieving higher accuracy with faster convergence. The approach was further validated in a large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario, demonstrating the ability to induce balanced inventory without manual relocation. The study also highlighted the importance of setting appropriate initial conditions to minimize the cost of discounts for achieving balanced inventory. The findings suggest that the developed dynamic pricing policies can effectively optimize bike-sharing system operations and reduce relocation costs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.23344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bike-sharing systems are emerging in various cities as a new ecofriendly transportation system. In these systems, spatiotemporally varying user demands lead to imbalanced inventory at bicycle stations, resulting in additional relocation costs. Therefore, it is essential to manage user demand through optimal dynamic pricing for the system. However, optimal pricing design for such a system is challenging because the system involves users with diverse backgrounds and their probabilistic choices. To address this problem, we develop a differentiable agent-based simulation to rapidly design dynamic pricing in bike-sharing systems, achieving balanced bicycle inventory despite spatiotemporally heterogeneous trips and probabilistic user decisions. We first validate our approach against conventional methods through numerical experiments involving 25 bicycle stations and five time slots, yielding 100 parameters. Compared to the conventional methods, our approach obtains a more accurate solution with a 73% to 78% reduction in loss while achieving more than a 100-fold increase in convergence speed. We further validate our approach on a large-scale urban bike-sharing system scenario involving 289 bicycle stations, resulting in a total of 1156 parameters. Through simulations using the obtained pricing policies, we confirm that these policies can naturally induce balanced inventory without any manual relocation. Additionally, we find that the cost of discounts to induce the balanced inventory can be minimized by setting appropriate initial conditions.

Abstract: In a world that constantly changes, it is crucial to understand how those changes impact different systems, such as industrial manufacturing or critical infrastructure. Explaining critical changes, referred to as concept drift in the field of machine learning, is the first step towards enabling targeted interventions to avoid or correct model failures, as well as malfunctions and errors in the physical world. Therefore, in this work, we extend model-based drift explanations towards causal explanations, which increases the actionability of the provided explanations. We evaluate our explanation strategy on a number of use cases, demonstrating the practical usefulness of our framework, which isolates the causally relevant features impacted by concept drift and, thus, allows for targeted intervention.

Summary: 
PLARE is a new approach for offline reinforcement learning that utilizes large vision-language models to provide guidance signals for agent training. Unlike traditional methods, PLARE does not require manually designed reward functions, instead querying a VLM for preference labels on visual trajectory segments based on language task descriptions. The policy is trained directly from these preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective, eliminating the need for explicit reward models. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation tasks show that PLARE achieves performance comparable to existing VLM-based methods, and real-world tasks with a physical robot further validate its practicality. <div>

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for training robotic agents using pre-collected, suboptimal datasets, eliminating the need for costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous online interactions. This is particularly useful in safety-critical real-world applications, where online data collection is expensive and impractical. However, existing offline RL algorithms typically require reward labeled data, which introduces an additional bottleneck: reward function design is itself costly, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. In this paper, we introduce PLARE, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to provide guidance signals for agent training. Instead of relying on manually designed reward functions, PLARE queries a VLM for preference labels on pairs of visual trajectory segments based on a language task description. The policy is then trained directly from these preference labels using a supervised contrastive preference learning objective, bypassing the need to learn explicit reward models. Through extensive experiments on robotic manipulation tasks from the MetaWorld, PLARE achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing state-of-the-art VLM-based reward generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PLARE in real-world manipulation tasks with a physical robot, further validating its practical applicability.

This paper introduces a system for detecting adulteration in coconut milk using infrared spectroscopy. The system employs a machine learning approach with three phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. In the preprocessing phase, irrelevant data is removed from the spectral signals of coconut milk.

ST-SSM introduces a novel factorization of the spatial and temporal dimensions, using structured state-space models to independently model temporal evolution and spatial interactions. This design enables parameter efficiency and flexible modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dynamics. A theoretical connection is established between SSMs and neural operators, and a unified universality theorem is proved for the resulting class of architectures. Empirically, we demonstrate that our factorized formulation outperforms alternative schemes such as zigzag scanning and parallel independent processing on several PDE benchmarks, including 1D Burgers' equation, 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations under varying physical conditions. Our model performs competitively with existing baselines while using significantly fewer parameters. In addition, our results reinforce previous findings on the benefits of temporal memory by showing improved performance under partial observability. Our results highlight the advantages of dimensionally factorized operator learning for efficient and generalizable PDE modeling, and put this approach on a firm theoretical footing.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) is an efficient approach to automatically co-optimizing neural network performance and hardware energy efficiency, making it particularly useful for the development of Deep Neural Network accelerators on the edge. However, the extensive search space and high computational cost pose significant challenges to its practical adoption. To address these limitations, we propose Coflex, a novel HW-NAS framework that integrates the Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP) with multi-objective Bayesian optimization. By leveraging sparse inducing points, Coflex reduces the GP kernel complexity from cubic to near-linear with respect to the number of training samples, without compromising optimization performance. This enables scalable approximation of large-scale search space, substantially decreasing computational overhead while preserving high predictive accuracy. We evaluate the efficacy of Coflex across various benchmarks, focusing on accelerator-specific architecture. Our experi- mental results show that Coflex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of network accuracy and Energy-Delay-Product, while achieving a computational speed-up ranging from 1.9x to 9.5x.

Summary:<br /><br />
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent chronic disease that reduces life expectancy. A study of 554 T2DM patients analyzed key survival-associated features and developed a machine learning model, the Extra Survival Trees (EST) model, to predict all-cause mortality risk. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776 and strong predictive performance for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause mortality predictions. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) approach was used to interpret the model's decision-making processes. This model's interpretability allows for potential bedside application, aiding in the identification of high-risk patients and optimizing treatment strategies promptly. <div>

Abstract: Objective. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent non-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy. Accurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for personalizing and optimizing treatment strategies. Research Design and Methods. This study analyzed a cohort of 554 patients (aged 40-87 years) with diagnosed T2DM over a maximum follow-up period of 16.8 years, during which 202 patients (36%) died. Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple machine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause mortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results. The extra survival trees (EST) model, incorporating ten key features, demonstrated the best predictive performance. The model achieved a C-statistic of 0.776, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.86, 0.80, 0.841, and 0.826 for 5-, 10-, 15-, and 16.8-year all-cause mortality predictions, respectively. The SHAP approach was employed to interpret the model's individual decision-making processes. Conclusions. The developed model exhibited strong predictive performance for mortality risk assessment. Its clinically interpretable outputs enable potential bedside application, improving the identification of high-risk patients and supporting timely treatment optimization.

<br />Summary:
Practitioners often overlook structural uncertainty when making decisions based on causal effects. This study examines the importance of considering structural uncertainty and suggests Bayesian model averaging as a methodological solution. The benefits of model averaging are evident when structural uncertainty is moderate to high, causal effects vary significantly between structures, and loss functions are sensitive to the size of the causal effect. The proposed approach is proven to be optimal under certain conditions. By utilizing modern causal discovery methods, practitioners can quantify the necessary information within limits. This framework complements existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a unique source of uncertainty that is commonly neglected in practice. <div>
arXiv:2507.23495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practitioners making decisions based on causal effects typically ignore structural uncertainty. We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X \rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA) as a method for adaptively combining Q-value estimates in off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks. DEA uses fully learnable directional parameters to adjust critic-side conservatism and actor-side policy exploration based on ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors. This allows DEA to adapt aggregation to uncertainty levels and training phases. The effectiveness of DEA is demonstrated across various continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes, showing superior performance to static ensemble strategies. The method shows promise in improving Q-value estimation accuracy and reducing overestimation bias in off-policy reinforcement learning tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.23501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning in continuous control tasks depends critically on accurate $Q$-value estimates. Conservative aggregation over ensembles, such as taking the minimum, is commonly used to mitigate overestimation bias. However, these static rules are coarse, discard valuable information from the ensemble, and cannot adapt to task-specific needs or different learning regimes. We propose Directional Ensemble Aggregation (DEA), an aggregation method that adaptively combines $Q$-value estimates in actor-critic frameworks. DEA introduces two fully learnable directional parameters: one that modulates critic-side conservatism and another that guides actor-side policy exploration. Both parameters are learned using ensemble disagreement-weighted Bellman errors, which weight each sample solely by the direction of its Bellman error. This directional learning mechanism allows DEA to adjust conservatism and exploration in a data-driven way, adapting aggregation to both uncertainty levels and the phase of training. We evaluate DEA across continuous control benchmarks and learning regimes - from interactive to sample-efficient - and demonstrate its effectiveness over static ensemble strategies.

<div> Trade-off, certificate length, verifier runtime, complexity classes, \(\np\), \(\exptime\) <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article explores the relationship between certificate length and verifier runtime, proving a Verifier Trade-off Theorem that establishes a minimum certificate length based on the reduction in verification time for a given language. This theorem introduces a hierarchy of certificate complexity with implications for understanding separations between complexity classes like \(\np\) and \(\exptime\). It also applies this framework to analyze problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. The discussion on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem suggests that the existence of sub-linear certificates could shed light on the resolution of this fundamental computational question. <div>

Abstract: We investigate the trade-off between certificate length and verifier runtime. We prove a Verifier Trade-off Theorem showing that reducing the inherent verification time of a language from \(f(n)\) to \(g(n)\), where \(f(n) \ge g(n)\), requires certificates of length at least \(\Omega(\log(f(n) / g(n)))\). This theorem induces a natural hierarchy based on certificate complexity. We demonstrate its applicability to analyzing conjectured separations between complexity classes (e.g., \(\np\) and \(\exptime\)) and to studying natural problems such as string periodicity and rotation detection. Additionally, we provide perspectives on the \(\p\) vs. \(\np\) problem by relating it to the existence of sub-linear certificates.

<div> DP-Clipped-SGD, high-probability convergence, fixed clipping level, smooth optimization, heavy-tailed noise <br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a new analysis of gradient clipping in Deep Learning, focusing on DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level for both convex and non-convex smooth optimization. The method is designed to handle heavy-tailed noise common in training large language models. The analysis shows that with a fixed clipping level, the method converges faster than existing ones to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. This neighborhood can be adjusted to balance convergence speed with privacy guarantees introduced by Differential Privacy mechanisms. The research provides a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy, solving the issue of incompatible clipping thresholds with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. The results offer valuable insights for optimizing deep learning models and improving privacy protection in training processes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy guarantees.

Summary: 
Continual learning (CL) is a method to address catastrophic forgetting in models trained on multiple tasks sequentially. Experience replay is commonly used but is limited by sparse stored key samples. This study introduces Synthetic Boundary Data (SBD) near decision boundaries during training to act as an implicit regularizer, improving boundary stability. The proposed training framework, Experience Blending, combines knowledge from stored key samples and SBD using a multivariate Differential Privacy noise mechanism to generate SBD and end-to-end training strategy. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet show that the method outperforms nine CL baselines, leading to accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting in models trained sequentially on multiple tasks. While experience replay has shown promise, its effectiveness is often limited by the sparse distribution of stored key samples, leading to overly simplified decision boundaries. We hypothesize that introducing synthetic data near the decision boundary (Synthetic Boundary Data, or SBD) during training serves as an implicit regularizer, improving boundary stability and mitigating forgetting. To validate this hypothesis, we propose a novel training framework, {\bf Experience Blending}, which integrates knowledge from both stored key samples and synthetic, boundary-adjacent data. Experience blending consists of two core components: (1) a multivariate Differential Privacy (DP) noise mechanism that injects batch-wise noise into low-dimensional feature representations, generating SBD; and (2) an end-to-end training strategy that jointly leverages both stored key samples and SBD. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate that our method outperforms nine CL baselines, achieving accuracy improvements of 10%, 6%, and 13%, respectively.

Summary: 
This paper explores the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods on convolutional architectures commonly deployed on edge devices. The study evaluates the performance of popular PEFT methods such as LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore in handling distribution shifts and unseen classes in convolutional models. The research focuses on resource efficiency and compares PEFT methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches using PyTorch profilers. The results show that PEFT methods are not as memory-efficient when applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures compared to large language models (LLMs). However, when targeting convolutional architectures optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can significantly reduce floating-point operations (FLOPs) during model updates. These findings provide valuable insights for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware constraints, performance requirements, and specific application needs. The code used in the study is available online. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods reduce the computational costs of updating deep learning models by minimizing the number of additional parameters used to adapt a model to a down- stream task. While extensively researched in large language models (LLMs), their application to smaller models used on edge devices, such as convolutional neural networks, remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on convolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge environments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and depthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and accommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to compare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT methods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in mind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We find that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when applied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their efficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures optimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating point operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%. These insights offer valuable guidance for selecting PEFT methods based on hardware constraints, performance requirements, and application needs. Our code is online.

Summary: 
The study focuses on fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian Kernel matrices used in attention matrices. The columns of the matrices are indexed by keys, and rows by queries, with an entry formulation based on the Euclidean distance between the queries and keys. The goal is to output a vector with minimal error compared to the original vector in subquadratic time with linear dependence on the dimensionality of the vectors. The algorithms are designed under the assumption that the sum of matrix entries scales linearly with the number of rows, validated through experimental data. The research presents the first subquadratic-time algorithm under this assumption for unrestricted vectors, offering potential applications in fast attention computation for Large Language Models (LLMs). <div>

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$ queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} = e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption, for unrestricted vectors.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise orders-of-magnitude lower power consumption and low-latency inference on neuromorphic hardware for a wide range of robotic tasks. In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm, then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption. Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.

Summary: SA-FDR is a new algorithm for feature selection that approaches the task as a combinatorial optimization problem. It uses simulated annealing to globally search for feature subsets, guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio to evaluate classification model quality efficiently. The algorithm's experiments on large datasets show it consistently selects more compact feature subsets with high predictive accuracy. SA-FDR excels in capturing inter-feature dependencies often overlooked by greedy optimization methods, making it flexible and effective in creating interpretable models in high-dimensional settings where sparsity, interpretability, and performance are key. <div>
arXiv:2507.23568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SA-FDR, a novel algorithm for $\ell_0$-norm feature selection that considers this task as a combinatorial optimisation problem and solves it by using simulated annealing to perform a global search over the space of feature subsets. The optimisation is guided by the Fisher discriminant ratio, which we use as a computationally efficient proxy for model quality in classification tasks. Our experiments, conducted on datasets with up to hundreds of thousands of samples and hundreds of features, demonstrate that SA-FDR consistently selects more compact feature subsets while achieving a high predictive accuracy. This ability to recover informative yet minimal sets of features stems from its capacity to capture inter-feature dependencies often missed by greedy optimisation approaches. As a result, SA-FDR provides a flexible and effective solution for designing interpretable models in high-dimensional settings, particularly when model sparsity, interpretability, and performance are crucial.

<title>GraphRAG-R1: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Process-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2507.23581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has shown great effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs by leveraging graph structures for knowledge representation and modeling complex real-world relationships. However, existing GraphRAG methods still face significant bottlenecks when handling complex problems that require multi-hop reasoning, as their query and retrieval phases are largely based on pre-defined heuristics and do not fully utilize the reasoning potentials of LLMs. To address this problem, we propose GraphRAG-R1, an adaptive GraphRAG framework by training LLMs with process-constrained outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the multi-hop reasoning ability. Our method can decompose complex problems, autonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and perform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking capability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle the shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation (PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the over-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the model performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent training strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start and these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual retrieval to improve the reasoning capacity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GraphRAG-R1 boosts LLM capabilities in solving complex reasoning problems compared to state-of-the-art GraphRAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Furthermore, our framework can be flexibly integrated with various existing retrieval methods, consistently delivering performance improvements.

<title>EB-gMCR: Energy-Based Generative Modeling for Signal Unmixing and Multivariate Curve Resolution</title>

Abstract: Signal unmixing analysis decomposes data into basic patterns and is widely applied in chemical and biological research. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base patterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in understanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix factorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually unknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the scalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This study reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an energy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts from a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable gating network to retain only active components while estimating their concentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent sources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count within 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near exact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity or nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to other instruments or domains without altering the core learning process. By uniting high-capacity generative modeling and hard component selection, EB-gMCR offers a practical route to large-scale signal unmixing analysis, including chemical library-driven scenarios.

Abstract: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods allow for learning scalable multi-agent policies, but suffer from partial observability and induced non-stationarity. These challenges can be addressed by introducing mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically, coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication (e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void, we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.

Abstract: Clinical trials are a systematic endeavor to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs or treatments. Conducting such trials typically demands significant financial investment and meticulous planning, highlighting the need for accurate predictions of trial outcomes. Accurately predicting patient enrollment, a key factor in trial success, is one of the primary challenges during the planning phase. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to address this critical challenge. Our method, implemented as a neural network model, leverages pre-trained language models (PLMs) to capture the complexities and nuances of clinical documents, transforming them into expressive representations. These representations are then combined with encoded tabular features via an attention mechanism. To account for uncertainties in enrollment prediction, we enhance the model with a probabilistic layer based on the Gamma distribution, which enables range estimation. We apply the proposed model to predict clinical trial duration, assuming site-level enrollment follows a Poisson-Gamma process. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world clinical trial data, and show that the proposed method can effectively predict the number of patients enrolled at a number of sites for a given clinical trial, outperforming established baseline models.

Abstract: Data augmentation is gaining importance across various aspects of time series analysis, from forecasting to classification and anomaly detection tasks. We introduce the Latent Generative Transformer Augmentation (L-GTA) model, a generative approach using a transformer-based variational recurrent autoencoder. This model uses controlled transformations within the latent space of the model to generate new time series that preserve the intrinsic properties of the original dataset. L-GTA enables the application of diverse transformations, ranging from simple jittering to magnitude warping, and combining these basic transformations to generate more complex synthetic time series datasets. Our evaluation of several real-world datasets demonstrates the ability of L-GTA to produce more reliable, consistent, and controllable augmented data. This translates into significant improvements in predictive accuracy and similarity measures compared to direct transformation methods.

<title>On the Expressiveness of Softmax Attention: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective</title>

arXiv:2507.23632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern transformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a wide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the quadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the sequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and similar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of softmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from the original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream accuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and key inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other nonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains unanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of softmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using this form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows for the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the importance of each part and how they interact. In this way, our work helps explain why softmax attention is more expressive than its counterparts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed medical institutions while preserving patient privacy, but remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks and statistical heterogeneity. We present OptiGradTrust, a comprehensive defense framework that evaluates gradient updates through a novel six-dimensional fingerprint including VAE reconstruction error, cosine similarity metrics, $L_2$ norm, sign-consistency ratio, and Monte Carlo Shapley value, which drive a hybrid RL-attention module for adaptive trust scoring. To address convergence challenges under data heterogeneity, we develop FedBN-Prox (FedBN-P), combining Federated Batch Normalization with proximal regularization for optimal accuracy-convergence trade-offs. Extensive evaluation across MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Alzheimer's MRI datasets under various Byzantine attack scenarios demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art defenses, achieving up to +1.6 percentage points over FLGuard under non-IID conditions while maintaining robust performance against diverse attack patterns through our adaptive learning approach.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have become instrumental in understanding machine learning models, but their role in guiding model optimization remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a SHAP-guided regularization framework that incorporates feature importance constraints into model training to enhance both predictive performance and interpretability. Our approach applies entropy-based penalties to encourage sparse, concentrated feature attributions while promoting stability across samples. The framework is applicable to both regression and classification tasks. Our first exploration started with investigating a tree-based model regularization using TreeSHAP. Through extensive experiments on benchmark regression and classification datasets, we demonstrate that our method improves generalization performance while ensuring robust and interpretable feature attributions. The proposed technique offers a novel, explainability-driven regularization approach, making machine learning models both more accurate and more reliable.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have achieved great success in online reinforcement learning (RL) due to their strong expressive capacity. However, the inference of diffusion policy models relies on a slow iterative sampling process, which limits their responsiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Mirror Descent (FPMD), an online RL algorithm that enables 1-step sampling during policy inference. Our approach exploits a theoretical connection between the distribution variance and the discretization error of single-step sampling in straight interpolation flow matching models, and requires no extra distillation or consistency training. We present two algorithm variants based on flow policy and MeanFlow policy parametrizations, respectively. Extensive empirical evaluations on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithms show strong performance comparable to diffusion policy baselines while requiring hundreds of times fewer function evaluations during inference.

Abstract: Microbiome data analysis is essential for understanding host health and disease, yet its inherent sparsity and noise pose major challenges for accurate imputation, hindering downstream tasks such as biomarker discovery. Existing imputation methods, including recent diffusion-based models, often fail to capture the complex interdependencies between microbial taxa and overlook contextual metadata that can inform imputation. We introduce DepMicroDiff, a novel framework that combines diffusion-based generative modeling with a Dependency-Aware Transformer (DAT) to explicitly capture both mutual pairwise dependencies and autoregressive relationships. DepMicroDiff is further enhanced by VAE-based pretraining across diverse cancer datasets and conditioning on patient metadata encoded via a large language model (LLM). Experiments on TCGA microbiome datasets show that DepMicroDiff substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher Pearson correlation (up to 0.712), cosine similarity (up to 0.812), and lower RMSE and MAE across multiple cancer types, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability for microbiome imputation.

<title>Anomalous Samples for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Several anomaly detection and classification methods rely on large amounts of non-anomalous or "normal" samples under the assump- tion that anomalous data is typically harder to acquire. This hypothesis becomes questionable in Few-Shot settings, where as little as one anno- tated sample can make a significant difference. In this paper, we tackle the question of utilizing anomalous samples in training a model for bi- nary anomaly classification. We propose a methodology that incorporates anomalous samples in a multi-score anomaly detection score leveraging recent Zero-Shot and memory-based techniques. We compare the utility of anomalous samples to that of regular samples and study the benefits and limitations of each. In addition, we propose an augmentation-based validation technique to optimize the aggregation of the different anomaly scores and demonstrate its effectiveness on popular industrial anomaly detection datasets.

<title>Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System</title>

Abstract: This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors, aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster. Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels. This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS. The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators, and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.

Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at https://github.com/justinkay/coda.

Abstract: To formalize calculations in linear algebra for the development of efficient algorithms and a framework suitable for functional programming languages and faster parallelized computations, we adopt an approach that treats elements of linear algebra, such as matrices, as morphisms in the category of matrices, $\mathbf{Mat_{k}}$. This framework is further extended by generalizing the results to arbitrary monoidal semiadditive categories. To enrich this perspective and accommodate higher-rank matrices (tensors), we define semiadditive 2-categories, where matrices $T_{ij}$ are represented as 1-morphisms, and tensors with four indices $T_{ijkl}$ as 2-morphisms. This formalization provides an index-free, typed linear algebra framework that includes matrices and tensors with up to four indices. Furthermore, we extend the framework to monoidal semiadditive 2-categories and demonstrate detailed operations and vectorization within the 2-category of 2Vec introduced by Kapranov and Voevodsky.

<title>DNN-based Methods of Jointly Sensing Number and Directions of Targets via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver</title>

Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.

Abstract: Rapid growth of digital transactions has led to a surge in fraudulent activities, challenging traditional detection methods in the financial sector. To tackle this problem, we introduce a specialised federated learning framework that uniquely combines a quantum-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with advanced privacy preserving techniques. By integrating quantum layers into the LSTM architecture, our approach adeptly captures complex cross-transactional patters, resulting in an approximate 5% performance improvement across key evaluation metrics compared to conventional models. Central to our framework is "FedRansel", a novel method designed to defend against poisoning and inference attacks, thereby reducing model degradation and inference accuracy by 4-8%, compared to standard differential privacy mechanisms. This pseudo-centralised setup with a Quantum LSTM model, enhances fraud detection accuracy and reinforces the security and confidentiality of sensitive financial data.

<title>A Language Model-Driven Semi-Supervised Ensemble Framework for Illicit Market Detection Across Deep/Dark Web and Social Platforms</title>

Abstract: Illegal marketplaces have increasingly shifted to concealed parts of the internet, including the deep and dark web, as well as platforms such as Telegram, Reddit, and Pastebin. These channels enable the anonymous trade of illicit goods including drugs, weapons, and stolen credentials. Detecting and categorizing such content remains challenging due to limited labeled data, the evolving nature of illicit language, and the structural heterogeneity of online sources. This paper presents a hierarchical classification framework that combines fine-tuned language models with a semi-supervised ensemble learning strategy to detect and classify illicit marketplace content across diverse platforms. We extract semantic representations using ModernBERT, a transformer model for long documents, finetuned on domain-specific data from deep and dark web pages, Telegram channels, Subreddits, and Pastebin pastes to capture specialized jargon and ambiguous linguistic patterns. In addition, we incorporate manually engineered features such as document structure, embedded patterns including Bitcoin addresses, emails, and IPs, and metadata, which complement language model embeddings. The classification pipeline operates in two stages. The first stage uses a semi-supervised ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM with entropy-based weighted voting to detect sales-related documents. The second stage further classifies these into drug, weapon, or credential sales. Experiments on three datasets, including our multi-source corpus, DUTA, and CoDA, show that our model outperforms several baselines, including BERT, ModernBERT, DarkBERT, ALBERT, Longformer, and BigBird. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.96489, an F1-score of 0.93467, and a TMCC of 0.95388, demonstrating strong generalization, robustness under limited supervision, and effectiveness in real-world illicit content detection.

Abstract: We investigate feature universality in Gemma-2 language models (Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B), asking whether models with a four-fold difference in scale still converge on comparable internal concepts. Using the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) dictionary-learning pipeline, we utilize SAEs on each model's residual-stream activations, align the resulting monosemantic features via activation correlation, and compare the matched feature spaces with SVCCA and RSA. Middle layers yield the strongest overlap, while early and late layers show far less similarity. Preliminary experiments extend the analysis from single tokens to multi-token subspaces, showing that semantically similar subspaces interact similarly with language models. These results strengthen the case that large language models carve the world into broadly similar, interpretable features despite size differences, reinforcing universality as a foundation for cross-model interpretability.

Abstract: Electronic medical reports (EHR) contain a vast amount of information that can be leveraged for machine learning applications in healthcare. However, existing survival analysis methods often struggle to effectively handle the complexity of textual data, particularly in its sequential form. Here, we propose SigBERT, an innovative temporal survival analysis framework designed to efficiently process a large number of clinical reports per patient. SigBERT processes timestamped medical reports by extracting and averaging word embeddings into sentence embeddings. To capture temporal dynamics from the time series of sentence embedding coordinates, we apply signature extraction from rough path theory to derive geometric features for each patient, which significantly enhance survival model performance by capturing complex temporal dynamics. These features are then integrated into a LASSO-penalized Cox model to estimate patient-specific risk scores. The model was trained and evaluated on a real-world oncology dataset from the L\'eon B\'erard Center corpus, with a C-index score of 0.75 (sd 0.014) on the independent test cohort. SigBERT integrates sequential medical data to enhance risk estimation, advancing narrative-based survival analysis.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents transformative opportunities for education, generating numerous novel application scenarios. However, significant challenges remain: evaluation metrics vary substantially across different educational scenarios, while many emerging scenarios lack appropriate assessment metrics. Current benchmarks predominantly measure general intelligence rather than pedagogical capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce ELMES, an open-source automated evaluation framework specifically designed for assessing LLMs in educational settings. ELMES features a modular architecture that enables researchers to create dynamic, multi-agent dialogues through simple configuration files, facilitating flexible scenario design without requiring extensive programming expertise. The framework incorporates a hybrid evaluation engine that objectively quantifies traditionally subjective pedagogical metrics using an LLM-as-a-Judge methodology. We conduct systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art LLMs across four critical educational scenarios: Knowledge Point Explanation, Guided Problem-Solving Teaching, Interdisciplinary Lesson Plan Generation, and Contextualized Question Generation, employing fine-grained metrics developed in collaboration with education specialists. Our results demonstrate distinct capability distributions among models, revealing context-specific strengths and limitations. ELMES provides educators and researchers with an accessible evaluation framework that significantly reduces adaptation barriers for diverse educational applications while advancing the practical implementation of LLMs in pedagogy. The framework is publicly available at \emph{https://github.com/sii-research/elmes.git}.

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) lacks formalization and consistent evaluations, hindering reproducibility and cross-study comparisons. This paper argues for a unified approach to post-hoc explainability in KGC. First, we propose a general framework to characterize post-hoc explanations via multi-objective optimization, balancing their effectiveness and conciseness. This unifies existing post-hoc explainability algorithms in KGC and the explanations they produce. Next, we suggest and empirically support improved evaluation protocols using popular metrics like Mean Reciprocal Rank and Hits@$k$. Finally, we stress the importance of interpretability as the ability of explanations to address queries meaningful to end-users. By unifying methods and refining evaluation standards, this work aims to make research in KGC explainability more reproducible and impactful.

Abstract: Label placement is a critical aspect of map design, serving as a form of spatial annotation that directly impacts clarity and interpretability. Despite its importance, label placement remains largely manual and difficult to scale, as existing automated systems struggle to integrate cartographic conventions, adapt to context, or interpret labeling instructions. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates the task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs) for context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate MAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world maps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from open-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each landmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them into prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label coordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall performance and generalization across different types of landmarks. This includes both zero-shot and instruction-tuned performance. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by structured prompts and domain-specific retrieval, can learn to perform accurate spatial edits, aligning the generated outputs with expert cartographic standards. Overall, our work presents a scalable framework for AI-assisted map finishing and demonstrates the potential of foundation models in structured data editing tasks. The code and data can be found at https://github.com/HarryShomer/MAPLE.

Abstract: Community detection in social network graphs plays a vital role in uncovering group dynamics, influence pathways, and the spread of information. Traditional methods focus primarily on graph structural properties, but recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new avenues for integrating semantic and contextual information into this task. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation into how various LLM-based approaches perform in identifying communities within social graphs. We introduce a two-step framework called CommLLM, which leverages the GPT-4o model along with prompt-based reasoning to fuse language model outputs with graph structure. Evaluations are conducted on six real-world social network datasets, measuring performance using key metrics such as Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Variation of Information (VOI), and cluster purity. Our findings reveal that LLMs, particularly when guided by graph-aware strategies, can be successfully applied to community detection tasks in small to medium-sized graphs. We observe that the integration of instruction-tuned models and carefully engineered prompts significantly improves the accuracy and coherence of detected communities. These insights not only highlight the potential of LLMs in graph-based research but also underscore the importance of tailoring model interactions to the specific structure of graph data.

Abstract: Dormant tree pruning is labor-intensive but essential to maintaining modern highly-productive fruit orchards. In this work we present a closed-loop visuomotor controller for robotic pruning. The controller guides the cutter through a cluttered tree environment to reach a specified cut point and ensures the cutters are perpendicular to the branch. We train the controller using a novel orchard simulation that captures the geometric distribution of branches in a target apple orchard configuration. Unlike traditional methods requiring full 3D reconstruction, our controller uses just optical flow images from a wrist-mounted camera. We deploy our learned policy in simulation and the real-world for an example V-Trellis envy tree with zero-shot transfer, achieving a 30% success rate -- approximately half the performance of an oracle planner.

Abstract: We consider the phase retrieval problem, which involves recovering a rank-one positive semidefinite matrix from rank-one measurements. A recently proposed algorithm based on Bures-Wasserstein gradient descent (BWGD) exhibits superlinear convergence, but it is unstable, and existing theory can only prove local linear convergence for higher rank matrix recovery. We resolve this gap by revealing that BWGD implements Newton's method with a nonsmooth and nonconvex objective. We develop a smoothing framework that regularizes the objective, enabling a stable method with rigorous superlinear convergence guarantees. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate this superior stability while maintaining fast convergence.

Abstract: This paper examines how Data Readiness for AI (DRAI) principles apply to leadership-scale scientific datasets used to train foundation models. We analyze archetypal workflows across four representative domains - climate, nuclear fusion, bio/health, and materials - to identify common preprocessing patterns and domain-specific constraints. We introduce a two-dimensional readiness framework composed of Data Readiness Levels (raw to AI-ready) and Data Processing Stages (ingest to shard), both tailored to high performance computing (HPC) environments. This framework outlines key challenges in transforming scientific data for scalable AI training, emphasizing transformer-based generative models. Together, these dimensions form a conceptual maturity matrix that characterizes scientific data readiness and guides infrastructure development toward standardized, cross-domain support for scalable and reproducible AI for science.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model.
  On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate.
  Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Despite advances in large language model (LLM)-based natural language interfaces for databases, scaling to enterprise-level data catalogs remains an under-explored challenge. Prior works addressing this challenge rely on domain-specific fine-tuning - complicating deployment - and fail to leverage important semantic context contained within database metadata. To address these limitations, we introduce a component-based retrieval architecture that decomposes database schemas and metadata into discrete semantic units, each separately indexed for targeted retrieval. Our approach prioritizes effective table identification while leveraging column-level information, ensuring the total number of retrieved tables remains within a manageable context budget. Experiments demonstrate that our method maintains high recall and accuracy, with our system outperforming baselines over massive databases with varying structure and available metadata. Our solution enables practical text-to-SQL systems deployable across diverse enterprise settings without specialized fine-tuning, addressing a critical scalability gap in natural language database interfaces.

<title>On the Complexity of Finding Stationary Points in Nonconvex Simple Bilevel Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23155</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of solving a simple bilevel optimization problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized over the solution set of the lower-level problem. We focus on the general setting in which both the upper- and lower-level objectives are smooth but potentially nonconvex. Due to the absence of additional structural assumptions for the lower-level objective-such as convexity or the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition-guaranteeing global optimality is generally intractable. Instead, we introduce a suitable notion of stationarity for this class of problems and aim to design a first-order algorithm that finds such stationary points in polynomial time. Intuitively, stationarity in this setting means the upper-level objective cannot be substantially improved locally without causing a larger deterioration in the lower-level objective. To this end, we show that a simple and implementable variant of the dynamic barrier gradient descent (DBGD) framework can effectively solve the considered nonconvex simple bilevel problems up to stationarity. Specifically, to reach an $(\epsilon_f, \epsilon_g)$-stationary point-where $\epsilon_f$ and $\epsilon_g$ denote the target stationarity accuracies for the upper- and lower-level objectives, respectively-the considered method achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(\max\left(\epsilon_f^{-\frac{3+p}{1+p}}, \epsilon_g^{-\frac{3+p}{2}}\right)\right)$, where $p \geq 0$ is an arbitrary constant balancing the terms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complexity result for a discrete-time algorithm that guarantees joint stationarity for both levels in general nonconvex simple bilevel problems.

Abstract: The development of novel transparent conducting materials (TCMs) is essential for enhancing the performance and reducing the cost of next-generation devices such as solar cells and displays. In this research, we focus on the (Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ system and extend the FMA framework, which combines a Factorization Machine (FM) and annealing, to search for optimal compositions and crystal structures with high accuracy and low cost. The proposed method introduces (i) the binarization of continuous variables, (ii) the utilization of good solutions using a Hopfield network, (iii) the activation of global search through adaptive random flips, and (iv) fine-tuning via a bit-string local search. Validation using the (Al$_x$Ga$_y$In$_z$)$_2$O$_3$ data from the Kaggle "Nomad2018 Predicting Transparent Conductors" competition demonstrated that our method achieves faster and more accurate searches than Bayesian optimization and genetic algorithms. Furthermore, its application to multi-objective optimization showed its capability in designing materials by simultaneously considering both the band gap and formation energy. These results suggest that applying our method to larger, more complex search problems and diverse material designs that reflect realistic experimental conditions is expected to contribute to the further advancement of materials informatics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific abilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial for enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble methods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which overlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different contexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from Neural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by analyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear confidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized probabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model predictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not require modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional computation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean question-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble methods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal representations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and can be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.

Abstract: The demand for AI-generated GPU kernels is rapidly growing, influenced by the need for scalable, hardware-optimized solutions in both industry and academia. As deep learning workloads grow in complexity and diversity, it is imperative to automate low-level kernel development to meet performance and productivity demands. Major cloud providers, semiconductor companies, and research institutions are now investing heavily in AI-driven code generation for GPUs, aiming to reduce manual optimization efforts while achieving near-expert performance on hardware like AMD MI300X. The Triton language, a Python-based DSL for GPU programming, has emerged as a popular target for such AI-generated kernels due to its balance of performance and ease-of-coding. In this work, we present an evaluation suite for Triton-based GPU kernels and GEAK (Generating Efficient AI-centric GPU Kernels)-a framework that leverages cutting-edge LLMs to generate performant Triton code specifically for AMD GPUs, including the AMD MI300X and MI250. GEAK leverages inference-time compute scaling to produce Triton-based GPU kernels using a reasoning loop adapted from Reflexion-style feedback mechanisms. On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly outperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as Reflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and execution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of GEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse hardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.

<title>Are Recommenders Self-Aware? Label-Free Recommendation Performance Estimation via Model Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the recommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a label-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more informed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with any users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method, probability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures uncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a certain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items. We validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings: (1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with popular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results show that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series of label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable insights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and inference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation uncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and self-evaluating recommender systems.

<title>Not Just What, But When: Integrating Irregular Intervals to LLM for Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However, dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not only the history within a user but also different users with the same item history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items, and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation tasks. Our code is available here: https://github.com/sony/ds-research-code/tree/master/recsys25-IntervalLLM.

<title>Model Directions, Not Words: Mechanistic Topic Models Using Sparse Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Traditional topic models are effective at uncovering latent themes in large text collections. However, due to their reliance on bag-of-words representations, they struggle to capture semantically abstract features. While some neural variants use richer representations, they are similarly constrained by expressing topics as word lists, which limits their ability to articulate complex topics. We introduce Mechanistic Topic Models (MTMs), a class of topic models that operate on interpretable features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs). By defining topics over this semantically rich space, MTMs can reveal deeper conceptual themes with expressive feature descriptions. Moreover, uniquely among topic models, MTMs enable controllable text generation using topic-based steering vectors. To properly evaluate MTM topics against word-list-based approaches, we propose \textit{topic judge}, an LLM-based pairwise comparison evaluation framework. Across five datasets, MTMs match or exceed traditional and neural baselines on coherence metrics, are consistently preferred by topic judge, and enable effective steering of LLM outputs.

Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, requires analysis of heterogeneous biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging, genetic risk factors, cognitive tests, and cerebrospinal fluid proteins) typically represented in a tabular format. With flexible few-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based interpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a novel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts TableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for business intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data with small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using in-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes TableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary classification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework harnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the encoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose LLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first application of LLMs to the prediction task using tabular biomarker data, paving the way for future LLM-driven multi-agent frameworks in biomedical informatics.

<title>Generalized Reinforcement Learning for Retriever-Specific Query Rewriter with Unstructured Real-World Documents</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on effective query formulation to unlock external knowledge, yet optimizing queries for diverse, unstructured real-world documents remains a challenge. We introduce \textbf{RL-QR}, a reinforcement learning framework for retriever-specific query rewriting that eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets and extends applicability to both text-only and multi-modal databases. By synthesizing scenario-question pairs and leveraging Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), RL-QR trains query rewriters tailored to specific retrievers, enhancing retrieval performance across varied domains. Experiments on industrial in-house data demonstrate significant improvements, with $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{multi-modal}}$ achieving an 11\% relative gain in NDCG@3 for multi-modal RAG and $\text{RL-QR}_{\text{lexical}}$ yielding a 9\% gain for lexical retrievers. However, challenges persist with semantic and hybrid retrievers, where rewriters failed to improve performance, likely due to training misalignments. Our findings highlight RL-QR's potential to revolutionize query optimization for RAG systems, offering a scalable, annotation-free solution for real-world retrieval tasks, while identifying avenues for further refinement in semantic retrieval contexts.

Abstract: Bengali is an underrepresented language in NLP research. However, it remains a challenge due to its unique linguistic structure and computational constraints. In this work, we systematically investigate the challenges that hinder Bengali NLP performance by focusing on the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language Models (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive error analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal consistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for smaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified promising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain more stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse relationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend to perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient \& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings highlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the need for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to multilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for underrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language technologies worldwide. The code and dataset used in this research is publicly available at https://github.com/BengaliAI/bn-llm-benchmark.

Abstract: Precise modeling of detector energy response is crucial for next-generation neutrino experiments which present computational challenges due to lack of analytical likelihoods. We propose a solution using neural likelihood estimation within the simulation-based inference framework. We develop two complementary neural density estimators that model likelihoods of calibration data: conditional normalizing flows and a transformer-based regressor. We adopt JUNO - a large neutrino experiment - as a case study. The energy response of JUNO depends on several parameters, all of which should be tuned, given their non-linear behavior and strong correlations in the calibration data. To this end, we integrate the modeled likelihoods with Bayesian nested sampling for parameter inference, achieving uncertainties limited only by statistics with near-zero systematic biases. The normalizing flows model enables unbinned likelihood analysis, while the transformer provides an efficient binned alternative. By providing both options, our framework offers flexibility to choose the most appropriate method for specific needs. Finally, our approach establishes a template for similar applications across experimental neutrino and broader particle physics.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation, regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed, while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines. All code and training logs are publicly accessible at https://github.com/VineetKumarRakesh/lcnn-opt.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Issue resolution has made remarkable progress thanks to the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recently, agent-based frameworks such as SWE-agent have further advanced this progress by enabling autonomous, tool-using agents to tackle complex software engineering tasks. While existing agent-based issue resolution approaches are primarily based on agents' independent explorations, they often get stuck in local solutions and fail to identify issue patterns that span across different parts of the codebase. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Debate, a competitive multi-agent debate framework that encourages diverse reasoning paths and achieves more consolidated issue localization. SWE-Debate first creates multiple fault propagation traces as localization proposals by traversing a code dependency graph. Then, it organizes a three-round debate among specialized agents, each embodying distinct reasoning perspectives along the fault propagation trace. This structured competition enables agents to collaboratively converge on a consolidated fix plan. Finally, this consolidated fix plan is integrated into an MCTS-based code modification agent for patch generation. Experiments on the SWE-bench benchmark show that SWE-Debate achieves new state-of-the-art results in open-source agent frameworks and outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Individualized treatment rules (ITRs) have gained significant attention due to their wide-ranging applications in fields such as precision medicine, ridesharing, and advertising recommendations. However, when ITRs are influenced by sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or age, they can lead to outcomes where certain groups are unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. To address this gap, we propose a flexible approach based on the optimal transport theory, which is capable of transforming any optimal ITR into a fair ITR that ensures demographic parity. Recognizing the potential loss of value under fairness constraints, we introduce an ``improved trade-off ITR," designed to balance value optimization and fairness while accommodating varying levels of fairness through parameter adjustment. To maximize the value of the improved trade-off ITR under specific fairness levels, we propose a smoothed fairness constraint for estimating the adjustable parameter. Additionally, we establish a theoretical upper bound on the value loss for the improved trade-off ITR. We demonstrate performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation studies and application to the Next 36 entrepreneurial program dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in software issue resolution, leveraging advanced techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, current agents act as memoryless explorers - treating each problem separately without retaining or reusing knowledge from previous repair experiences. This leads to redundant exploration of failed trajectories and missed chances to adapt successful issue resolution methods to similar problems. To address this problem, we introduce SWE-Exp, an experience - enhanced approach that distills concise and actionable experience from prior agent trajectories, enabling continuous learning across issues. Our method introduces a multi-faceted experience bank that captures both successful and failed repair attempts. Specifically, it extracts reusable issue resolution knowledge at different levels - from high-level problem comprehension to specific code changes. Experiments show that SWE-Exp achieves state-of-the-art resolution rate (41.6% Pass@1) on SWE-bench-Verified under open-source agent frameworks. Our approach establishes a new paradigm in which automated software engineering agents systematically accumulate and leverage repair expertise, fundamentally shifting from trial-and-error exploration to strategic, experience-driven issue resolution.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a promising direction in representation learning. However, current vision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify clinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their inherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically depend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for small-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive Grouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics from paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping mechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we compute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each token selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch selects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive grouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped Threshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping thresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages based on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation, we introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each image-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a Bidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method achieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks under both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based system for automatically detecting honey adulteration with sugar syrup, based on honey hyperspectral imaging data. First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a botanical origin identification subsystem. Then, the sugar syrup adulteration is identified, and its concentration is quantified by an adulteration detection subsystem. Both subsystems consist of two steps. The first step involves extracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). In the second step, we utilize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to classify the honey botanical origin in the first subsystem and identify the adulteration level in the second subsystem. We assess the proposed system performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result indicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an overall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate alternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.

<title>Adjoint-Based Aerodynamic Shape Optimization with a Manifold Constraint Learned by Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: We introduce an adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization framework that integrates a diffusion model trained on existing designs to learn a smooth manifold of aerodynamically viable shapes. This manifold is enforced as an equality constraint to the shape optimization problem. Central to our method is the computation of adjoint gradients of the design objectives (e.g., drag and lift) with respect to the manifold space. These gradients are derived by first computing shape derivatives with respect to conventional shape design parameters (e.g., Hicks-Henne parameters) and then backpropagating them through the diffusion model to its latent space via automatic differentiation. Our framework preserves mathematical rigor and can be integrated into existing adjoint-based design workflows with minimal modification. Demonstrated on extensive transonic RANS airfoil design cases using off-the-shelf and general-purpose nonlinear optimizers, our approach eliminates ad hoc parameter tuning and variable scaling, maintains robustness across initialization and optimizer choices, and achieves superior aerodynamic performance compared to conventional approaches. This work establishes how AI generated priors integrates effectively with adjoint methods to enable robust, high-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization through automatic differentiation.

Abstract: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are fast-growing fields of research in which data is used to train algorithms, learn patterns, and make predictions. This approach helps to solve seemingly intricate problems with significant accuracy without explicit programming by recognizing complex relationships in data. Taking an example of 5824 chest X-ray images, we implement two machine learning algorithms, namely, a baseline convolutional neural network (CNN) and a DenseNet-121, and present our analysis in making machine-learned predictions in predicting patients with ailments. Both baseline CNN and DenseNet-121 perform very well in the binary classification problem presented in this work. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that DenseNet-121 correctly focuses on essential parts of the input chest X-ray images in its decision-making more than the baseline CNN.

<title>H-RDT: Human Manipulation Enhanced Bimanual Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge: the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent robotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to increase data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse morphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified training challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics Diffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data to enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale egocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations provide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and can benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training paradigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data, and (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action encoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B parameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions. Extensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments, single-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and robustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from scratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving significant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in simulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our core hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation for learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.

Abstract: This study demonstrates that incorporating a consistency heuristic into the point-matching algorithm \cite{yerebakan2023hierarchical} improves robustness in matching anatomical locations across pairs of medical images. We validated our approach on diverse longitudinal internal and public datasets spanning CT and MRI modalities. Notably, it surpasses state-of-the-art results on the Deep Lesion Tracking dataset. Additionally, we show that the method effectively addresses landmark localization. The algorithm operates efficiently on standard CPU hardware and allows configurable trade-offs between speed and robustness. The method enables high-precision navigation between medical images without requiring a machine learning model or training data.

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced from text-to-image (T2I) to image-to-image (I2I) generation by incorporating structured inputs such as depth maps, enabling fine-grained spatial control. However, existing methods either train separate models for each condition or rely on unified architectures with entangled representations, resulting in poor generalization and high adaptation costs for novel conditions. To this end, we propose DivControl, a decomposable pretraining framework for unified controllable generation and efficient adaptation. DivControl factorizes ControlNet via SVD into basic components-pairs of singular vectors-which are disentangled into condition-agnostic learngenes and condition-specific tailors through knowledge diversion during multi-condition training. Knowledge diversion is implemented via a dynamic gate that performs soft routing over tailors based on the semantics of condition instructions, enabling zero-shot generalization and parameter-efficient adaptation to novel conditions. To further improve condition fidelity and training efficiency, we introduce a representation alignment loss that aligns condition embeddings with early diffusion features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivControl achieves state-of-the-art controllability with 36.4$\times$ less training cost, while simultaneously improving average performance on basic conditions. It also delivers strong zero-shot and few-shot performance on unseen conditions, demonstrating superior scalability, modularity, and transferability.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical imaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and hardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation framework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA efficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral similarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI segmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates independently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on publicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a neurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative porcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's effectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal training examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with different spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for hyperspectral medical image analysis.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a popular paradigm for learning robot manipulation policies that can follow language instructions and generalize to novel scenarios. Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.

<title>DICOM De-Identification via Hybrid AI and Rule-Based Framework for Scalable, Uncertainty-Aware Redaction</title>

Abstract: Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data.
  Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text, extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage residual risks.
  This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical, and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) often contain sufficient information to support the inference of new facts. Identifying logical rules not only improves the completeness of a knowledge graph but also enables the detection of potential errors, reveals subtle data patterns, and enhances the overall capacity for reasoning and interpretation. However, the complexity of such rules, combined with the unique labeling conventions of each KG, can make them difficult for humans to understand. In this paper, we explore the potential of large language models to generate natural language explanations for logical rules. Specifically, we extract logical rules using the AMIE 3.5.1 rule discovery algorithm from the benchmark dataset FB15k-237 and two large-scale datasets, FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. We examine various prompting strategies, including zero- and few-shot prompting, including variable entity types, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive human evaluation of the generated explanations based on correctness, clarity, and hallucination, and also assess the use of large language models as automatic judges. Our results demonstrate promising performance in terms of explanation correctness and clarity, although several challenges remain for future research.

Abstract: A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments. Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy, demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data. Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features. These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.

Abstract: In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with information from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source datasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However, existing methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations where the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be well-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the empirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target parameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the Bayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer conditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single joint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as the target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty quantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over indicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how a particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a transformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our approach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently proposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an approximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate superior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a genetics application, especially when the source data are limited.

Abstract: AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) hold enormous promise, but current practice focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also suffers from the fundamental limitations of autoregressive LLMs. On the other hand, humans are general agents who reason by mentally simulating the outcomes of their actions and plans. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of optimal agent in any environment, \modelname overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language. Experiments on difficult web browsing tasks show that \modelname improves the success of flight search from 0\% to 32.2\%. World-model-based planning, in particular, shows consistent advantage of up to 124\% over autoregressive planning, demonstrating the advantage of world model simulation as a reasoning paradigm. We are excited about the possibility for training a single, general agent model based on LLMs that can act superintelligently in all environments. To start, we make SimuRA, a web-browsing agent built on \modelname with pretrained LLMs, available as a research demo for public testing.

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will be released.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33 bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models, contributing to the development of more robust methods.

Abstract: We propose methods for auditing multiclass classifiers for fairness under multiclass equalized odds,by estimating the deviation from equalized odds when the classifier is not completely fair. We generalize to multiclass classifiers the measure of Disparate Conditional Prediction (DCP), originally suggested by Sabato & Yom-Tov (2020) for binary classifiers. DCP is defined as the fraction of the population for which the classifier predicts with conditional prediction probabilities that differ from the closest common baseline. We provide new local-optimization methods for estimating the multiclass DCPunder two different regimes,one in which the conditional confusion matrices for each protected sub-population are known, and one in which these cannot be estimated, for instance, because the classifier is inaccessible or because good-quality individual-level data is not available. These methods can be used to detect classifiers that likely treat a significant fraction of the population unfairly. Experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the methods. Code is provided at https://github.com/sivansabato/ DCPmulticlass.

Abstract: Diffusion models are a state-of-the-art generative modeling framework that transform noise to images via Langevin sampling, guided by the score, which is the gradient of the logarithm of the data distribution. Recent works have shown empirically that the generation quality can be improved when guided by classifier network, which is typically the discriminator trained in a generative adversarial network (GAN) setting. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of the GAN discriminator on Langevin-based sampling, and show that the IPM-GAN optimization can be seen as one of smoothed score-matching, wherein the scores of the data and the generator distributions are convolved with the kernel function associated with the IPM. The proposed approach serves to unify score-based training and optimization of IPM-GANs. Based on these insights, we demonstrate that closed-form kernel-based discriminator guidance, results in improvements (in terms of CLIP-FID and KID metrics) when applied atop baseline diffusion models. We demonstrate these results on the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) and latent diffusion model (LDM) settings on various standard datasets. We also show that the proposed approach can be combined with existing accelerated-diffusion techniques to improve latent-space image generation.

Abstract: Quantization is a fundamental optimization for many machine-learning use cases, including compressing gradients, model weights and activations, and datasets. The most accurate form of quantization is \emph{adaptive}, where the error is minimized with respect to a given input, rather than optimizing for the worst case. However, optimal adaptive quantization methods are considered infeasible in terms of both their runtime and memory requirements.
  We revisit the Adaptive Vector Quantization (AVQ) problem and present algorithms that find optimal solutions with asymptotically improved time and space complexity. We also present an even faster near-optimal algorithm for large inputs. Our experiments show our algorithms may open the door to using AVQ more extensively in a variety of machine learning applications.

Abstract: Message passing neural networks have demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting molecular interactions. Introducing equivariant vectorial representations augments expressivity by capturing geometric data symmetries, thereby improving model accuracy. However, two-body bond vectors in opposition may cancel each other out during message passing, leading to the loss of directional information on their shared node. In this study, we develop Equivariant N-body Interaction Networks (ENINet) that explicitly integrates l = 1 equivariant many-body interactions to enhance directional symmetric information in the message passing scheme. We provided a mathematical analysis demonstrating the necessity of incorporating many-body equivariant interactions and generalized the formulation to $N$-body interactions. Experiments indicate that integrating many-body equivariant representations enhances prediction accuracy across diverse scalar and tensorial quantum chemical properties.

Abstract: Detecting and quantifying causality is a focal topic in the fields of science, engineering, and interdisciplinary studies. However, causal studies on non-intervention systems attract much attention but remain extremely challenging. Delay-embedding technique provides a promising approach. In this study, we propose a framework named Interventional Dynamical Causality (IntDC) in contrast to the traditional Constructive Dynamical Causality (ConDC). ConDC, including Granger causality, transfer entropy and convergence of cross-mapping, measures the causality by constructing a dynamical model without considering interventions. A computational criterion, Interventional Embedding Entropy (IEE), is proposed to measure causal strengths in an interventional manner. IEE is an intervened causal information flow but in the delay-embedding space. Further, the IEE theoretically and numerically enables the deciphering of IntDC solely from observational (non-interventional) time-series data, without requiring any knowledge of dynamical models or real interventions in the considered system. In particular, IEE can be applied to rank causal effects according to their importance and construct causal networks from data. We conducted numerical experiments to demonstrate that IEE can find causal edges accurately, eliminate effects of confounding, and quantify causal strength robustly over traditional indices. We also applied IEE to real-world tasks. IEE performed as an accurate and robust tool for causal analyses solely from the observational data. The IntDC framework and IEE algorithm provide an efficient approach to the study of causality from time series in diverse non-intervention complex systems.

Abstract: While synthetic tabular data generation using Deep Generative Models (DGMs) offers a compelling solution to data scarcity and privacy concerns, their effectiveness relies on the availability of substantial training data, often lacking in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel methodology that explicitly integrates artificial inductive biases into the generative process to improve data quality in low-data regimes. Our framework leverages transfer learning and meta-learning techniques to construct and inject informative inductive biases into DGMs. We evaluate four approaches (pre-training, model averaging, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), and Domain Randomized Search (DRS)) and analyze their impact on the quality of the generated text. Experimental results show that incorporating inductive bias substantially improves performance, with transfer learning methods outperforming meta-learning, achieving up to 60\% gains in Jensen-Shannon divergence. The methodology is model-agnostic and especially relevant in domains such as healthcare and finance, where high-quality synthetic data are essential, and data availability is often limited.

Abstract: Distributed deep learning in resource-constrained environments faces scalability and generalization challenges due to large effective batch sizes and non-identically distributed client data. We introduce a server-driven sampling strategy that maintains a fixed global batch size by dynamically adjusting client-side batch sizes. This decouples the effective batch size from the number of participating devices and ensures that global batches better reflect the overall data distribution. Using standard concentration bounds, we establish tighter deviation guarantees compared to existing approaches. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method improves model accuracy, training efficiency, and convergence stability, offering a scalable solution for learning at the network edge.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems is crucial for various applications such as climate modeling. However, achieving such predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems, which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid and then correcting its errors through a \textit{closure model}, which approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a 330x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\sim 10\%$. In contrast, the closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $60$x slower than PINO while having a much higher error $\sim186\%$ when the closure model is trained on the same FRS dataset.

Abstract: We look at a problem related to Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, on quantifying the approximation error between a true stationary process $X_t$ and an ARMA model $Y_t$. We take the transfer function representation $x(L)$ of a stationary process $X_t$ and show that the $L^{\infty}$ norm of $x$ acts as a valid norm on $X_t$ that controls the $\ell^2$ norm of its Wold coefficients. We then show that a certain subspace of stationary processes, which includes ARMA models, forms a Banach algebra under the $L^{\infty}$ norm that respects the multiplicative structure of $H^{\infty}$ transfer functions and thus improves on the structural properties of the cepstral norm for ARMA models. The natural definition of invertibility in this algebra is consistent with the original definition of ARMA invertibility, and generalizes better to non-ARMA processes than Wiener's $\ell^1$ condition. Finally, we calculate some explicit approximation bounds in the simpler context of continuous transfer functions, and critique some heuristic ideas on Pad\'e approximations and parsimonious models.

Abstract: When quantizing weights and activations to increasingly narrower representations, the cost of additions begins to dominate that of multiplications in multiply-accumulate (MAC) units. Recent studies show that reducing addition costs via low-precision accumulation improves throughput, power, and area across inference platforms, albeit with an increased risk of overflow. Accumulator-aware quantization research has so far only considered the quantization-aware training (QAT) paradigm, in which models are fine-tuned or trained from scratch with quantization in the loop. As models and datasets continue to grow in size, QAT techniques become increasingly more expensive, which has motivated the recent surge in post-training quantization (PTQ) research. To bridge this gap, we introduce AXE, the first accumulator-aware quantization framework explicitly designed to endow overflow avoidance guarantees to PTQ algorithms. We present theoretical motivation for AXE and demonstrate its flexibility by implementing it on top of two existing algorithms: GPFQ and OPTQ. We design AXE to support multi-stage accumulation, opening the door to full datapath optimization for the first time. We evaluate AXE using recent language generation models; when quantizing Llama3 8B for a 16-bit multi-stage accumulation datapath, AXE maintains up to 98% of the FP16 perplexity, surpassing naive bit width manipulation by up to 15%.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is ubiquitous in the development of modern AI systems. However, state-of-the-art RL agents require extensive, and potentially unsafe, interactions with their environments to learn effectively. These limitations confine RL agents to simulated environments, hindering their ability to learn directly in real-world settings. In this work, we present ActSafe, a novel model-based RL algorithm for safe and efficient exploration. ActSafe learns a well-calibrated probabilistic model of the system and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics, while enforcing pessimism w.r.t. the safety constraints. Under regularity assumptions on the constraints and dynamics, we show that ActSafe guarantees safety during learning while also obtaining a near-optimal policy in finite time. In addition, we propose a practical variant of ActSafe that builds on latest model-based RL advancements and enables safe exploration even in high-dimensional settings such as visual control. We empirically show that ActSafe obtains state-of-the-art performance in difficult exploration tasks on standard safe deep RL benchmarks while ensuring safety during learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a new hybrid model for predicting German electricity prices. The algorithm is based on a combination of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Although GPR is a competent model for learning stochastic patterns within data and for interpolation, its performance for out-of-sample data is not very promising. By choosing a suitable data-dependent covariance function, we can enhance the performance of GPR for the German hourly power prices being tested. However, since the out-of-sample prediction is dependent on the training data, the prediction is vulnerable to noise and outliers. To overcome this issue, a separate prediction is calculated using SVR, which applies margin-based optimization. This method is advantageous when dealing with non-linear processes and outliers, since only certain necessary points (support vectors) in the training data are responsible for regression. The individual predictions are then linearly combined using uniform weights. When tested on historic German power prices, this approach outperforms the publicly available benchmarks, namely the LASSO estimated autoregressive regression model, deep neural network provided in the recent research by [1].

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms aim to balance exploiting the current best strategy with exploring new options that could lead to higher rewards. Most common RL algorithms use undirected exploration, i.e., select random sequences of actions. Exploration can also be directed using intrinsic rewards, such as curiosity or model epistemic uncertainty. However, effectively balancing task and intrinsic rewards is challenging and often task-dependent. In this work, we introduce a framework, MaxInfoRL, for balancing intrinsic and extrinsic exploration. MaxInfoRL steers exploration towards informative transitions, by maximizing intrinsic rewards such as the information gain about the underlying task. When combined with Boltzmann exploration, this approach naturally trades off maximization of the value function with that of the entropy over states, rewards, and actions. We show that our approach achieves sublinear regret in the simplified setting of multi-armed bandits. We then apply this general formulation to a variety of off-policy model-free RL methods for continuous state-action spaces, yielding novel algorithms that achieve superior performance across hard exploration problems and complex scenarios such as visual control tasks.

Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of text-to-image models has become an increasingly popular technique with many applications. Among the various PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant attention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with limited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the pre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in subject-driven and controllable generation. The results manifest that our method can achieve better performances and parameter efficiency compared to LoRA and several baselines.

This paper explores the integration of LLMs into energy management, emphasizing their roles in automating the optimization of DSM strategies with Internet of electric vehicles. We investigate challenges and solutions associated with DSM and explore the new opportunities presented by leveraging LLMs. Then, we propose an innovative solution that enhances LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation for automatic problem formulation, code generation, and customizing optimization. We present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in charging scheduling and optimization for electric vehicles, highlighting our solution's significant advancements in energy efficiency and user adaptability. This work underscores the potential of LLMs for energy optimization and fosters a new era of intelligent DSM solutions.

Abstract: Machine learning models can effectively forecast dynamical systems from time-series data, but they typically require large amounts of past data, making forecasting particularly challenging for systems with limited history. To overcome this, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting using Related Time Series (METAFORS), which generalizes knowledge across systems to enable forecasting in data-limited scenarios. By learning from a library of models trained on longer time series from potentially related systems, METAFORS builds and initializes a model tailored to short time-series data from the system of interest. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate that METAFORS can reliably predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics without requiring contextual labels. We see this even when test and related systems exhibit substantially different behaviors, highlighting METAFORS' strengths in data-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, despite their remarkable success, remain fundamentally limited in their ability to perform Continual Learning (CL). While most current methods aim to enhance the capabilities of a single model, Inspired by the collective learning mechanisms of human populations, we introduce Evolving Continual Learning (ECL), a framework that maintains and evolves a diverse population of neural network models. ECL continually searches for an optimal architecture for each introduced incremental task. This tailored model is trained on the corresponding task and archived as a specialized expert, contributing to a growing collection of skills. This approach inherently resolves the core CL challenges: stability is achieved through the isolation of expert models, while plasticity is greatly enhanced by evolving unique, task-specific architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that ECL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art individual-level CL methods. By shifting the focus from individual adaptation to collective evolution, ECL presents a novel path toward AI systems capable of CL.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing prediction sets with coverage guarantees. Classical methods, such as split conformal prediction, provide marginal coverage, ensuring that the prediction set contains the label of a random test point with a target probability. However, these guarantees may not hold uniformly across different subpopulations, leading to disparities in coverage. Prior work has explored coverage guarantees conditioned on events related to the covariates and label of the test point. We present Kandinsky conformal prediction, a framework that significantly expands the scope of conditional coverage guarantees. In contrast to Mondrian conformal prediction, which restricts its coverage guarantees to disjoint groups -- reminiscent of the rigid, structured grids of Piet Mondrian's art -- our framework flexibly handles overlapping and fractional group memberships defined jointly on covariates and labels, reflecting the layered, intersecting forms in Wassily Kandinsky's compositions. Our algorithm unifies and extends existing methods, encompassing covariate-based group conditional, class conditional, and Mondrian conformal prediction as special cases, while achieving a minimax-optimal high-probability conditional coverage bound. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach through empirical evaluation on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites have promoted the application of large remote sensing foundation models for various downstream tasks. However, direct downloading of these models for fine-tuning on the ground is impeded by privacy concerns and limited bandwidth. Satellite federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling model fine-tuning directly on-board satellites and aggregating model updates without data downloading. Nevertheless, for large foundation models, the computational capacity of satellites is insufficient to support effective on-board fine-tuning in traditional satellite FL frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose a satellite-ground collaborative federated fine-tuning framework. The key of the framework lies in how to reasonably decompose and allocate model components to alleviate insufficient on-board computation capabilities. During fine-tuning, satellites exchange intermediate results with ground stations or other satellites for forward propagation and back propagation, which brings communication challenges due to the special communication topology of space transmission networks, such as intermittent satellite-ground communication, short duration of satellite-ground communication windows, and unstable inter-orbit inter-satellite links (ISLs). To reduce transmission delays, we further introduce tailored communication strategies that integrate both communication and computing resources. Specifically, we propose a parallel intra-orbit communication strategy, a topology-aware satellite-ground communication strategy, and a latency-minimalization inter-orbit communication strategy to reduce space communication costs. Simulation results demonstrate significant reductions in training time with improvements of approximately 33%.

Abstract: Speech and voice conditions can alter the acoustic properties of speech, which could impact the performance of paralinguistic models for affect for people with atypical speech. We evaluate publicly available models for recognizing categorical and dimensional affect from speech on a dataset of atypical speech, comparing results to datasets of typical speech. We investigate three dimensions of speech atypicality: intelligibility, which is related to pronounciation; monopitch, which is related to prosody, and harshness, which is related to voice quality. We look at (1) distributional trends of categorical affect predictions within the dataset, (2) distributional comparisons of categorical affect predictions to similar datasets of typical speech, and (3) correlation strengths between text and speech predictions for spontaneous speech for valence and arousal. We find that the output of affect models is significantly impacted by the presence and degree of speech atypicalities. For instance, the percentage of speech predicted as sad is significantly higher for all types and grades of atypical speech when compared to similar typical speech datasets. In a preliminary investigation on improving robustness for atypical speech, we find that fine-tuning models on pseudo-labeled atypical speech data improves performance on atypical speech without impacting performance on typical speech. Our results emphasize the need for broader training and evaluation datasets for speech emotion models, and for modeling approaches that are robust to voice and speech differences.

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning research is commonly framed in the context of classification tasks, leaving critical gaps in regression. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measure intersectional fairness in regression tasks, going beyond the focus on single protected attributes from existing work to consider combinations of all protected attributes. Furthermore, we contend that it is insufficient to measure the average error of groups without regard for imbalanced domain preferences. Accordingly, we propose Intersectional Divergence (ID) as the first fairness measure for regression tasks that 1) describes fair model behavior across multiple protected attributes and 2) differentiates the impact of predictions in target ranges most relevant to users. We extend our proposal demonstrating how ID can be adapted into a loss function, IDLoss, that satisfies convergence guarantees and has piecewise smooth properties that enable practical optimization. Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate how ID allows unique insights into model behavior and fairness, and how incorporating IDLoss into optimization can considerably improve single-attribute and intersectional model fairness while maintaining a competitive balance in predictive performance.

Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial sets derived directly from hypergraphs, called symmetric simplicial lifting, which encode all possible oriented subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our symmetric simplicial lifting reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of neural sheaf diffusion to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian over symmetric simplicial lifting, resolving orientation ambiguity and adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate HNSDs competitive performance across established benchmarks.

Abstract: Wave-like images-from attosecond streaking spectrograms to optical spectra, audio mel-spectrograms and periodic video frames-encode critical harmonic structures that elude conventional feature extractors. We propose a unified, matrix-equivalent framework that reinterprets convolution and attention as linear transforms on flattened inputs, revealing filter weights as basis vectors spanning latent feature subspaces. To infuse spectral priors we apply elementwise $\sin(\cdot)$ mappings to each weight matrix. Embedding these transforms into CNN, ViT and Capsule architectures yields Sin-Basis Networks with heightened sensitivity to periodic motifs and built-in invariance to spatial shifts. Experiments on a diverse collection of wave-like image datasets-including 80,000 synthetic attosecond streaking spectrograms, thousands of Raman, photoluminescence and FTIR spectra, mel-spectrograms from AudioSet and cycle-pattern frames from Kinetics-demonstrate substantial gains in reconstruction accuracy, translational robustness and zero-shot cross-domain transfer. Theoretical analysis via matrix isomorphism and Mercer-kernel truncation quantifies how sinusoidal reparametrization enriches expressivity while preserving stability in data-scarce regimes. Sin-Basis Networks thus offer a lightweight, physics-informed approach to deep learning across all wave-form imaging modalities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents can achieve super-human performance in complex decision-making tasks, but their behaviour is often difficult to understand and explain. This lack of explanation limits deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where understanding and trust are essential. We identify three core explanatory targets that together provide a comprehensive view of reinforcement learning agents: behaviour, outcomes, and predictions. We develop a unified theoretical framework for explaining these three elements of reinforcement learning agents through the influence of individual features that the agent observes in its environment. We derive feature influences by using Shapley values, which collectively and uniquely satisfy a set of well-motivated axioms for fair and consistent credit assignment. The proposed approach, Shapley Values for Explaining Reinforcement Learning (SVERL), provides a single theoretical framework to comprehensively and meaningfully explain reinforcement learning agents. It yields explanations with precise semantics that are not only interpretable but also mathematically justified, enabling us to identify and correct conceptual issues in prior explanations. Through illustrative examples, we show how SVERL produces useful, intuitive explanations of agent behaviour, outcomes, and predictions, which are not apparent from observing agent behaviour alone.

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.

<title>A ZeNN architecture to avoid the Gaussian trap</title>

Abstract: We propose a new simple architecture, Zeta Neural Networks (ZeNNs), in order to overcome several shortcomings of standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Namely, in the large width limit, MLPs are non-parametric, they do not have a well-defined pointwise limit, they lose non-Gaussian attributes and become unable to perform feature learning; moreover, finite width MLPs perform poorly in learning high frequencies. The new ZeNN architecture is inspired by three simple principles from harmonic analysis:
  i) Enumerate the perceptons and introduce a non-learnable weight to enforce convergence;
  ii) Introduce a scaling (or frequency) factor;
  iii) Choose activation functions that lead to near orthogonal systems.
  We will show that these ideas allow us to fix the referred shortcomings of MLPs. In fact, in the infinite width limit, ZeNNs converge pointwise, they exhibit a rich asymptotic structure beyond Gaussianity, and perform feature learning. Moreover, when appropriate activation functions are chosen, (finite width) ZeNNs excel at learning high-frequency features of functions with low dimensional domains.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge (stability). Although pre-trained models (PTMs) have provided a strong foundation for CL, existing approaches face a fundamental challenge in balancing these two competing objectives. Current methods typically address stability by freezing the PTM backbone, which severely limits the model's plasticity, particularly when incoming data distribution diverges largely from the pre-training data. Alternatively, sequentially fine-tuning the entire PTM can adapt to new knowledge but often leads to catastrophic forgetting, highlighting the critical stability-plasticity trade-off in PTM-based CL. To address this limitation, we propose Adapting PTMs before the core CL} process (ACL), a novel framework that introduces a plug-and-play adaptation phase prior to learning each new task. During this phase, ACL refines the PTM backbone by aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them from irrelevant classes. This mechanism theoretically and empirically demonstrates desirable balance between stability and plasticity, significantly improving CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods. Code is available at https://github.com/byyx666/ACL_code.

Abstract: A key challenge for the machine learning community is to understand and accelerate the training dynamics of deep networks that lead to delayed generalisation and emergent robustness to input perturbations, also known as grokking. Prior work has associated phenomena like delayed generalisation with the transition of a deep network from a linear to a feature learning regime, and emergent robustness with changes to the network's functional geometry, in particular the arrangement of the so-called linear regions in deep networks employing continuous piecewise affine nonlinearities. Here, we explain how grokking is realised in the Jacobian of a deep network and demonstrate that aligning a network's Jacobians with the training data (in the sense of cosine similarity) ensures grokking under a low-rank Jacobian assumption. Our results provide a strong theoretical motivation for the use of Jacobian regularisation in optimizing deep networks -- a method we introduce as GrokAlign -- which we show empirically to induce grokking much sooner than more conventional regularizers like weight decay. Moreover, we introduce centroid alignment as a tractable and interpretable simplification of Jacobian alignment that effectively identifies and tracks the stages of deep network training dynamics.

Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) for machine learning engineering (MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these, we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 64% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench Lite, significantly outperforming the best alternative.

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and (ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS) within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of (53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx 0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the "revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In particular, these peaks occur at depths $\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m \approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

Abstract: We propose TPP-SD, a novel approach that accelerates Transformer temporal point process (TPP) sampling by adapting speculative decoding (SD) techniques from language models. By identifying the structural similarities between thinning algorithms for TPPs and speculative decoding for language models, we develop an efficient sampling framework that leverages a smaller draft model to generate multiple candidate events, which are then verified by the larger target model in parallel. TPP-SD maintains the same output distribution as autoregressive sampling while achieving significant acceleration. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach produces samples from identical distributions as standard methods, but with 2-6$\times$ speedup. Our ablation studies analyze the impact of hyperparameters such as draft length and draft model size on sampling efficiency. TPP-SD bridges the gap between powerful Transformer TPP models and the practical need for rapid sequence sampling.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space. However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore, the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design, demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for model design.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of objects in visual perception in the absence of any semantic annotation. The resulting model has received no supervision, does not use any pre-trained features, and yet it can segment the domain of an image into multiple independently moving regions. The resulting motion segmentation method can handle an unknown and varying number of objects in real-time. The core multi-modal conditional encoder-decoder architecture has one modality (optical flow) feed the encoder to produce a collection of latent codes (slots), and the other modality (color image) conditions the decoder to generate the first modality (flow) from the slots. The training criterion is designed to foster 'information separation' among the slots, while the architecture explicitly allocates activations to individual slots, leading to a method we call Divided Attention (DivA). At test time, DivA handles a different number of objects and different image resolution than seen at training, and is invariant to permutations of the slots. DivA achieves state-of-the-art performance while tripling the runtime speed of comparable methods, up to 104 FPS, and reduces the performance gap from supervised methods to 12% or less. Objects bootstrapped by DivA can then be used to prime static classifiers via contrastive learning. On fewer than 5,000 video clips, training DINO on DivA's object proposals narrows the performance gap to ImageNet-based training by up to 30.2% compared to training directly on the video frames.

Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a function from $L^2$ by an element of a given $m$-dimensional space $V_m$, associated with some feature map $\boldsymbol{\varphi}$, using evaluations of the function at random points $x_1, \dots,x_n$. After recalling some results on optimal weighted least-squares using independent and identically distributed points, we consider weighted least-squares using projection determinantal point processes (DPP) or volume sampling. These distributions introduce dependence between the points that promotes diversity in the selected features $\boldsymbol{\varphi}(x_i)$. We first provide a generalized version of volume-rescaled sampling yielding quasi-optimality results in expectation with a number of samples $n = O(m\log(m))$, that means that the expected $L^2$ error is bounded by a constant times the best approximation error in $L^2$. Also, further assuming that the function is in some normed vector space $H$ continuously embedded in $L^2$, we further prove that the approximation error in $L^2$ is almost surely bounded by the best approximation error measured in the $H$-norm. This includes the cases of functions from $L^\infty$ or reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we present an alternative strategy consisting in using independent repetitions of projection DPP (or volume sampling), yielding similar error bounds as with i.i.d. or volume sampling, but in practice with a much lower number of samples. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the different strategies.

Abstract: Polyak's Heavy Ball (PHB; Polyak, 1964), a.k.a. Classical Momentum, and Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG; Nesterov, 1983) are well-established momentum-descent methods for optimization. Although the latter generally outperforms the former, primarily, generalizations of PHB-like methods to nonlinear spaces have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. In this paper, we propose a generalization of NAG-like methods for Lie group optimization. This generalization is based on the variational one-to-one correspondence between classical and accelerated momentum methods (Campos et al., 2023). We provide numerical experiments for chosen retractions on the group of rotations based on the Frobenius norm and the Rosenbrock function to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and that align with results of the Euclidean case, that is, a faster convergence rate for NAG.

Abstract: Mirroring the complex structures and diverse functions of natural organisms is a long-standing challenge in robotics. Modern fabrication techniques have greatly expanded the feasible hardware, but using these systems requires control software to translate the desired motions into actuator commands. Conventional robots can easily be modeled as rigid links connected by joints, but it remains an open challenge to model and control biologically inspired robots that are often soft or made of several materials, lack sensing capabilities, and may change their material properties with use. Here, we introduce a method that uses deep neural networks to map a video stream of a robot to its visuomotor Jacobian field (the sensitivity of all 3D points to the robot's actuators). Our method enables the control of robots from only a single camera, makes no assumptions about the robots' materials, actuation, or sensing, and is trained without expert intervention by observing the execution of random commands. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of robot manipulators that vary in actuation, materials, fabrication, and cost. Our approach achieves accurate closed-loop control and recovers the causal dynamic structure of each robot. Because it enables robot control using a generic camera as the only sensor, we anticipate that our work will broaden the design space of robotic systems and serve as a starting point for lowering the barrier to robotic automation.

Abstract: Explainability in artificial intelligence (XAI) remains a crucial aspect for fostering trust and understanding in machine learning models. Current visual explanation techniques, such as gradient-based or class-activation-based methods, often exhibit a strong dependence on specific model architectures. Conversely, perturbation-based methods, despite being model-agnostic, are computationally expensive as they require evaluating models on a large number of forward passes. In this work, we introduce Foveation-based Explanations (FovEx), a novel XAI method inspired by human vision. FovEx seamlessly integrates biologically inspired perturbations by iteratively creating foveated renderings of the image and combines them with gradient-based visual explorations to determine locations of interest efficiently. These locations are selected to maximize the performance of the model to be explained with respect to the downstream task and then combined to generate an attribution map. We provide a thorough evaluation with qualitative and quantitative assessments on established benchmarks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both transformers (on 4 out of 5 metrics) and convolutional models (on 3 out of 5 metrics), demonstrating its versatility among various architectures. Furthermore, we show the alignment between the explanation map produced by FovEx and human gaze patterns (+14\% in NSS compared to RISE, +203\% in NSS compared to GradCAM). This comparison enhances our confidence in FovEx's ability to close the interpretation gap between humans and machines.

Abstract: We implement a hybrid quantum-classical model for image classification that compresses MNIST digit images into a low-dimensional feature space and then maps these features onto a 5-qubit quantum state. First, an autoencoder compresses each $28\times28$ image (784 pixels) into a 64-dimensional latent vector, preserving salient features of the digit with minimal reconstruction error. We further reduce the latent representation to 5 principal components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to match the 5 available qubits. These 5 features are encoded as rotation angles in a quantum circuit with 5 qubits. The quantum feature map applies single-qubit rotations ($R_y$ gates) proportional to the feature values, followed by a Hadamard gate and a cascade of entangling CNOT gates to produce a non-product entangled state. Measuring the 5-qubit state yields a 32-dimensional probability distribution over basis outcomes, which serves as a quantum-enhanced feature vector for classification. A classical neural network with a softmax output is then trained on these 32-dimensional quantum feature vectors to predict the digit class. We evaluate the hybrid model on the MNIST dataset and compare it to a purely classical baseline that uses the 64-dimensional autoencoder latent features for classification. The results show that the hybrid model can successfully classify digits, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating quantum computing in the classification pipeline, although its accuracy (about 75\% on test data) currently falls below the classical baseline (about 98\% on the same compressed data).

Our approach formulates a learning problem, which enables fast analytical evaluation of integrals over subspaces that appear in the calculation of the ANOVA decomposition. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to provide insights into the approximation properties compared to other regression approaches from the literature.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds unparalleled potentials to enhance machine learning. However, a demonstration of quantum learning advantage has not been achieved so far. We make a step forward by rigorously establishing a noise-robust, unconditional quantum learning advantage in expressivity, inference speed, and training efficiency, compared to commonly-used classical models. Our proof is information-theoretic and pinpoints the origin of this advantage: entanglement can be used to reduce the communication required by non-local tasks. In particular, we design a task that can be solved with certainty by quantum models with a constant number of parameters using entanglement, whereas commonly-used classical models must scale linearly to achieve a larger-than-exponentially-small accuracy. We show that the quantum model is trainable with constant resources and robust against constant noise. Through numerical and trapped-ion experiments on IonQ Aria, we demonstrate the desired advantage. Our results provide valuable guidance for demonstrating quantum learning advantages with current noisy intermediate-scale devices.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.

Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm for controlling linear time invariant systems in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process. We show theoretically that our controller satisfies open-loop stability for the optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave approximants are essential for gravitational-wave astronomy, allowing the coverage binary black hole parameter space for inference or match filtering without costly numerical relativity (NR) simulations, but generally trading some accuracy for computational efficiency. To reduce this trade-off, NR surrogate models can be constructed using interpolation within NR waveform space. We present a 2-stage training approach for neural network-based NR surrogate models. Initially trained on approximant-generated waveforms and then fine-tuned with NR data, these dual-stage artificial neural surrogate (\texttt{DANSur}) models offer rapid and competitively accurate waveform generation, generating millions in under 20ms on a GPU while keeping mean mismatches with NR around $10^{-4}$. Implemented in the \textsc{bilby} framework, we show they can be used for parameter estimation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of language models, particularly in code generation, requires substantial computational resources, raising concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. Optimizing language models inference resource utilization is crucial, and Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising solution to reduce resource demands. Our goal is to analyze the impact of deep learning serving configurations, defined as combinations of runtime engines and execution providers, on resource utilization, in terms of energy consumption, execution time, and computing-resource utilization from the point of view of software engineers conducting inference in the context of code generation SLMs. We conducted a technology-oriented, multi-stage experimental pipeline using twelve code generation SLMs to investigate energy consumption, execution time, and computing-resource utilization across the configurations. Significant differences emerged across configurations. CUDA execution provider configurations outperformed CPU execution provider configurations in both energy consumption and execution time. Among the configurations, TORCH paired with CUDA demonstrated the greatest energy efficiency, achieving energy savings from 37.99% up to 89.16% compared to other serving configurations. Similarly, optimized runtime engines like ONNX with the CPU execution provider achieved from 8.98% up to 72.04% energy savings within CPU-based configurations. Also, TORCH paired with CUDA exhibited efficient computing-resource utilization. Serving configuration choice significantly impacts resource utilization. While further research is needed, we recommend the above configurations best suited to software engineers' requirements for enhancing serving resource utilization efficiency.

<title>Tensor Product Neural Networks for Functional ANOVA Model</title>

Abstract: Interpretability for machine learning models is becoming more and more important as machine learning models become more complex. The functional ANOVA model, which decomposes a high-dimensional function into a sum of lower dimensional functions (commonly referred to as components), is one of the most popular tools for interpretable AI, and recently, various neural networks have been developed for estimating each component in the functional ANOVA model. However, such neural networks are highly unstable when estimating each component since the components themselves are not uniquely defined. That is, there are multiple functional ANOVA decompositions for a given function. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network which guarantees a unique functional ANOVA decomposition and thus is able to estimate each component stably and accurately. We call our proposed neural network ANOVA Tensor Product Neural Network (ANOVA-TPNN) since it is motivated by the tensor product basis expansion. Theoretically, we prove that ANOVA-TPNN can approximate any smooth function well. Empirically, we show that ANOVA-TPNN provide much more stable estimation of each component and thus much more stable interpretation when training data and initial values of the model parameters vary than existing neural networks do.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable neural interaction by decoding brain activity for external communication. Motor imagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive mechanism. However, most existing models rely on single-stream architectures and overlook the multi-view nature of EEG signals, leading to limited performance and generalization. We propose a multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet), a dual-branch architecture that parallelly integrates CNN and Transformer blocks to capture both local spatial-temporal features and global temporal dependencies. To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet incorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view contrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views, and a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both branches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive and classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three scenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms nine state-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by integrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to the development of more reliable BCI systems.

Abstract: Understanding the principles of protein folding is a cornerstone of computational biology, with implications for drug design, bioengineering, and the understanding of fundamental biological processes. Lattice protein folding models offer a simplified yet powerful framework for studying the complexities of protein folding, enabling the exploration of energetically optimal folds under constrained conditions. However, finding these optimal folds is a computationally challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we introduce a novel upper-bound training scheme that employs masking to identify the lowest-energy folds in two-dimensional Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) lattice protein folding. By leveraging Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with an annealing process driven by temperature-like fluctuations, our method accurately predicts optimal folds for benchmark systems of up to 60 beads. Our approach also effectively masks invalid folds from being sampled without compromising the autoregressive sampling properties of RNNs. This scheme is generalizable to three spatial dimensions and can be extended to lattice protein models with larger alphabets. Our findings emphasize the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in tackling complex protein folding problems and a broader class of constrained combinatorial optimization challenges.

<title>Learning 3D Scene Analogies with Neural Contextual Scene Maps</title>

Abstract: Understanding scene contexts is crucial for machines to perform tasks and adapt prior knowledge in unseen or noisy 3D environments. As data-driven learning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of layouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational commonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise representations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between 3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single instance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions, potentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long demonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object rearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene maps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric contexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map estimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making it robust to input noise or shape variations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying scene analogies and transferring trajectories or object placements in diverse indoor scenes, indicating its potential for robotics and AR/VR applications.

<title>ModalTune: Fine-Tuning Slide-Level Foundation Models with Multi-Modal Information for Multi-task Learning in Digital Pathology</title>

Abstract: Prediction tasks in digital pathology are challenging due to the massive size of whole-slide images (WSIs) and the weak nature of training signals. Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.

arXiv:2504.05422v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the prediction horizon increases, predicting the future evolution of traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach. The code and model checkpoints are available at: https://github.com/continental/EP-Diffuser.

Abstract: An ideal detection system for machine generated content is supposed to work well on any generator as many more advanced LLMs come into existence day by day. Existing systems often struggle with accurately identifying AI-generated content over shorter texts. Further, not all texts might be entirely authored by a human or LLM, hence we focused more over partial cases i.e human-LLM co-authored texts. Our paper introduces a set of models built for the task of token classification which are trained on an extensive collection of human-machine co-authored texts, which performed well over texts of unseen domains, unseen generators, texts by non-native speakers and those with adversarial inputs. We also introduce a new dataset of over 2.4M such texts mostly co-authored by several popular proprietary LLMs over 23 languages. We also present findings of our models' performance over each texts of each domain and generator. Additional findings include comparison of performance against each adversarial method, length of input texts and characteristics of generated texts compared to the original human authored texts.

<title>CEE: An Inference-Time Jailbreak Defense for Embodied Intelligence via Subspace Concept Rotation</title>

arXiv:2504.13201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming the cognitive core of Embodied Intelligence (EI) systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. However, this integration also exposes them to serious jailbreak risks, where malicious instructions can be transformed into dangerous physical actions. Existing defense mechanisms suffer from notable drawbacks--including high training costs, significant inference delays, and complex hyperparameter tuning--which limit their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel and efficient inference-time defense framework: Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE). CEE enhances the model's inherent safety mechanisms by directly manipulating its internal representations, requiring neither additional training nor external modules, thereby improving defense efficiency. Furthermore, CEE introduces a rotation-based control mechanism that enables stable and linearly tunable behavioral control of the model. This design eliminates the need for tedious manual tuning and avoids the output degradation issues commonly observed in other representation engineering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple EI safety benchmarks and diverse attack scenarios demonstrate that CEE significantly improves the defense success rates of various multimodal LLMs. It effectively mitigates safety risks while preserving high-quality generation and inference efficiency, offering a promising solution for deploying safer embodied intelligence systems.

Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectra of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We approach this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.

<title>Where Paths Collide: A Comprehensive Survey of Classic and Learning-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</title>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics, requiring the computation of collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating from their start locations to designated goals. As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in warehouses, urban transportation, and other complex environments, MAPF has evolved from a theoretical challenge to a critical enabler of real-world multi-robot coordination. This comprehensive survey bridges the long-standing divide between classical algorithmic approaches and emerging learning-based methods in MAPF research. We present a unified framework that encompasses search-based methods (including Conflict-Based Search, Priority-Based Search, and Large Neighborhood Search), compilation-based approaches (SAT, SMT, CSP, ASP, and MIP formulations), and data-driven techniques (reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and hybrid strategies). Through systematic analysis of experimental practices across 200+ papers, we uncover significant disparities in evaluation methodologies, with classical methods typically tested on larger-scale instances (up to 200 by 200 grids with 1000+ agents) compared to learning-based approaches (predominantly 10-100 agents). We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation metrics, environment types, and baseline selections, highlighting the need for standardized benchmarking protocols. Finally, we outline promising future directions including mixed-motive MAPF with game-theoretic considerations, language-grounded planning with large language models, and neural solver architectures that combine the rigor of classical methods with the flexibility of deep learning. This survey serves as both a comprehensive reference for researchers and a practical guide for deploying MAPF solutions in increasingly complex real-world applications.

<title>Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks</title>

Abstract: Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively. Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social), and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and (iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model, TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering improved interpretability through its structured output.

arXiv:2505.21567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of Embodied Artificial intelligence, the end-to-end control policy such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has become the mainstream. Existing VLA models faces expensive computing/storage cost, which need to be optimized. Quantization is considered as the most effective method which can not only reduce the memory cost but also achieve computation acceleration. However, we find the token alignment of VLA models hinders the application of existing quantization methods. To address this, we proposed an optimized framework called EaqVLA, which apply encoding-aligned quantization to VLA models. Specifically, we propose an complete analysis method to find the misalignment in various granularity. Based on the analysis results, we propose a mixed precision quantization with the awareness of encoding alignment. Experiments shows that the porposed EaqVLA achieves better quantization performance (with the minimal quantization loss for end-to-end action control and xxx times acceleration) than existing quantization methods.

Abstract: In breast cancer HER2 assessment, clinical evaluation relies on combined H&amp;E and IHC images, yet acquiring both modalities is often hindered by clinical constraints and cost. We propose an adaptive bimodal prediction framework that flexibly supports single- or dual-modality inputs through two core innovations: a dynamic branch selector activating modality completion or joint inference based on input availability, and a cross-modal GAN (CM-GAN) enabling feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities. This design dramatically improves H&amp;E-only accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25%, achieves 95.09% with full dual-modality inputs, and maintains 90.28% reliability under single-modality conditions. The "dual-modality preferred, single-modality compatible" architecture delivers near-dual-modality accuracy without mandatory synchronized acquisition, offering a cost-effective solution for resource-limited regions and significantly improving HER2 assessment accessibility.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges. Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise in quality.

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input (e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods. Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in autonomous driving refer to situations that deviate from the training domain, often leading to unexpected and potentially hazardous behavior from planners that lack prior exposure to such cases. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been introduced into autonomous driving research for their promising generalization capabilities in OOD settings. Early studies demonstrated that VLMs could recognize OOD scenarios and generate user-level decisions such as "go straight" or "turn right." However, a new challenge has emerged due to the misalignment between the VLM's high-level decisions or visual reasoning expressed in language, and the low-level predicted trajectories interpreted as actions. In this paper, we propose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics. This approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in existing VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving scenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making under OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment issue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents in the context of autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-precision navigation and positioning systems are critical for applications in autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping, where robust and continuous localization is essential. To test and enhance the performance of algorithms, some research institutions and companies have successively constructed and publicly released datasets. However, existing datasets still suffer from limitations in sensor diversity and environmental coverage. To address these shortcomings and advance development in related fields, the SmartPNT Multisource Integrated Navigation, Positioning, and Attitude Dataset has been developed. This dataset integrates data from multiple sensors, including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), optical cameras, and LiDAR, to provide a rich and versatile resource for research in multi-sensor fusion and high-precision navigation. The dataset construction process is thoroughly documented, encompassing sensor configurations, coordinate system definitions, and calibration procedures for both cameras and LiDAR. A standardized framework for data collection and processing ensures consistency and scalability, enabling large-scale analysis. Validation using state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, such as VINS-Mono and LIO-SAM, demonstrates the dataset's applicability for advanced navigation research. Covering a wide range of real-world scenarios, including urban areas, campuses, tunnels, and suburban environments, the dataset offers a valuable tool for advancing navigation technologies and addressing challenges in complex environments. By providing a publicly accessible, high-quality dataset, this work aims to bridge gaps in sensor diversity, data accessibility, and environmental representation, fostering further innovation in the field.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Large Vision-Language Models, CIMR, multi-modal instructions, iterative reasoning

Summary:
CIMR is a novel framework designed to improve the capabilities of Large Language Models and Large Vision-Language Models when processing complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions. It introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and self-correction module that operates in two stages: initial reasoning and response generation, followed by iterative refinement using multi-modal feedback. The framework integrates textual, visual, and contextual features dynamically at each step to enhance performance. Fine-tuned on the Visual Instruction Tuning dataset, CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy on the Multi-modal Action Planning dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, and InstructBLIP. This demonstrates the efficacy of CIMR's iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in handling complex tasks involving logical reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enhanced our ability to process and generate human language and visual information. However, these models often struggle with complex, multi-step multi-modal instructions that require logical reasoning, dynamic feedback integration, and iterative self-correction. To address this, we propose CIMR: Contextualized Iterative Multimodal Reasoning, a novel framework that introduces a context-aware iterative reasoning and self-correction module. CIMR operates in two stages: initial reasoning and response generation, followed by iterative refinement using parsed multi-modal feedback. A dynamic fusion module deeply integrates textual, visual, and contextual features at each step. We fine-tune LLaVA-1.5-7B on the Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) dataset and evaluate CIMR on the newly introduced Multi-modal Action Planning (MAP) dataset. CIMR achieves 91.5% accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4V (89.2%), LLaVA-1.5 (78.5%), MiniGPT-4 (75.3%), and InstructBLIP (72.8%), demonstrating the efficacy of its iterative reasoning and self-correction capabilities in complex tasks.

<div> adaptation, vision-language models, CLIP, pseudo-labeling, unsupervised

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework for unsupervised adaptation in vision-language models like CLIP. Conventional pseudo-label filtering methods often fail in fully unsupervised settings due to noise in pseudo-labels. The proposed framework integrates prototype consistency and neighborhood-based consistency to enhance adaptation performance. PICS evaluates pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class feature compactness and cross-class feature separation, while NALR refines pseudo-labels dynamically using semantic similarities among neighboring samples. An adaptive weighting mechanism adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training based on their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised adaptation scenarios, providing more accurate pseudo-labels while maintaining computational efficiency. <div>

Abstract: In unsupervised adaptation for vision-language models such as CLIP, pseudo-labels derived from zero-shot predictions often exhibit significant noise, particularly under domain shifts or in visually complex scenarios. Conventional pseudo-label filtering approaches, which rely on fixed confidence thresholds, tend to be unreliable in fully unsupervised settings. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive pseudo-labeling framework that enhances CLIP's adaptation performance by integrating prototype consistency and neighborhood-based consistency. The proposed method comprises two key components: PICS, which assesses pseudo-label accuracy based on in-class feature compactness and cross-class feature separation; and NALR, which exploits semantic similarities among neighboring samples to refine pseudo-labels dynamically. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism that adjusts the influence of pseudo-labeled samples during training according to their estimated correctness. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised adaptation scenarios, delivering more accurate pseudo-labels while maintaining computational efficiency.

Summary: 
The article introduces a closed-loop framework called TIR to improve prompt sensitivity in text-to-image (T2I) generation models. The framework does not require additional training of the underlying T2I model. In TIR, a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the generated image and prompt at each step, refining the prompt based on detected misalignments. This iterative refinement process corrects errors and enhances visual coherence in image outputs. TIR showcases improved alignment and visual quality across benchmark datasets while maintaining compatibility with various T2I models. The approach mirrors the iterative refinement process employed by human artists, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing T2I model performance. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have made significant strides but still struggle with prompt sensitivity: even minor changes in prompt wording can yield inconsistent or inaccurate outputs. To address this challenge, we introduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no additional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach, each generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's prompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect attributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next round of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying alignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the iterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this closed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple benchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with black-box T2I models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element (FE) simulations of structures and materials are getting increasingly more accurate, but also more computationally expensive as a collateral result. This development happens in parallel with a growing demand of data-driven design. To reconcile the two, a robust and data-efficient optimization method called Bayesian optimization (BO) has been previously established as a technique to optimize expensive objective functions. In parallel, the mesh width of an FE model can be exploited to evaluate an objective at a lower or higher fidelity (cost & accuracy) level. The multi-fidelity setting applied to BO, called multi-fidelity BO (MFBO), has also seen previous success. However, BO and MFBO have not seen a direct comparison with when faced with with a real-life engineering problem, such as metamaterial design for deformation and absorption qualities. Moreover, sampling quality and assessing design parameter sensitivity is often an underrepresented part of data-driven design. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by employing Sobol' samples with variance-based sensitivity analysis in order to reduce design problem complexity. Furthermore, this work describes, implements, applies and compares the performance BO with that MFBO when maximizing the energy absorption (EA) problem of spinodoid cellular structures is concerned. The findings show that MFBO is an effective way to maximize the EA of a spinodoid structure and is able to outperform BO by up to 11% across various hyperparameter settings. The results, which are made open-source, serve to support the utility of multi-fidelity techniques across expensive data-driven design problems.

Summary: Sigmoid-Softsign (S3) and its improved version (S4) are introduced as hybrid activation functions to address limitations of traditional functions in deep neural networks. S3 combines sigmoid and softsign, while S4 has a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a parameter k. S4 outperformed nine baselines in binary and multi-class classification, and regression tasks, achieving high accuracy and faster convergence. It maintains stable gradient flow and addresses dead neuron and vanishing gradient issues. S4's gradient range is [0.24, 0.59], reducing dead neurons compared to ReLU. The tunable parameter k in S4 allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths, making it a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid activation functions in improving neural network training dynamics. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Activation functions are critical components in deep neural networks, directly influencing gradient flow, training stability, and model performance. Traditional functions like ReLU suffer from dead neuron problems, while sigmoid and tanh exhibit vanishing gradient issues. We introduce two novel hybrid activation functions: S3 (Sigmoid-Softsign) and its improved version S4 (smoothed S3). S3 combines sigmoid for negative inputs with softsign for positive inputs, while S4 employs a smooth transition mechanism controlled by a steepness parameter k. We conducted comprehensive experiments across binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression tasks using three different neural network architectures. S4 demonstrated superior performance compared to nine baseline activation functions, achieving 97.4% accuracy on MNIST, 96.0% on Iris classification, and 18.7 MSE on Boston Housing regression. The function exhibited faster convergence (-19 for ReLU) and maintained stable gradient flow across network depths. Comparative analysis revealed S4's gradient range of [0.24, 0.59] compared to ReLU's 18% dead neurons in deep networks. The S4 activation function addresses key limitations of existing functions through its hybrid design and smooth transition mechanism. The tunable parameter k allows adaptation to different tasks and network depths, making S4 a versatile choice for deep learning applications. These findings suggest that hybrid activation functions represent a promising direction for improving neural network training dynamics.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces a new approach for optimizing packet routing in communication networks using a spatial-temporal reinforcement learning framework. Traditional RL algorithms based on Markov Decision Processes may not capture the complexity of dynamic traffic patterns and network topologies. The proposed method integrates Graph Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture spatial dynamics and temporal traffic patterns, resulting in improved routing decisions. Evaluation shows that the approach outperforms traditional RL techniques and is more robust to changes in network topology. <div>
arXiv:2507.22174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a well-established approach for optimizing packet routing in communication networks. Standard RL algorithms typically are based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP), which assumes that the current state of the environment provides all the necessary information for system evolution and decision-making. However, this Markovian assumption is invalid in many practical scenarios, making the MDP and RL frameworks inadequate to produce the optimal solutions. Additionally, traditional RL algorithms often employ function approximations (e.g., by neural networks) that do not explicitly capture the spatial relationships inherent in environments with complex network topologies. Communication networks are characterized by dynamic traffic patterns and arbitrary numbers of nodes and links, which further complicate the decision-making process. To address these challenges, we propose a spatial-temporal RL approach that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to adequately capture the spatial dynamics regarding network topology and temporal traffic patterns, respectively, to enhance routing decisions. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms and is more robust to changes in the network topology when compared with traditional RL techniques.

Summary:
SourceGrasp and SourceSplice are introduced to address the challenge of selecting the best subset of data sources for constructing training datasets in machine learning tasks. SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic approach based on greediness and randomization, while SourceSplice is inspired by gene splicing to select sources efficiently. Empirical evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets show that SourceSplice outperforms in identifying subsets of data sources that maximize task utility with fewer explorations. The algorithms consider that sources contribute differently to task utility and must be carefully chosen. Sensitivity studies on SourceSplice's decision choices under various settings provide insights into its performance. This research highlights the importance of considering source quality for optimal performance in machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Data quality plays a pivotal role in the predictive performance of machine learning (ML) tasks - a challenge amplified by the deluge of data sources available in modern organizations.Prior work in data discovery largely focus on metadata matching, semantic similarity or identifying tables that should be joined to answer a particular query, but do not consider source quality for high performance of the downstream ML task.This paper addresses the problem of determining the best subset of data sources that must be combined to construct the underlying training dataset for a given ML task.We propose SourceGrasp and SourceSplice, frameworks designed to efficiently select a suitable subset of sources that maximizes the utility of the downstream ML model.Both the algorithms rely on the core idea that sources (or their combinations) contribute differently to the task utility, and must be judiciously chosen.While SourceGrasp utilizes a metaheuristic based on a greediness criterion and randomization, the SourceSplice framework presents a source selection mechanism inspired from gene splicing - a core concept used in protein synthesis.We empirically evaluate our algorithms on three real-world datasets and synthetic datasets and show that, with significantly fewer subset explorations, SourceSplice effectively identifies subsets of data sources leading to high task utility.We also conduct studies reporting the sensitivity of SourceSplice to the decision choices under several settings.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a distribution-based method for measuring the similarity of time-series datasets using the Wasserstein distance. By treating time-series datasets as empirical instances of underlying multivariate normal distributions, the similarity between two datasets is calculated as the Wasserstein distance between their corresponding distributions. The approach is shown to be effective in identifying similar time-series datasets and estimating the performance of foundation models in various scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a high correlation between the proposed similarity measure and inference loss, indicating its utility in model selection, finetuning, and visualization. The Wasserstein distance proves particularly valuable in out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation, providing a reliable measure of similarity that aids in model comparison and inference performance estimation.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The emergence of time-series foundation model research elevates the growing need to measure the (dis)similarity of time-series datasets. A time-series dataset similarity measure aids research in multiple ways, including model selection, finetuning, and visualization. In this paper, we propose a distribution-based method to measure time-series dataset similarity by leveraging the Wasserstein distance. We consider a time-series dataset an empirical instantiation of an underlying multivariate normal distribution (MVN). The similarity between two time-series datasets is thus computed as the Wasserstein distance between their corresponding MVNs. Comprehensive experiments and visualization show the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, we show how the Wasserstein distance helps identify similar time-series datasets and facilitates inference performance estimation of foundation models in both out-of-distribution and transfer learning evaluation, with high correlations between our proposed measure and the inference loss (>0.60).

By following established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight offers a holistic classification of fetal health with high accuracy and F1-score. It outperforms deep learning models and single-agent LLM baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results (96.4% accuracy and 97.8% F1-score). Additionally, CTG-Insight provides transparent and interpretable outputs, enhancing the understanding of raw CTG data for expectant parents.

Abstract: Remote fetal monitoring technologies are becoming increasingly common. Yet, most current systems offer limited interpretability, leaving expectant parents with raw cardiotocography (CTG) data that is difficult to understand. In this work, we present CTG-Insight, a multi-agent LLM system that provides structured interpretations of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals. Drawing from established medical guidelines, CTG-Insight decomposes each CTG trace into five medically defined features: baseline, variability, accelerations, decelerations, and sinusoidal pattern, each analyzed by a dedicated agent. A final aggregation agent synthesizes the outputs to deliver a holistic classification of fetal health, accompanied by a natural language explanation. We evaluate CTG-Insight on the NeuroFetalNet Dataset and compare it against deep learning models and the single-agent LLM baseline. Results show that CTG-Insight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (96.4%) and F1-score (97.8%) while producing transparent and interpretable outputs. This work contributes an interpretable and extensible CTG analysis framework.

Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential to the operation of modern electric power systems. Given the sensitivity of electricity demand to weather variability and temporal dynamics, capturing non-linear patterns is essential for long-term planning.

Midterm forecasting has shown to be crucial for maintenance scheduling, resource allocation, financial forecasting, and market participation. The paper places a focus on the use of a method called "Shapley Additive Explanations" (SHAP) to improve model explainability. SHAP enables the quantification of feature contributions, guiding informed feature engineering and improving both model transparency and forecasting accuracy.

Summary: 
Neuroscience has traditionally been fragmented into specialized domains, hindering the development of a unified model of cognition. The TRIBE deep neural network predicts brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas, and individuals, utilizing pretrained representations of text, audio, and video models. By integrating these modalities and utilizing a transformer for time-evolving data, TRIBE accurately models spatial and temporal fMRI responses to videos, outperforming competitors in the Algonauts 2025 brain encoding competition. While unimodal models excel in predicting corresponding cortical networks, the multimodal TRIBE model surpasses them in high-level associative cortices. Applied initially to perception and comprehension, TRIBE's approach sets the foundation for constructing an integrated model of brain representations to better understand human cognition. The code for TRIBE is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Historically, neuroscience has progressed by fragmenting into specialized domains, each focusing on isolated modalities, tasks, or brain regions. While fruitful, this approach hinders the development of a unified model of cognition. Here, we introduce TRIBE, the first deep neural network trained to predict brain responses to stimuli across multiple modalities, cortical areas and individuals. By combining the pretrained representations of text, audio and video foundational models and handling their time-evolving nature with a transformer, our model can precisely model the spatial and temporal fMRI responses to videos, achieving the first place in the Algonauts 2025 brain encoding competition with a significant margin over competitors. Ablations show that while unimodal models can reliably predict their corresponding cortical networks (e.g. visual or auditory networks), they are systematically outperformed by our multimodal model in high-level associative cortices. Currently applied to perception and comprehension, our approach paves the way towards building an integrative model of representations in the human brain.

<div> framework, dataset construction, optimization, pre-training, scaling laws

Summary:
The article introduces a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction in foundation model training. It focuses on estimating the quality of data sources to make optimal decisions about resource allocation for the pre-training phase. By analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, the approach extends point estimate approaches to estimating scaling laws. This enables cost-effective resource allocation for different data acquisition methods and sources. Experiments on a 7 billion-parameter pre-trained model validate the approach. It shows that by running multiple annealing runs, one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of data sources, leading to different conclusions than using point estimates. This data-driven decision-making approach enhances the selection and optimization of data sources for training specialized models. <div>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for optimizing domain-specific dataset construction in foundation model training. Specifically, we seek a cost-efficient way to estimate the quality of data sources (e.g. synthetically generated or filtered web data, etc.) in order to make optimal decisions about resource allocation for data sourcing from these sources for the stage two pre-training phase, aka annealing, with the goal of specializing a generalist pre-trained model to specific domains. Our approach extends the usual point estimate approaches, aka micro-annealing, to estimating scaling laws by performing multiple annealing runs of varying compute spent on data curation and training. This addresses a key limitation in prior work, where reliance on point estimates for data scaling decisions can be misleading due to the lack of rank invariance across compute scales -- a phenomenon we confirm in our experiments. By systematically analyzing performance gains relative to acquisition costs, we find that scaling curves can be estimated for different data sources. Such scaling laws can inform cost effective resource allocation across different data acquisition methods (e.g. synthetic data), data sources (e.g. user or web data) and available compute resources. We validate our approach through experiments on a pre-trained model with 7 billion parameters. We adapt it to: a domain well-represented in the pre-training data -- the medical domain, and a domain underrepresented in the pretraining corpora -- the math domain. We show that one can efficiently estimate the scaling behaviors of a data source by running multiple annealing runs, which can lead to different conclusions, had one used point estimates using the usual micro-annealing technique instead. This enables data-driven decision-making for selecting and optimizing data sources.

<div> Keywords: general intelligence, representational empowerment, adaptability, knowledge structures, internal representations  
Summary:  
- The traditional focus on external objectives in the pursuit of general intelligence is shifting towards a new paradigm of representational empowerment.  
- Representational empowerment involves an agent's ability to control and diversify its own knowledge structures, emphasizing internal control rather than external mastery.  
- This approach aims to create adaptable intelligent systems by focusing on shaping internal representations as a means of achieving better preparedness.  
- By measuring an agent's capacity to shape its own understanding, representational empowerment offers a new perspective on achieving true adaptability in artificial intelligence.  
- Viewing internal representations as the primary substrate for computing empowerment provides a unique lens for designing intelligent systems that are highly adaptable and capable of self-improvement.

Abstract: The pursuit of general intelligence has traditionally centered on external objectives: an agent's control over its environments or mastery of specific tasks. This external focus, however, can produce specialized agents that lack adaptability. We propose representational empowerment, a new perspective towards a truly agent-centric learning paradigm by moving the locus of control inward. This objective measures an agent's ability to controllably maintain and diversify its own knowledge structures. We posit that the capacity -- to shape one's own understanding -- is an element for achieving better ``preparedness'' distinct from direct environmental influence. Focusing on internal representations as the main substrate for computing empowerment offers a new lens through which to design adaptable intelligent systems.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Conditional flow matching (CFM) is a powerful framework for training continuous normalizing flows. However, standard CFM can produce non-straight paths between prior and target distributions, leading to slower and less accurate generations. Weighted Conditional Flow Matching (W-CFM) addresses this issue by modifying the CFM loss with a Gibbs kernel, improving trajectory straightness. W-CFM recovers entropic optimal transport coupling and shows equivalence to mini-batch OT in large-batch sizes. Empirical tests on various datasets demonstrate W-CFM's ability to achieve high sample quality, fidelity, and diversity comparable to other baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. <div>

Abstract: Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals, and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality, fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.

<div> Keywords: Cross-validation, Clustering algorithms, Mini Batch K-Means, Bias, Variance

Summary: 
Cluster-based cross-validation strategies were examined to address biases in model performance evaluation in machine learning. Different clustering algorithms were compared, and a new technique combining Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification was proposed. Experimental results on 20 datasets showed that this technique outperformed others in bias and variance on balanced datasets but did not reduce computational cost significantly. Traditional stratified cross-validation was found to be more effective for imbalanced datasets, showing lower bias, variance, and computational cost. No single clustering algorithm consistently outperformed others. This work contributes to enhancing model evaluation strategies, emphasizing the reliability of established techniques like stratified cross-validation and providing insights for improving performance evaluation in datasets with clustering characteristics. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-validation plays a fundamental role in Machine Learning, enabling robust evaluation of model performance and preventing overestimation on training and validation data. However, one of its drawbacks is the potential to create data subsets (folds) that do not adequately represent the diversity of the original dataset, which can lead to biased performance estimates. The objective of this work is to deepen the investigation of cluster-based cross-validation strategies by analyzing the performance of different clustering algorithms through experimental comparison. Additionally, a new cross-validation technique that combines Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification is proposed. Experiments were conducted on 20 datasets (both balanced and imbalanced) using four supervised learning algorithms, comparing cross-validation strategies in terms of bias, variance, and computational cost. The technique that uses Mini Batch K-Means with class stratification outperformed others in terms of bias and variance on balanced datasets, though it did not significantly reduce computational cost. On imbalanced datasets, traditional stratified cross-validation consistently performed better, showing lower bias, variance, and computational cost, making it a safe choice for performance evaluation in scenarios with class imbalance. In the comparison of different clustering algorithms, no single algorithm consistently stood out as superior. Overall, this work contributes to improving predictive model evaluation strategies by providing a deeper understanding of the potential of cluster-based data splitting techniques and reaffirming the effectiveness of well-established strategies like stratified cross-validation. Moreover, it highlights perspectives for increasing the robustness and reliability of model evaluations, especially in datasets with clustering characteristics.

<div> Compressed Sensing, Shallow Recurrent Decoder, Reconstruction, Spatiotemporal Dynamics, Adaptive Loss Function

Summary:
$\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ is a novel deep learning architecture that combines Compressed Sensing with a Shallow Recurrent Decoder to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete or corrupted data. It utilizes a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$ regularization and an adaptive loss function combining MSE, MAE, and SNR regularization to robustly recover signals in challenging scenarios. The method shows significant improvements in reconstruction fidelity compared to traditional approaches, with better preservation of small-scale structures and increased robustness against noise and outliers. The jointly trained CS and SHRED design architecture, including an LSTM sequence model and shallow decoder network, proves effective in characterizing temporal evolution and modeling high-dimensional state spaces. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function enhances spatiotemporal data recovery, making $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ a promising tool for various environmental, climatic, and scientific data analysis applications.

arXiv:2507.22303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder ($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete, compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture, our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$ regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and scientific data analyses.

Summary: 
The paper focuses on addressing client model heterogeneity in personalized federated learning without relying on external data or requiring disclosure of client model architectures. The proposed framework, MH-pFedHN, utilizes a server-side hypernetwork to generate personalized parameters for each client's heterogeneous model.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized federated learning have focused on addressing client model heterogeneity. However, most existing methods still require external data, rely on model decoupling, or adopt partial learning strategies, which can limit their practicality and scalability. In this paper, we revisit hypernetwork-based methods and leverage their strong generalization capabilities to design a simple yet effective framework for heterogeneous personalized federated learning. Specifically, we propose MH-pFedHN, which leverages a server-side hypernetwork that takes client-specific embedding vectors as input and outputs personalized parameters tailored to each client's heterogeneous model. To promote knowledge sharing and reduce computation, we introduce a multi-head structure within the hypernetwork, allowing clients with similar model sizes to share heads. Furthermore, we further propose MH-pFedHNGD, which integrates an optional lightweight global model to improve generalization. Our framework does not rely on external datasets and does not require disclosure of client model architectures, thereby offering enhanced privacy and flexibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and model settings demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive accuracy, strong generalization, and serves as a robust baseline for future research in model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning.

<div> Keywords: deep learning, sequential decision-making, facility location, path optimization, neural networks

Summary:
<br />
The paper introduces a scalable deep learning framework, ParaSDM, for parametrized sequential decision-making problems where multiple agents optimize discrete action policies and shared continuous parameters. Specifically, the framework is applied to Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO) tasks, where agents must determine optimal routes and facility locations to minimize transportation costs within a network. The proposed Shortest Path Network (SPN) neural policy model, integrated with the Maximum Entropy Principle, achieves significant speedups in policy inference and gradient computation over traditional MEP baselines. The FLPO approach outperforms metaheuristic methods in cost efficiency while matching the optimal cost achieved by Gurobi with a substantial speedup. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured deep models in solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization problems.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.

MSQ utilizes round-clamp quantizer for differentiable computation of least significant bits (LSBs) and induces sparsity in these LSBs through regularization.

MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous quantization methods while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression rates. This approach offers a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on resource-constrained devices. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) see increased deployment on mobile and edge devices, optimizing model efficiency has become crucial. Mixed-precision quantization is widely favored, as it offers a superior balance between efficiency and accuracy compared to uniform quantization. However, finding the optimal precision for each layer is challenging. Recent studies utilizing bit-level sparsity have shown promise, yet they often introduce substantial training complexity and high GPU memory requirements. In this paper, we propose Memory-Efficient Bit Sparsification Quantization (MSQ), a novel approach that addresses these limitations. MSQ applies a round-clamp quantizer to enable differentiable computation of the least significant bits (LSBs) from model weights. It further employs regularization to induce sparsity in these LSBs, enabling effective precision reduction without explicit bit-level parameter splitting. Additionally, MSQ incorporates Hessian information, allowing the simultaneous pruning of multiple LSBs to further enhance training efficiency. Experimental results show that MSQ achieves up to 8.00x reduction in trainable parameters and up to 86% reduction in training time compared to previous bit-level quantization, while maintaining competitive accuracy and compression rates. This makes it a practical solution for training efficient DNNs on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made substantial progress by leveraging the robust capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, VLMs' significant parameter size and autoregressive (AR) decoding nature impose considerable computational demands on VLA models. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has shown efficacy in accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating efficient drafting and parallel verification, allowing multiple tokens to be generated in one forward pass, its application to VLA models remains unexplored. This work introduces Spec-VLA, an SD framework designed to accelerate VLA models. Due to the difficulty of the action prediction task and the greedy decoding mechanism of the VLA models, the direct application of the advanced SD framework to the VLA prediction task yields a minor speed improvement. To boost the generation speed, we propose an effective mechanism to relax acceptance utilizing the relative distances represented by the action tokens of the VLA model. Empirical results across diverse test scenarios affirm the effectiveness of the Spec-VLA framework, and further analysis substantiates the impact of our proposed strategies, which enhance the acceptance length by 44%, achieving 1.42 times speedup compared with the OpenVLA baseline, without compromising the success rate. The success of the Spec-VLA framework highlights the potential for broader application of speculative execution in VLA prediction scenarios.

Summary:
This paper analyzes the impact of floating-point computation errors on gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy loss. The study covers four scenarios of attack outcomes and identifies floating-point underflow and rounding as significant factors contributing to gradient computation instability. A new loss function, T-MIFPE, is proposed to minimize the influence of floating-point errors by incorporating an optimal scaling factor. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss functions in terms of attack potency and robustness evaluation accuracy.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial attacks using the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often suffer from overestimation due to relative errors in gradient computation induced by floating-point arithmetic. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of these errors, conducting the first comprehensive study of floating-point computation errors in gradient-based attacks across four distinct scenarios: (i) unsuccessful untargeted attacks, (ii) successful untargeted attacks, (iii) unsuccessful targeted attacks, and (iv) successful targeted attacks. We establish theoretical foundations characterizing the behavior of relative numerical errors under different attack conditions, revealing previously unknown patterns in gradient computation instability, and identify floating-point underflow and rounding as key contributors. Building on this insight, we propose the Theoretical MIFPE (T-MIFPE) loss function, which incorporates an optimal scaling factor $T = t^*$ to minimize the impact of floating-point errors, thereby enhancing the accuracy of gradient computation in adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that T-MIFPE outperforms existing loss functions, including CE, C\&amp;W, DLR, and MIFPE, in terms of attack potency and robustness evaluation accuracy.

Abstract: Network alignment has attracted widespread attention in various fields. However, most existing works mainly focus on the problem of label sparsity, while overlooking the issue of noise in network alignment, which can substantially undermine model performance. Such noise mainly includes structural noise from noisy edges and labeling noise caused by human-induced and process-driven errors. To address these problems, we propose RANA, a Robust Active learning framework for noisy Network Alignment. RANA effectively tackles both structure noise and label noise while addressing the sparsity of anchor link annotations, which can improve the robustness of network alignment models. Specifically, RANA introduces the proposed Noise-aware Selection Module and the Label Denoising Module to address structural noise and labeling noise, respectively. In the first module, we design a noise-aware maximization objective to select node pairs, incorporating a cleanliness score to address structural noise. In the second module, we propose a novel multi-source fusion denoising strategy that leverages model and twin node pairs labeling to provide more accurate labels for node pairs. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RANA outperforms state-of-the-art active learning-based methods in alignment accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/YXNan0110/RANA.

This paper investigates activation functions as a crucial yet underexplored component for enhancing model robustness. We propose a Rademacher Complexity Reduction Activation Function (RCR-AF), a novel activation function designed to improve both generalization and adversarial resilience. RCR-AF uniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient stability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable monotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity through built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity, demonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher complexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive empirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used alternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard training and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable prediction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is essential for managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and supporting clinical decisions. Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown strong potential in clinical prediction tasks due to their ability to process visual and textual information. However, challenges related to deployment cost, data privacy, and model reliability hinder their adoption. In this study, we propose a collaborative framework that enhances the performance of open-source LMMs for eGFR forecasting while generating clinically meaningful explanations. The framework incorporates visual knowledge transfer, abductive reasoning, and a short-term memory mechanism to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves predictive performance and interpretability comparable to proprietary models. It also provides plausible clinical reasoning processes behind each prediction. Our method sheds new light on building AI systems for healthcare that combine predictive accuracy with clinically grounded interpretability.

<div> Keywords: vertical federated learning, class imbalance, dual prototypes, feature aggregation, convergence rate <br />
Summary: 
Proto-EVFL addresses challenges in vertical federated learning by introducing dual prototypes to handle class imbalance issues. Class prototypes help learn relationships between classes, enabling prediction of unseen classes. A probabilistic dual prototype learning scheme dynamically selects unaligned samples based on optimal transport cost and class prior probability. A mixed prior guided module combines local and global class probabilities to guide sample selection. An adaptive gated feature aggregation strategy mitigates feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically weighting and aggregating local features across parties. Proto-EVFL is the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL with a convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Experimental results show Proto-EVFL outperforms baselines, even in a zero-shot scenario with one unseen class, demonstrating its superiority in handling class imbalance and improving model performance. <br />

arXiv:2507.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vertical federated learning (VFL), multiple enterprises address aligned sample scarcity by leveraging massive locally unaligned samples to facilitate collaborative learning. However, unaligned samples across different parties in VFL can be extremely class-imbalanced, leading to insufficient feature representation and limited model prediction space. Specifically, class-imbalanced problems consist of intra-party class imbalance and inter-party class imbalance, which can further cause local model bias and feature contribution inconsistency issues, respectively. To address the above challenges, we propose Proto-EVFL, an enhanced VFL framework via dual prototypes. We first introduce class prototypes for each party to learn relationships between classes in the latent space, allowing the active party to predict unseen classes. We further design a probabilistic dual prototype learning scheme to dynamically select unaligned samples by conditional optimal transport cost with class prior probability. Moreover, a mixed prior guided module guides this selection process by combining local and global class prior probabilities. Finally, we adopt an \textit{adaptive gated feature aggregation strategy} to mitigate feature contribution inconsistency by dynamically weighting and aggregating local features across different parties. We proved that Proto-EVFL, as the first bi-level optimization framework in VFL, has a convergence rate of 1/\sqrt T. Extensive experiments on various datasets validate the superiority of our Proto-EVFL. Even in a zero-shot scenario with one unseen class, it outperforms baselines by at least 6.97%

<div> machine unlearning, harmful content, generative models, Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning, data difficulty

Summary:
Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn) is introduced as a technique to address the risks of harmful content generation in machine learning models. Existing machine unlearning methods often treat all data equally, making it challenging to effectively forget difficult data. The authors demonstrate that the loss of data can reflect its difficulty, leading to the development of LoReUn. This approach dynamically reweights data during the unlearning process, improving the prevention of harmful content in image classification and generation tasks. LoReUn bridges the gap between existing machine unlearning methods and exact unlearning, with minimal computational overhead. The results show enhanced performance in preventing harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models. <div>
arXiv:2507.22499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generative models face significant risks of producing harmful content, which has underscored the importance of machine unlearning (MU) as a critical technique for eliminating the influence of undesired data. However, existing MU methods typically assign the same weight to all data to be forgotten, which makes it difficult to effectively forget certain data that is harder to unlearn than others. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the loss of data itself can implicitly reflect its varying difficulty. Building on this insight, we introduce Loss-based Reweighting Unlearning (LoReUn), a simple yet effective plug-and-play strategy that dynamically reweights data during the unlearning process with minimal additional computational overhead. Our approach significantly reduces the gap between existing MU methods and exact unlearning in both image classification and generation tasks, effectively enhancing the prevention of harmful content generation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: Forecast reconciliation, an ex-post technique applied to forecasts that must satisfy constraints, has been a prominent topic in the forecasting literature over the past two decades. Recently, several efforts have sought to extend reconciliation methods to the probabilistic settings. Nevertheless, formal theorems demonstrating error reduction in nonlinear contexts, analogous to those presented in Panagiotelis et al.(2021), are still lacking. This paper addresses that gap by establishing such theorems for various classes of nonlinear hypersurfaces and vector-valued functions. Specifically, we derive an exact analog of Theorem 3.1 from Panagiotelis et al.(2021) for hypersurfaces with constant-sign curvature. Additionally, we provide probabilistic guarantees for the broader case of hypersurfaces with non-constant-sign curvature and for general vector-valued functions. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release a JAX-based Python package, \emph{to be released upon publication}, implementing the presented theorems and reconciliation procedures.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is an increasingly critical task within drug discovery and development. Typically, neural networks can learn molecular properties using graph-based, language-based or feature-based methods. Recent advances in natural language processing have highlighted the capabilities of neural networks to learn complex human language using masked language modelling. These approaches to training large transformer-based deep learning models have also been used to learn the language of molecules, as represented by simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Here, we present novel domain-specific text-to-text pretraining tasks that yield improved performance in six classification-based molecular property prediction benchmarks, relative to both traditional likelihood-based training and previously proposed fine-tuning tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that data and computational efficiency can be improved by using these domain-specific pretraining tasks. Finally, the pretrained embeddings from the model can be used as fixed inputs into a downstream machine learning classifier and yield comparable performance to finetuning but with much lower computational overhead.

<div> Fractional Gaussian filter, pruning, computational complexity, Adaptive Unstructured Pruning, compression ratios <br />
<br />Summary: <br />
Network compression techniques are crucial for deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices. The Fractional Gaussian Filters and Pruning (FGFP) framework introduced in this study leverages fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian functions to construct efficient filters with minimal parameters. By utilizing Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate fractional differential equations, computational complexity is reduced. The FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and compression performance compared to recent methods. For instance, on CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves a minor 1.52% accuracy drop while reducing model size by 85.2%, and on ImageNet2012, ResNet-50 achieves just a 1.63% accuracy decrease while reducing model size by 69.1%. <div>

Abstract: Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent years because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge devices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP) framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a 1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012, ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 69.1%.

Summary:<br />
Traffic congestion caused by uncertainties like accidents is a major problem in urban areas, leading to delays, emissions, and safety risks. To tackle this issue, a robust framework is proposed for predicting accident impact on congestion. Automated Machine Learning-enhanced Deep Embedding Clustering is used to assign congestion labels to accident data, while a Bayesian Network predicts congestion probability. The Simulation of Urban Mobility is employed to validate the Bayesian Network's predictions with evidence-based scenarios.

Abstract: Traffic congestion due to uncertainties, such as accidents, is a significant issue in urban areas, as the ripple effect of accidents causes longer delays, increased emissions, and safety concerns. To address this issue, we propose a robust framework for predicting the impact of accidents on congestion. We implement Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)-enhanced Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC) to assign congestion labels to accident data and predict congestion probability using a Bayesian Network (BN). The Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation is utilized to evaluate the correctness of BN predictions using evidence-based scenarios. Results demonstrate that the AutoML-enhanced DEC has outperformed traditional clustering approaches. The performance of the proposed BN model achieved an overall accuracy of 95.6%, indicating its ability to understand the complex relationship of accidents causing congestion. Validation in SUMO with evidence-based scenarios demonstrated that the BN model's prediction of congestion states closely matches those of SUMO, indicating the high reliability of the proposed BN model in ensuring smooth urban mobility.

Summary:
Tokenization is a crucial aspect of natural language processing and other sequence modeling fields, with vocabulary size playing a significant role in model performance. Traditional methods of selecting vocabulary size often rely on heuristics or dataset-specific choices. This work introduces a systematic approach for determining vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions using Zipf's law. The study shows a strong correlation between downstream task performance and adherence to power-law behavior, indicating that aligning with Zipfian scaling can enhance both model efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results across various domains such as NLP, genomics, and chemistry consistently show that models achieve optimal performance when token distributions closely follow Zipf's law. This research establishes Zipfian alignment as a robust and generalizable criterion for selecting vocabulary size.

Summary: <br />
The article presents a novel deep learning-based approach called Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4) to improve mapping of urban morphology in developing economies for sustainable development and disaster risk reduction. This approach integrates local census statistics as cluster-level constraints and considers multiple conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning process. By enhancing the quality of mapping in Rwanda at a third-level administrative unit using the 2022 census data, DeepC4 addresses challenges related to model uncertainties and discrepancies with validated census statistics. This advance in spatial disaggregation techniques offers a way to audit existing coarse-grained information derived from satellite imagery and geospatial datasets at large scales, contributing to a better understanding of urban environments and vulnerabilities for informed decision-making towards achieving global frameworks by 2030. <br /> <div>

Abstract: To understand our global progress for sustainable development and disaster risk reduction in many developing economies, two recent major initiatives - the Uniform African Exposure Dataset of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation and the Modelling Exposure through Earth Observation Routines (METEOR) Project - implemented classical spatial disaggregation techniques to generate large-scale mapping of urban morphology using the information from various satellite imagery and its derivatives, geospatial datasets of the built environment, and subnational census statistics. However, the local discrepancy with well-validated census statistics and the propagated model uncertainties remain a challenge in such coarse-to-fine-grained mapping problems, specifically constrained by weak and conditional label supervision. Therefore, we present Deep Conditional Census-Constrained Clustering (DeepC4), a novel deep learning-based spatial disaggregation approach that incorporates local census statistics as cluster-level constraints while considering multiple conditional label relationships in a joint multitask learning of the patterns of satellite imagery. To demonstrate, compared to GEM and METEOR, we enhanced the quality of Rwandan maps of urban morphology, specifically building exposure and physical vulnerability, at the third-level administrative unit from the 2022 census. As the world approaches the conclusion of our global frameworks in 2030, our work has offered a new deep learning-based mapping technique towards a spatial auditing of our existing coarse-grained derived information at large scales.

Abstract: Evaluating the performance of closely matched machine learning(ML) models under specific conditions has long been a focus of researchers in the field of machine learning. The Rashomon set is a collection of closely matched ML models, encompassing a wide range of models with similar accuracies but different structures. Traditionally, the analysis of these sets has focused on vertical structural analysis, which involves comparing the corresponding features at various levels within the ML models. However, there has been a lack of effective visualization methods for horizontally comparing multiple models with specific features. We propose the VAR visualization solution. VAR uses visualization to perform comparisons of ML models within the Rashomon set. This solution combines heatmaps and scatter plots to facilitate the comparison. With the help of VAR, ML model developers can identify the optimal model under specific conditions and better understand the Rashomon set's overall characteristics.

<div> framework, differential privacy, deep reinforcement learning, language models, privacy budget
Summary:
The article introduces RLDP, a novel framework that integrates differential privacy optimization with deep reinforcement learning for improving the trade-off between data privacy and model utility in large language models trained on sensitive datasets. RLDP dynamically adjusts gradient-clipping thresholds and noise magnitude per parameter during model training to optimize utility while maintaining privacy guarantees. Through extensive experiments on various language models, RLDP achieves significant perplexity reductions and downstream utility gains, outperforming existing methods. It accelerates model training by efficiently allocating the privacy budget, reducing the gradient-update budget by up to 71%. RLDP also demonstrates robustness against privacy attacks while honoring differential privacy constraints. <div>
arXiv:2507.22565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tension between data privacy and model utility has become the defining bottleneck for the practical deployment of large language models (LLMs) trained on sensitive corpora including healthcare. Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a pronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise, degrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been proposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control knobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization landscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy budget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay within privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP optimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep reinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the learning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter gradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian noise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language model fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget where it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation experiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers perplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream utility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of the gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same ($\epsilon$, $\delta$)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility to membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.

<div> monotone matrices, deep learning, explainable AI, matrix classification, characteristic polynomial
Summary: 
This work introduces a novel methodology that combines deep learning with explainable AI to classify matrices based on abstract algebraic properties. By leveraging neural networks and XAI techniques, interpretable rules are derived from learned strategies. Focusing on monotone matrices with nonnegative inverses, the study establishes a dataset from randomly generated matrices in the range of (-1,1). Through deep neural network algorithms, it is determined that the absolute values of the two lowest-order coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, denoted as $c_0$ and $c_1, are sufficient for accurate classification. A data-driven analysis of 18,000 random $7\times7$ matrices reveals a probabilistic bound of $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$ for identifying monotone matrices. This constraint translates to a minimal trace of $5.7$ for the inverse of a monotone matrix. <div>

Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$ matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$ with probability $>99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert = 1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound $\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.

<div> Keywords: cell division, plant tissue organization, cell geometry, deep neural network, Arabidopsis thaliana embryo cells

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on the positioning of new cellular walls during cell division in plants, a key factor in shaping tissue organization. Traditional approaches have relied on predefined geometrical rules to link cell shape to division orientation, leading to limitations in understanding complex division patterns. In this work, a data-based approach utilizing deep neural networks is introduced to investigate the relationship between cell geometry and division plane positioning. By training a UNet architecture on image-based cell representations, the model successfully predicts division patterns based on mother cell geometry, even for previously unexplainable embryo division patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana. These findings demonstrate the potential of deep networks in unraveling complex cell division mechanisms and generating new hypotheses for the control of division positioning.<br />

Abstract: The positioning of new cellular walls during cell division plays a key role in shaping plant tissue organization. The influence of cell geometry on the positioning of division planes has been previously captured into various geometrical rules. Accordingly, linking cell shape to division orientation has relied on the comparison between observed division patterns and predictions under specific rules. The need to define a priori the tested rules is a fundamental limitation of this hypothesis-driven approach. As an alternative, we introduce a data-based approach to investigate the relation between cell geometry and division plane positioning, exploiting the ability of deep neural network to learn complex relationships across multidimensional spaces. Adopting an image-based cell representation, we show how division patterns can be learned and predicted from mother cell geometry using a UNet architecture modified to operate on cell masks. Using synthetic data and A. thaliana embryo cells, we evaluate the model performances on a wide range of diverse cell shapes and division patterns. We find that the trained model accounted for embryo division patterns that were previously irreconcilable under existing geometrical rules. Our work shows the potential of deep networks to understand cell division patterns and to generate new hypotheses on the control of cell division positioning.

Summary:  
H2Tune addresses the challenges of heterogeneous task requirements and resource limitations in hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning. It introduces sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden dimensions, relation-guided matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures, and alternating task-knowledge disentanglement mechanism to separate shared and specific knowledge. The proposed framework guarantees convergence with a rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Experimental results demonstrate H2Tune outperforms existing methods by up to 15.4% in accuracy. The code for H2Tune is publicly available for further exploration. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from existing federated fine-tuning (FFT) methods for foundation models, hybrid heterogeneous federated fine-tuning (HHFFT) is an under-explored scenario where clients exhibit double heterogeneity in model architectures and downstream tasks. This hybrid heterogeneity introduces two significant challenges: 1) heterogeneous matrix aggregation, where clients adopt different large-scale foundation models based on their task requirements and resource limitations, leading to dimensional mismatches during LoRA parameter aggregation; and 2) multi-task knowledge interference, where local shared parameters, trained with both task-shared and task-specific knowledge, cannot ensure only task-shared knowledge is transferred between clients. To address these challenges, we propose H2Tune, a federated foundation model fine-tuning with hybrid heterogeneity. Our framework H2Tune consists of three key components: (i) sparsified triple matrix decomposition to align hidden dimensions across clients through constructing rank-consistent middle matrices, with adaptive sparsification based on client resources; (ii) relation-guided matrix layer alignment to handle heterogeneous layer structures and representation capabilities; and (iii) alternating task-knowledge disentanglement mechanism to decouple shared and specific knowledge of local model parameters through alternating optimization. Theoretical analysis proves a convergence rate of O(1/\sqrt{T}). Extensive experiments show our method achieves up to 15.4% accuracy improvement compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary:
Transductive learning, a type of supervised machine learning, involves labeling a finite set of unlabelled data available at training time. This context, affected by dataset shift, presents challenges when the Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) assumption does not hold. The proposed method for transductive classification tackles model selection, specifically hyperparameter optimization, in the presence of prior probability shift common in anti-causal learning problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on cross-validation of labeled training data, this method optimizes hyperparameters directly on the unlabelled data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing model performance in transductive classification tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transductive learning is a supervised machine learning task in which, unlike in traditional inductive learning, the unlabelled data that require labelling are a finite set and are available at training time. Similarly to inductive learning contexts, transductive learning contexts may be affected by dataset shift, i.e., may be such that the IID assumption does not hold. We here propose a method, tailored to transductive classification contexts, for performing model selection (i.e., hyperparameter optimisation) when the data exhibit prior probability shift, an important type of dataset shift typical of anti-causal learning problems. In our proposed method the hyperparameters can be optimised directly on the unlabelled data to which the trained classifier must be applied; this is unlike traditional model selection methods, that are based on performing cross-validation on the labelled training data. We provide experimental results that show the benefits brought about by our method.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a visualization method and system to enhance the interpretability of random forests, a machine learning technique composed of multiple decision trees. The approach clusters similar decision trees to facilitate understanding the model's overall performance without the need to analyze each tree individually. A new distance metric considering decision rules and predictions of tree pairs is proposed for meaningful clustering. The Feature Plot visualizes the topological positions of features, while the Rule Plot displays decision rules, aiding in interpretation. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a case study on the "Glass" dataset and a small user study, showcasing its potential for improving the interpretability of random forests. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Random forests are a machine learning method used to automatically classify datasets and consist of a multitude of decision trees. While these random forests often have higher performance and generalize better than a single decision tree, they are also harder to interpret. This paper presents a visualization method and system to increase interpretability of random forests. We cluster similar trees which enables users to interpret how the model performs in general without needing to analyze each individual decision tree in detail, or interpret an oversimplified summary of the full forest. To meaningfully cluster the decision trees, we introduce a new distance metric that takes into account both the decision rules as well as the predictions of a pair of decision trees. We also propose two new visualization methods that visualize both clustered and individual decision trees: (1) The Feature Plot, which visualizes the topological position of features in the decision trees, and (2) the Rule Plot, which visualizes the decision rules of the decision trees. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a case study on the "Glass" dataset, which is a relatively complex standard machine learning dataset, as well as a small user study.

Summary:<br />
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are engineered to target tumor cells by binding to specific antigens, with activation and proliferation regulated by co-stimulatory domains. The vast combinatorial space of possible CAR T-cell constructs poses challenges in experimental testing. A quantum approach, using Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) on a gate-based quantum computer, offers a solution by embedding classical data into a high-dimensional Hilbert space. This approach demonstrates enhanced classification performance for predicting CAR T cytotoxicity, particularly in areas with lesser available information. The study showcases the potential of quantum computing in addressing data-constrained problems and improving learning outcomes for specific signaling domains and domain positions within CAR T-cell constructs. <div>
arXiv:2507.22710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are T-cells engineered to recognize and kill specific tumor cells. Through their extracellular domains, CAR T-cells bind tumor cell antigens which triggers CAR T activation and proliferation. These processes are regulated by co-stimulatory domains present in the intracellular region of the CAR T-cell. Through integrating novel signaling components into the co-stimulatory domains, it is possible to modify CAR T-cell phenotype. Identifying and experimentally testing new CAR constructs based on libraries of co-stimulatory domains is nontrivial given the vast combinatorial space defined by such libraries. This leads to a highly data constrained, poorly explored combinatorial problem, where the experiments undersample all possible combinations. We propose a quantum approach using a Projected Quantum Kernel (PQK) to address this challenge. PQK operates by embedding classical data into a high dimensional Hilbert space and employs a kernel method to measure sample similarity. Using 61 qubits on a gate-based quantum computer, we demonstrate the largest PQK application to date and an enhancement in the classification performance over purely classical machine learning methods for CAR T cytotoxicity prediction. Importantly, we show improved learning for specific signaling domains and domain positions, particularly where there was lower information highlighting the potential for quantum computing in data-constrained problems.

Summary: <br />
Sensor-based sorting systems are essential for separating material streams efficiently. This paper presents an approach to continuously optimize, monitor, and adjust the process parameters of such systems. By utilizing Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian process regression models, specific system behavior requirements can be met while considering uncertainties. This approach minimizes the number of experiments needed and takes into account uncertainties in sorting accuracies. Two optimization targets based on material output streams are considered. The method was evaluated with three example process parameters, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving accurate and efficient sorting in sensor-based sorting systems. <div>
arXiv:2507.22766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

<div> Keywords: neural network distillation, interpretable AI, Jacobian-based regularizer, regression benchmarks, predictive accuracy

Summary:
In this work, the focus is on distilling large neural networks into simpler and more interpretable symbolic formulas. The existing process of distillation often results in low-fidelity student models due to the complexity of functions learned by standard networks. A novel training paradigm is proposed, involving a Jacobian-based regularizer to actively encourage the teacher network to learn smoother and more amenable functions for distillation. Extensive experiments on real-world regression benchmarks show the effectiveness of this method. By optimizing the regularization strength for each problem, a significant improvement in the fidelity of the distilled symbolic model is achieved, with a 120% increase in R^2 score relative to standard distillation, while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. This work offers a practical and principled approach to enhancing the fidelity of interpretable models derived from complex neural networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilling large neural networks into simple, human-readable symbolic formulas is a promising path toward trustworthy and interpretable AI. However, this process is often brittle, as the complex functions learned by standard networks are poor targets for symbolic discovery, resulting in low-fidelity student models. In this work, we propose a novel training paradigm to address this challenge. Instead of passively distilling a pre-trained network, we introduce a \textbf{Jacobian-based regularizer} that actively encourages the ``teacher'' network to learn functions that are not only accurate but also inherently smoother and more amenable to distillation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on a suite of real-world regression benchmarks that our method is highly effective. By optimizing the regularization strength for each problem, we improve the $R^2$ score of the final distilled symbolic model by an average of \textbf{120\% (relative)} compared to the standard distillation pipeline, all while maintaining the teacher's predictive accuracy. Our work presents a practical and principled method for significantly improving the fidelity of interpretable models extracted from complex neural networks.

Summary:
The study focuses on performance monitoring of image classification models in a clinical setting where ground-truth labels are often unavailable. The research introduces new methods to estimate the full confusion matrix, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of model performance. These methods were tested on chest x-ray data under real-world distribution shifts and simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The results showed promising outcomes in predicting clinically relevant counting metrics. However, the study also highlighted limitations and failure modes of current performance estimation techniques, especially in simulated shift scenarios. The findings underscore the need for a better understanding of real-world deployment contexts to effectively implement performance monitoring techniques for postmarket surveillance of medical AI models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.22776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performance monitoring is essential for safe clinical deployment of image classification models. However, because ground-truth labels are typically unavailable in the target dataset, direct assessment of real-world model performance is infeasible. State-of-the-art performance estimation methods address this by leveraging confidence scores to estimate the target accuracy. Despite being a promising direction, the established methods mainly estimate the model's accuracy and are rarely evaluated in a clinical domain, where strong class imbalances and dataset shifts are common. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce generalisations of existing performance prediction methods that directly estimate the full confusion matrix. Then, we benchmark their performance on chest x-ray data in real-world distribution shifts as well as simulated covariate and prevalence shifts. The proposed confusion matrix estimation methods reliably predicted clinically relevant counting metrics on medical images under distribution shifts. However, our simulated shift scenarios exposed important failure modes of current performance estimation techniques, calling for a better understanding of real-world deployment contexts when implementing these performance monitoring techniques for postmarket surveillance of medical AI models.

Summary: <br />
Density operators, essential in quantum computing, are now being used in machine learning for generative modeling. Traditional training algorithms for density operator models (DOMs) struggle with real-world datasets like MNIST. To address this, an Expectation-Maximization framework was developed to train latent variable models based on DOMs using classical hardware efficiently. The formulation of the Expectation step as a quantum information projection problem led to the creation of the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm, ensuring non-decreasing log-likelihood in model optimization. The algorithm was successfully applied to Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (QiDBMs), yielding impressive results in image generation on the MNIST dataset with a significant reduction in the Fréchet Inception Distance compared to classical DBMs. <div>
arXiv:2507.22786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density operators, quantum generalizations of probability distributions, are gaining prominence in machine learning due to their foundational role in quantum computing. Generative modeling based on density operator models (\textbf{DOMs}) is an emerging field, but existing training algorithms -- such as those for the Quantum Boltzmann Machine -- do not scale to real-world data, such as the MNIST dataset. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm has played a fundamental role in enabling scalable training of probabilistic latent variable models on real-world datasets. \textit{In this paper, we develop an Expectation-Maximization framework to learn latent variable models defined through \textbf{DOMs} on classical hardware, with resources comparable to those used for probabilistic models, while scaling to real-world data.} However, designing such an algorithm is nontrivial due to the absence of a well-defined quantum analogue to conditional probability, which complicates the Expectation step. To overcome this, we reformulate the Expectation step as a quantum information projection (QIP) problem and show that the Petz Recovery Map provides a solution under sufficient conditions. Using this formulation, we introduce the Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM) algorithm -- an iterative Minorant-Maximization procedure that optimizes a quantum evidence lower bound. We show that the \textbf{DO-EM} algorithm ensures non-decreasing log-likelihood across iterations for a broad class of models. Finally, we present Quantum Interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines (\textbf{QiDBMs}), a \textbf{DOM} that can be trained with the same resources as a DBM. When trained with \textbf{DO-EM} under Contrastive Divergence, a \textbf{QiDBM} outperforms larger classical DBMs in image generation on the MNIST dataset, achieving a 40--60\% reduction in the Fr\'echet Inception Distance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become an increasingly popular paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models. While existing RLHF training systems have enabled significant progress, they often face challenges in scaling to multi-modal and diffusion workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current approaches may encounter limitations in controller scalability, flexible resource placement, and efficient orchestration when handling complex RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios involving dynamic sampling or generative reward modeling. In this paper, we present \textbf{G-Core}, a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework designed to address these challenges. G-Core introduces a parallel controller programming model, enabling flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows without the bottlenecks of a single centralized controller. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions resources and schedules workloads, significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving utilization, even under highly variable training conditions. G-Core has successfully trained models that support WeChat product features serving a large-scale user base, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that G-Core advances the state of the art in RLHF training, providing a solid foundation for future research and deployment of large-scale, human-aligned models.

Abstract: We present a foundation model-derived method to identify highly informative tokens and events in electronic health records. Our approach considers incoming data in the entire context of a patient's hospitalization and so can flag anomalous events that rule-based approaches would consider within a normal range. We demonstrate that the events our model flags are significant for predicting downstream patient outcomes and that a fraction of events identified as carrying little information can safely be dropped. Additionally, we show how informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained on foundation model-derived representations.

Abstract: In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients (called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.

Abstract: Accurate quality prediction in multi-process manufacturing is critical for industrial efficiency but hindered by three core challenges: time-lagged process interactions, overlapping operations with mixed periodicity, and inter-process dependencies in shared frequency bands. To address these, we propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority. It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88% lower MAE. Our code is available at https://github.com/StevenLuan904/PAF-Net-Official.

arXiv:2507.22844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central goal in AI. However, dominant training paradigms face a critical limitation: reinforcement learning (RL) methods that optimize solely for final task success often reinforce flawed or inefficient reasoning paths, a problem we term inefficient exploration. This leads to agents that are brittle and fail to generalize, as they learn to find solutions without learning how to reason coherently. To address this, we introduce RLVMR, a novel framework that integrates dense, process-level supervision into end-to-end RL by rewarding verifiable, meta-reasoning behaviors. RLVMR equips an agent to explicitly tag its cognitive steps, such as planning, exploration, and reflection, and provides programmatic, rule-based rewards for actions that contribute to effective problem-solving. These process-centric rewards are combined with the final outcome signal and optimized using a critic-free policy gradient method. On the challenging ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks, RLVMR achieves new state-of-the-art results, with our 7B model reaching an 83.6% success rate on the most difficult unseen task split. Our analysis confirms these gains stem from improved reasoning quality, including significant reductions in redundant actions and enhanced error recovery, leading to more robust, efficient, and interpretable agents.

arXiv:2507.22849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Decentralized Differentially Private Power Method (D-DP-PM) for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in networked multi-agent settings. Unlike conventional decentralized PCA approaches where each agent accesses the full n-dimensional sample space, we address the challenging scenario where each agent observes only a subset of dimensions through row-wise data partitioning. Our method ensures $(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy (DP) while enabling collaborative estimation of global eigenvectors across the network without requiring a central aggregator. We achieve this by having agents share only local embeddings of the current eigenvector iterate, leveraging both the inherent privacy from random initialization and carefully calibrated Gaussian noise additions. We prove that our algorithm satisfies the prescribed $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee and establish convergence rates that explicitly characterize the impact of the network topology. Our theoretical analysis, based on linear dynamics and high-dimensional probability theory, provides tight bounds on both privacy and utility. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that D-DP-PM achieves superior privacy-utility tradeoffs compared to naive local DP approaches, with particularly strong performance in moderate privacy regimes ($\epsilon\in[2, 5]$). The method converges rapidly, allowing practitioners to trade iterations for enhanced privacy while maintaining competitive utility.

Abstract: We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a widely adopted approach which enables agents to learn from human expert demonstrations by framing the task as a supervised learning problem. However, IL often suffers from causal confusion, where agents misinterpret spurious correlations as causal relationships, leading to poor performance in testing environments with distribution shift. To address this issue, we introduce GAze-Based Regularization in Imitation Learning (GABRIL), a novel method that leverages the human gaze data gathered during the data collection phase to guide the representation learning in IL. GABRIL utilizes a regularization loss which encourages the model to focus on causally relevant features identified through expert gaze and consequently mitigates the effects of confounding variables. We validate our approach in Atari environments and the Bench2Drive benchmark in CARLA by collecting human gaze datasets and applying our method in both domains. Experimental results show that the improvement of GABRIL over behavior cloning is around 179% more than the same number for other baselines in the Atari and 76% in the CARLA setup. Finally, we show that our method provides extra explainability when compared to regular IL agents.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals offer a promising avenue for developing innovative human-computer interfaces by providing insights into muscular activity. However, the limited volume of training data and computational constraints during deployment have restricted the investigation of scaling up the model size for solving sEMG tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that vanilla transformer models can be effectively scaled up on sEMG data and yield improved cross-user performance up to 110M parameters, surpassing the model size regime investigated in other sEMG research (usually <10M parameters). We show that >100M-parameter models can be effectively distilled into models 50x smaller with minimal loss of performance (<1.5% absolute). This results in efficient and expressive models suitable for complex real-time sEMG tasks in real-world environments.

Abstract: In this paper we consider posterior Bayesian fully connected and feedforward deep neural networks with dependent weights. Particularly, if the likelihood is Gaussian, we identify the distribution of the wide width limit and provide an algorithm to sample from the network. In the shallow case we explicitly compute the distribution of the output, proving that it is a Gaussian mixture. All the theoretical results are numerically validated.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to follow maliciously crafted instructions to generate deceptive responses, posing safety challenges. How deceptive instructions alter the internal representations of LLM compared to truthful ones remains poorly understood beyond output analysis. To bridge this gap, we investigate when and how these representations ``flip'', such as from truthful to deceptive, under deceptive versus truthful/neutral instructions. Analyzing the internal representations of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct on a factual verification task, we find the model's instructed True/False output is predictable via linear probes across all conditions based on the internal representation. Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM detection and control. Our findings expose feature- and layer-level signatures of deception, offering new insights for detecting and mitigating instructed dishonesty in LLMs.

<title>Stacked SVD or SVD stacked? A Random Matrix Theory perspective on data integration</title>

Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires identifying shared latent structure across multiple high-dimensional datasets. A commonly used model assumes that the data matrices are noisy observations of low-rank matrices with a shared singular subspace. In this case, two primary methods have emerged for estimating this shared structure, which vary in how they integrate information across datasets. The first approach, termed Stack-SVD, concatenates all the datasets, and then performs a singular value decomposition (SVD). The second approach, termed SVD-Stack, first performs an SVD separately for each dataset, then aggregates the top singular vectors across these datasets, and finally computes a consensus amongst them. While these methods are widely used, they have not been rigorously studied in the proportional asymptotic regime, which is of great practical relevance in today's world of increasing data size and dimensionality. This lack of theoretical understanding has led to uncertainty about which method to choose and limited the ability to fully exploit their potential. To address these challenges, we derive exact expressions for the asymptotic performance and phase transitions of these two methods and develop optimal weighting schemes to further improve both methods. Our analysis reveals that while neither method uniformly dominates the other in the unweighted case, optimally weighted Stack-SVD dominates optimally weighted SVD-Stack. We extend our analysis to accommodate multiple shared components, and provide practical algorithms for estimating optimal weights from data, offering theoretical guidance for method selection in practical data integration problems. Extensive numerical simulations and semi-synthetic experiments on genomic data corroborate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for estimating Verb Frame Frequencies (VFFs), the frequency with which a verb appears in particular syntactic frames. VFFs provide a powerful window into syntax in both human and machine language systems, but existing tools for calculating them are limited in scale, accuracy, or accessibility. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate a corpus of sentences containing 476 English verbs. Next, by instructing an LLM to behave like an expert linguist, we had it analyze the syntactic structure of the sentences in this corpus. This pipeline outperforms two widely used syntactic parsers across multiple evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it requires far fewer resources than manual parsing (the gold-standard), thereby enabling rapid, scalable VFF estimation. Using the LLM parser, we produce a new VFF database with broader verb coverage, finer-grained syntactic distinctions, and explicit estimates of the relative frequencies of structural alternates commonly studied in psycholinguistics. The pipeline is easily customizable and extensible to new verbs, syntactic frames, and even other languages. We present this work as a proof of concept for automated frame frequency estimation, and release all code and data to support future research.

<title>Better Together: Cross and Joint Covariances Enhance Signal Detectability in Undersampled Data</title>

Abstract: Many data-science applications involve detecting a shared signal between two high-dimensional variables. Using random matrix theory methods, we determine when such signal can be detected and reconstructed from sample correlations, despite the background of sampling noise induced correlations. We consider three different covariance matrices constructed from two high-dimensional variables: their individual self covariance, their cross covariance, and the self covariance of the concatenated (joint) variable, which incorporates the self and the cross correlation blocks. We observe the expected Baik, Ben Arous, and P\'ech\'e detectability phase transition in all these covariance matrices, and we show that joint and cross covariance matrices always reconstruct the shared signal earlier than the self covariances. Whether the joint or the cross approach is better depends on the mismatch of dimensionalities between the variables. We discuss what these observations mean for choosing the right method for detecting linear correlations in data and how these findings may generalize to nonlinear statistical dependencies.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling buyer intent is a foundational challenge in optimizing search query reformulation within the dynamic landscape of e-commerce search systems. This work introduces a robust data pipeline designed to mine and analyze large-scale buyer query logs, with a focus on extracting fine-grained intent signals from both explicit interactions and implicit behavioral cues. Leveraging advanced sequence mining techniques and supervised learning models, the pipeline systematically captures patterns indicative of latent purchase intent, enabling the construction of a high-fidelity, intent-rich dataset. The proposed framework facilitates the development of adaptive query rewrite strategies by grounding reformulations in inferred user intent rather than surface-level lexical signals. This alignment between query rewriting and underlying user objectives enhances both retrieval relevance and downstream engagement metrics. Empirical evaluations across multiple product verticals demonstrate measurable gains in precision-oriented relevance metrics, underscoring the efficacy of intent-aware reformulation. Our findings highlight the value of intent-centric modeling in bridging the gap between sparse user inputs and complex product discovery goals, and establish a scalable foundation for future research in user-aligned neural retrieval and ranking systems.

<title>Representation biases: will we achieve complete understanding by analyzing representations?</title>

Abstract: A common approach in neuroscience is to study neural representations as a means to understand a system -- increasingly, by relating the neural representations to the internal representations learned by computational models. However, a recent work in machine learning (Lampinen, 2024) shows that learned feature representations may be biased to over-represent certain features, and represent others more weakly and less-consistently. For example, simple (linear) features may be more strongly and more consistently represented than complex (highly nonlinear) features. These biases could pose challenges for achieving full understanding of a system through representational analysis. In this perspective, we illustrate these challenges -- showing how feature representation biases can lead to strongly biased inferences from common analyses like PCA, regression, and RSA. We also present homomorphic encryption as a simple case study of the potential for strong dissociation between patterns of representation and computation. We discuss the implications of these results for representational comparisons between systems, and for neuroscience more generally.

<title>Understanding Concept Drift with Deprecated Permissions in Android Malware Detection</title>

Abstract: Permission analysis is a widely used method for Android malware detection. It involves examining the permissions requested by an application to access sensitive data or perform potentially malicious actions. In recent years, various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to Android malware detection using permission-based features and feature selection techniques, often achieving high accuracy. However, these studies have largely overlooked important factors such as protection levels and the deprecation or restriction of permissions due to updates in the Android OS -- factors that can contribute to concept drift.
  In this study, we investigate the impact of deprecated and restricted permissions on the performance of machine learning models. A large dataset containing 166 permissions was used, encompassing more than 70,000 malware and benign applications. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were employed as classifiers, along with different concept drift detection strategies. The results suggest that Android permissions are highly effective features for malware detection, with the exclusion of deprecated and restricted permissions having only a marginal impact on model performance. In some cases, such as with CNN, accuracy improved. Excluding these permissions also enhanced the detection of concept drift using a year-to-year analysis strategy. Dataset balancing further improved model performance, reduced low-accuracy instances, and enhanced concept drift detection via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Abstract: The analysis of fundus images is critical for the early detection and diagnosis of retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma, and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Traditional diagnostic workflows, however, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and resource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and interpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature extraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration of handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep convolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our model to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features from retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark datasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for Glaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates consistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for binary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the IC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\% accuracy, 94.8\% precision, and 94.5 AUC, outperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA, our model achieves 83.9\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive performance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive appendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features. The model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results position HOG-CNN as a robust and scalable tool for automated retinal disease screening.

Abstract: Intent recognition is a fundamental component in task-oriented dialogue systems (TODS). Determining user intents and detecting whether an intent is Out-of-Scope (OOS) is crucial for TODS to provide reliable responses. However, traditional TODS require large amount of annotated data. In this work we propose a hybrid approach to combine BERT and LLMs in zero and few-shot settings to recognize intents and detect OOS utterances. Our approach leverages LLMs generalization power and BERT's computational efficiency in such scenarios. We evaluate our method on multi-party conversation corpora and observe that sharing information from BERT outputs to LLMs leads to system performance improvement.

Abstract: Unprecedented volumes of Earth observation data are continually collected around the world, but high-quality labels remain scarce given the effort required to make physical measurements and observations. This has led to considerable investment in bespoke modeling efforts translating sparse labels into maps. Here we introduce AlphaEarth Foundations, an embedding field model yielding a highly general, geospatial representation that assimilates spatial, temporal, and measurement contexts across multiple sources, enabling accurate and efficient production of maps and monitoring systems from local to global scales. The embeddings generated by AlphaEarth Foundations are the only to consistently outperform all previous featurization approaches tested on a diverse set of mapping evaluations without re-training. We will release a dataset of global, annual, analysis-ready embedding field layers from 2017 through 2024.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonconvex decentralised optimisation and learning over a network of distributed agents. We develop an ADMM algorithm based on the Randomised Block Coordinate Douglas-Rachford splitting method which enables agents in the network to distributedly and asynchronously compute a set of first-order stationary solutions of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decentralised and asynchronous algorithm for solving nonconvex optimisation problems with convergence proof. The numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for distributed Phase Retrieval and sparse Principal Component Analysis problems.

Abstract: Depression and suicidality profoundly impact cognition and emotion, yet objective neurophysiological biomarkers remain elusive. We investigated the spatiotemporal neural dynamics underlying affective semantic processing in individuals with varying levels of clinical severity of depression and suicidality using multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Participants (N=137) completed a sentence evaluation task involving emotionally charged self-referential statements while EEG was recorded. We identified robust, neural signatures of semantic processing, with peak decoding accuracy between 300-600 ms -- a window associated with automatic semantic evaluation and conflict monitoring. Compared to healthy controls, individuals with depression and suicidality showed earlier onset, longer duration, and greater amplitude decoding responses, along with broader cross-temporal generalization and increased activation of frontocentral and parietotemporal components. These findings suggest altered sensitivity and impaired disengagement from emotionally salient content in the clinical groups, advancing our understanding of the neurocognitive basis of mental health and providing a principled basis for developing reliable EEG-based biomarkers of depression and suicidality.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are emerging as key components of 6G networks, with many already deployed to support large-scale Earth observation and sensing related tasks. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising paradigm for enabling distributed intelligence in these resource-constrained and dynamic environments. However, achieving reliable convergence, while minimizing both processing time and energy consumption, remains a substantial challenge, particularly in heterogeneous and partially unlabeled satellite networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel semi-supervised federated learning framework tailored for LEO satellite networks with hierarchical clustering aggregation. To further reduce communication overhead, we integrate sparsification and adaptive weight quantization techniques. In addition, we divide the FL clustering into two stages: satellite cluster aggregation stage and Ground Stations (GSs) aggregation stage. The supervised learning at GSs guides selected Parameter Server (PS) satellites, which in turn support fully unlabeled satellites during the federated training process. Extensive experiments conducted on a satellite network testbed demonstrate that our proposal can significantly reduce processing time (up to 3x) and energy consumption (up to 4x) compared to other comparative methods while maintaining model accuracy.

Abstract: State-space models are pivotal for dynamic system analysis but often struggle with outlier data that deviates from Gaussian distributions, frequently exhibiting skewness and heavy tails. This paper introduces a robust extension utilizing the asymmetric Laplace distribution, specifically tailored to capture these complex characteristics. We propose an efficient variational Bayes algorithm and a novel single-loop parameter estimation strategy, significantly enhancing the efficiency of the filtering, smoothing, and parameter estimation processes. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our methods provide consistently robust performance across various noise settings without the need for manual hyperparameter adjustments. In stark contrast, existing models generally rely on specific noise conditions and necessitate extensive manual tuning. Moreover, our approach uses far fewer computational resources, thereby validating the model's effectiveness and underscoring its potential for practical applications in fields such as robust control and financial modeling.

Abstract: Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy. Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco, and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.

Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods -- a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using several semi-analytical and numerical examples.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative approaches in several important fields. This paper aims for a paradigm shift for patent writing by leveraging LLMs to overcome the tedious patent-filing process. In this work, we present PATENTWRITER, the first unified benchmarking framework for evaluating LLMs in patent abstract generation. Given the first claim of a patent, we evaluate six leading LLMs -- including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 -- under a consistent setup spanning zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies to generate the abstract of the patent. Our benchmark PATENTWRITER goes beyond surface-level evaluation: we systematically assess the output quality using a comprehensive suite of metrics -- standard NLP measures (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore), robustness under three types of input perturbations, and applicability in two downstream patent classification and retrieval tasks. We also conduct stylistic analysis to assess length, readability, and tone. Experimental results show that modern LLMs can generate high-fidelity and stylistically appropriate patent abstracts, often surpassing domain-specific baselines. Our code and dataset are open-sourced to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with contextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social situation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of predicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event level emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer and S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group members, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing multi-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions primarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end, we extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic analysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims to predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and arousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our benchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses holistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on VGAF-GEMS benchmarking. We believe that it will pave the way of further research. The code and data is available at: https://github.com/katariaak579/GEMS

Abstract: Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown significant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in image reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is often strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can degrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations, we introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that synergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR learns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and generalizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain scenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model complexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning applications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to existing frameworks.

<title>Comparing Normalizing Flows with Kernel Density Estimation in Estimating Risk of Automated Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach, where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS, comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality. As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.

<title>Breaking Obfuscation: Cluster-Aware Graph with LLM-Aided Recovery for Malicious JavaScript Detection</title>

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of web-based applications and cloud services, malicious JavaScript code continues to pose significant threats to user privacy, system integrity, and enterprise security. But, detecting such threats remains challenging due to sophisticated code obfuscation techniques and JavaScript's inherent language characteristics, particularly its nested closure structures and syntactic flexibility. In this work, we propose DeCoda, a hybrid defense framework that combines large language model (LLM)-based deobfuscation with code graph learning: (1) We first construct a sophisticated prompt-learning pipeline with multi-stage refinement, where the LLM progressively reconstructs the original code structure from obfuscated inputs and then generates normalized Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations; (2) In JavaScript ASTs, dynamic typing scatters semantically similar nodes while deeply nested functions fracture scope capturing, introducing structural noise and semantic ambiguity. To address these challenges, we then propose to learn hierarchical code graph representations via a Cluster-wise Graph that synergistically integrates graph transformer network, node clustering, and node-to-cluster attention to simultaneously capture both local node-level semantics and global cluster-induced structural relationships from AST graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves F1-scores of 94.64% and 97.71% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating absolute improvements of 10.74% and 13.85% over state-of-the-art baselines. In false-positive control evaluation at fixed FPR levels (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01), our approach delivers 4.82, 5.91, and 2.53 higher TPR respectively compared to the best-performing baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-based deobfuscation and underscore the importance of modeling cluster-level relationships in detecting malicious code.

Abstract: The contemporary phenomenon of deepfakes, utilizing GAN or diffusion models for face swapping, presents a substantial and evolving threat in digital media, identity verification, and a multitude of other systems. The majority of existing methods for detecting deepfakes rely on training specialized classifiers to distinguish between genuine and manipulated images, focusing only on the image domain without incorporating any auxiliary tasks that could enhance robustness. In this paper, inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of Vision Language Models, we propose a novel VLM-based approach to image classification and then evaluate it for deepfake detection. Specifically, we utilize a new high-quality deepfake dataset comprising 60,000 images, on which our zero-shot models demonstrate superior performance to almost all existing methods. Subsequently, we compare the performance of the best-performing architecture, InstructBLIP, on the popular deepfake dataset DFDC-P against traditional methods in two scenarios: zero-shot and in-domain fine-tuning. Our results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over traditional classifiers.

<title>LVM-GP: Uncertainty-Aware PDE Solver via coupling latent variable model and Gaussian process</title>

arXiv:2507.22493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework, termed LVM-GP, for uncertainty quantification in solving forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy data. The core idea is to construct a stochastic mapping from the input to a high-dimensional latent representation, enabling uncertainty-aware prediction of the solution. Specifically, the architecture consists of a confidence-aware encoder and a probabilistic decoder. The encoder implements a high-dimensional latent variable model based on a Gaussian process (LVM-GP), where the latent representation is constructed by interpolating between a learnable deterministic feature and a Gaussian process prior, with the interpolation strength adaptively controlled by a confidence function learned from data. The decoder defines a conditional Gaussian distribution over the solution field, where the mean is predicted by a neural operator applied to the latent representation, allowing the model to learn flexible function-to-function mapping. Moreover, physical laws are enforced as soft constraints in the loss function to ensure consistency with the underlying PDE structure. Compared to existing approaches such as Bayesian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) and deep ensembles, the proposed framework can efficiently capture functional dependencies via merging a latent Gaussian process and neural operator, resulting in competitive predictive accuracy and robust uncertainty quantification. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the method.

<title>A surrogate model for topology optimisation of elastic structures via parametric autoencoders</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics. Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning provides a rehearsal-free solution by tuning small sets of parameters while keeping pre-trained models frozen. To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models. CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel interdisciplinary perspective by bridging cognitive science and LLM safety, paving the way for more robust and human-aligned AI systems.

<title>COOkeD: Ensemble-based OOD detection in the era of zero-shot CLIP</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier, leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier. We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: The canonical theory of sublinear expectations, a foundation of stochastic calculus under ambiguity, is insensitive to the non-convex geometry of primitive uncertainty models. This paper develops a new stochastic calculus for a structured class of such non-convex models. We introduce a class of fully coupled Mean-Field Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations where the BSDE driver is defined by a pointwise maximization over a law-dependent, non-convex set. Mathematical tractability is achieved via a uniform strong concavity assumption on the driver with respect to the control variable, which ensures the optimization admits a unique and stable solution. A central contribution is to establish the Lipschitz stability of this optimizer from primitive geometric and regularity conditions, which underpins the entire well-posedness theory. We prove local and global well-posedness theorems for the FBSDE system. The resulting valuation functional, the $\Theta$-Expectation, is shown to be dynamically consistent and, most critically, to violate the axiom of sub-additivity. This, along with its failure to be translation invariant, demonstrates its fundamental departure from the convex paradigm. This work provides a rigorous foundation for stochastic calculus under a class of non-convex, endogenous ambiguity.

Abstract: Language-specific neurons in LLMs that strongly correlate with individual languages have been shown to influence model behavior by deactivating them. However, their role in amplification remains underexplored. This work investigates the effect of amplifying language-specific neurons through interventions across 18 languages, including low-resource ones, using three models primarily trained in different languages. We compare amplification factors by their effectiveness in steering to the target language using a proposed Language Steering Shift (LSS) evaluation score, then evaluate it on downstream tasks: commonsense reasoning (XCOPA, XWinograd), knowledge (Include), and translation (FLORES). The optimal amplification factors effectively steer output toward nearly all tested languages. Intervention using this factor on downstream tasks improves self-language performance in some cases but generally degrades cross-language results. These findings highlight the effect of language-specific neurons in multilingual behavior, where amplification can be beneficial especially for low-resource languages, but provides limited advantage for cross-lingual transfer.

Abstract: Domain adaptation seeks to leverage the abundant label information in a source domain to improve classification performance in a target domain with limited labels. While the field has seen extensive methodological development, its theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. Most existing theoretical analyses focus on simplified settings where the source and target domains share the same input space and relate target-domain performance to measures of domain discrepancy. Although insightful, these analyses may not fully capture the behavior of modern approaches that align domains into a shared space via feature transformations. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of domain adaptation algorithms based on domain alignment. We consider the joint learning of domain-aligning feature transformations and a shared classifier in a semi-supervised setting. We first derive generalization bounds in a broad setting, in terms of covering numbers of the relevant function classes. We then extend our analysis to characterize the sample complexity of domain-adaptive neural networks employing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) or adversarial objectives. Our results rely on a rigorous analysis of the covering numbers of these architectures. We show that, for both MMD-based and adversarial models, the sample complexity admits an upper bound that scales quadratically with network depth and width. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that in semi-supervised settings, robustness to limited labeled target data can be achieved by scaling the target loss proportionally to the square root of the number of labeled target samples. Experimental evaluation in both shallow and deep settings lends support to our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within the biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms, highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models. The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in financial problem-solving have leveraged LLMs and agent-based systems, with a primary focus on trading and financial modeling. However, credit assessment remains an underexplored challenge, traditionally dependent on rule-based methods and statistical models. In this paper, we introduce MASCA, an LLM-driven multi-agent system designed to enhance credit evaluation by mirroring real-world decision-making processes. The framework employs a layered architecture where specialized LLM-based agents collaboratively tackle sub-tasks. Additionally, we integrate contrastive learning for risk and reward assessment to optimize decision-making. We further present a signaling game theory perspective on hierarchical multi-agent systems, offering theoretical insights into their structure and interactions. Our paper also includes a detailed bias analysis in credit assessment, addressing fairness concerns. Experimental results demonstrate that MASCA outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent systems in financial applications, particularly in credit scoring.

Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing, actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions, and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.

Abstract: Despite outstanding results, machine learning-based Android malware detection models struggle with concept drift, where rapidly evolving malware characteristics degrade model effectiveness. This study examines the impact of concept drift on Android malware detection, evaluating two datasets and nine machine learning and deep learning algorithms, as well as Large Language Models (LLMs). Various feature types--static, dynamic, hybrid, semantic, and image-based--were considered. The results showed that concept drift is widespread and significantly affects model performance. Factors influencing the drift include feature types, data environments, and detection methods. Balancing algorithms helped with class imbalance but did not fully address concept drift, which primarily stems from the dynamic nature of the malware landscape. No strong link was found between the type of algorithm used and concept drift, the impact was relatively minor compared to other variables since hyperparameters were not fine-tuned, and the default algorithm configurations were used. While LLMs using few-shot learning demonstrated promising detection performance, they did not fully mitigate concept drift, highlighting the need for further investigation.

Abstract: This paper introduces Team-Attention-Actor-Critic (TAAC), a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to enhance multi-agent collaboration in cooperative environments. TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic. This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession swaps).

<title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We present a vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative memory model inspired by the theory of amorphous solids, where binary neural states are replaced by unit vectors $\mathbf{s}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ on the sphere $S^2$. The generalized Hebbian learning rule creates a block-structured weight matrix through outer products of stored pattern vectors, analogous to the Hessian matrix structure in amorphous solids. We demonstrate that this model exhibits quantifiable structural properties characteristic of disordered materials: energy landscapes with deep minima for stored patterns versus random configurations (energy gaps $\sim 7$ units), strongly anisotropic correlations encoded in the weight matrix (anisotropy ratios $\sim 10^2$), and order-disorder transitions controlled by the pattern density $\gamma = P/(N \cdot d)$. The enhanced memory capacity ($\gamma_c \approx 0.55$ for a fully-connected network) compared to binary networks ($\gamma_c \approx 0.138$) and the emergence of orientational correlations establish connections between associative memory mechanisms and amorphous solid physics, particularly in systems with continuous orientational degrees of freedom. We also unveil the scaling with the coordination number $Z$ of the memory capacity: $\gamma_c \sim (Z-6)$ from the isostatic point $Z_c =6$ of the 3D elastic network, which closely mirrors the scaling of the shear modulus $G \sim (Z-6)$ in 3D central-force spring networks.

<title>Subgrid BoostCNN: Efficient Boosting of Convolutional Networks via Gradient-Guided Feature Selection</title>

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of machine learning tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature learning through deep architectures. However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.

<title>Federated Learning on Riemannian Manifolds: A Gradient-Free Projection-Based Approach</title>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, existing FL algorithms predominantly focus on unconstrained optimization problems with exact gradient information, limiting its applicability in scenarios where only noisy function evaluations are accessible or where model parameters are constrained. To address these challenges, we propose a novel zeroth-order projection-based algorithm on Riemannian manifolds for FL. By leveraging the projection operator, we introduce a computationally efficient zeroth-order Riemannian gradient estimator. Unlike existing estimators, ours requires only a simple Euclidean random perturbation, eliminating the need to sample random vectors in the tangent space, thus reducing computational cost. Theoretically, we first prove the approximation properties of the estimator and then establish the sublinear convergence of the proposed algorithm, matching the rate of its first-order counterpart. Numerically, we first assess the efficiency of our estimator using kernel principal component analysis. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to two real-world scenarios: zeroth-order attacks on deep neural networks and low-rank neural network training to validate the theoretical findings.

<title>Synchronization of mean-field models on the circle</title>

Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global synchronization does not occur when $\beta < -2/3$.

<title>Mesh based segmentation for automated margin line generation on incisors receiving crown treatment</title>

Abstract: Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or missing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are carried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a preparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually define a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a non-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework to determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A dataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to train a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was modified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth into two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary faces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to train 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their results to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and optimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation results. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to represent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the centers of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that an ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest number of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance threshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground truth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the preparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth margin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide the train and test datasets for the community.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality, demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Machine and deep learning have grown in popularity and use in biological research over the last decade but still present challenges in interpretability of the fitted model. The development and use of metrics to determine features driving predictions and increase model interpretability continues to be an open area of research. We investigate the use of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) on a multi-view deep learning model applied to multi-omics data for the purposes of identifying biomolecules of interest. Rankings of features via these attribution methods are compared across various architectures to evaluate consistency of the method. We perform multiple computational experiments to assess the robustness of SHAP and investigate modeling approaches and diagnostics to increase and measure the reliability of the identification of important features. Accuracy of a random-forest model fit on subsets of features selected as being most influential as well as clustering quality using only these features are used as a measure of effectiveness of the attribution method. Our findings indicate that the rankings of features resulting from SHAP are sensitive to the choice of architecture as well as different random initializations of weights, suggesting caution when using attribution methods on multi-view deep learning models applied to multi-omics data. We present an alternative, simple method to assess the robustness of identification of important biomolecules.

Abstract: Graph representation learning in Euclidean space, despite its widespread adoption and proven utility in many domains, often struggles to effectively capture the inherent hierarchical and complex relational structures prevalent in real-world data, particularly for datasets exhibiting a highly non-Euclidean latent anatomy or power-law distributions. Hyperbolic geometry, with its constant negative curvature and exponential growth property, naturally accommodates such structures, offering a promising alternative for learning rich graph representations. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving field of Hyperbolic Graph Learning (HGL). We systematically categorize and analyze existing methods broadly dividing them into (1) hyperbolic graph embedding-based techniques, (2) graph neural network-based hyperbolic models, and (3) emerging paradigms. Beyond methodologies, we extensively discuss diverse applications of HGL across multiple domains, including recommender systems, knowledge graphs, bioinformatics, and other relevant scenarios, demonstrating the broad applicability and effectiveness of hyperbolic geometry in real-world graph learning tasks. Most importantly, we identify several key challenges that serve as directions for advancing HGL, including handling complex data structures, developing geometry-aware learning objectives, ensuring trustworthy and scalable implementations, and integrating with foundation models, e.g., large language models. We highlight promising research opportunities in this exciting interdisciplinary area. A comprehensive repository can be found at https://github.com/digailab/awesome-hyperbolic-graph-learning.

Abstract: This work in progress aims to provide a unified introduction to statistical learning, building up slowly from classical models like the GMM and HMM to modern neural networks like the VAE and diffusion models. There are today many internet resources that explain this or that new machine-learning algorithm in isolation, but they do not (and cannot, in so brief a space) connect these algorithms with each other or with the classical literature on statistical models, out of which the modern algorithms emerged. Also conspicuously lacking is a single notational system which, although unfazing to those already familiar with the material (like the authors of these posts), raises a significant barrier to the novice's entry. Likewise, I have aimed to assimilate the various models, wherever possible, to a single framework for inference and learning, showing how (and why) to change one model into another with minimal alteration (some of them novel, others from the literature).
  Some background is of course necessary. I have assumed the reader is familiar with basic multivariable calculus, probability and statistics, and linear algebra. The goal of this book is certainly not completeness, but rather to draw a more or less straight-line path from the basics to the extremely powerful new models of the last decade. The goal then is to complement, not replace, such comprehensive texts as Bishop's \emph{Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning}, which is now 15 years old.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of machine learning necessitates robust privacy protection alongside algorithmic resilience. While Local Differential Privacy (LDP) provides foundational guarantees, sophisticated adversaries with prior knowledge demand more nuanced Bayesian privacy notions, such as Maximum Bayesian Privacy (MBP) and Average Bayesian Privacy (ABP), first introduced by \cite{zhang2022no}. Concurrently, machine learning systems require inherent robustness against data perturbations and adversarial manipulations. This paper systematically investigates the intricate theoretical relationships among LDP, MBP, and ABP. Crucially, we bridge these privacy concepts with algorithmic robustness, particularly within the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework. Our work demonstrates that privacy-preserving mechanisms inherently confer PAC robustness. We present key theoretical results, including the formalization of the established LDP-MBP relationship, novel bounds between MBP and ABP, and a proof demonstrating PAC robustness from MBP. Furthermore, we establish a novel theoretical relationship quantifying how privacy leakage directly influences an algorithm's input robustness. These results provide a unified theoretical framework for understanding and optimizing the privacy-robustness trade-off, paving the way for the development of more secure, trustworthy, and resilient machine learning systems.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that 8-bit floating point (FP8) can be used for efficiently training neural networks with reduced computational cost compared to training in FP32/FP16. In this work, we investigate the use of FP8 training in a federated learning context. This approach brings not only the usual benefits of FP8 which are desirable for on-device training at the edge, but also reduces client-server communication costs due to significant weight compression. We present a novel method for combining FP8 client training while maintaining a global FP32 server model and provide convergence analysis. Experiments with various machine learning models and datasets show that our method consistently yields communication reductions of at least 2.9x across a variety of tasks and models compared to an FP32 baseline to achieve the same trained model accuracy.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare question answering requires robust methods to ensure accuracy and reliability. This work introduces Query-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation (QB-RAG), a framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in healthcare question-answering by pre-aligning user queries with a database of curated, answerable questions derived from healthcare content. A key component of QB-RAG is an LLM-based filtering mechanism that ensures that only relevant and answerable questions are included in the database, enabling reliable reference query generation at scale. We provide theoretical motivation for QB-RAG, conduct a comparative analysis of existing retrieval enhancement techniques, and introduce a generalizable, comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses both the retrieval effectiveness and the quality of the generated response based on faithfulness, relevance, and adherence to the guideline. Our empirical evaluation on a healthcare data set demonstrates the superior performance of QB-RAG compared to existing retrieval methods, highlighting its practical value in building trustworthy digital health applications for health question-answering.

Abstract: Federated learning is a promising approach for training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However, its distributed nature makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks, particularly in NLP tasks, where related research remains limited. This paper introduces SDBA, a novel backdoor attack mechanism designed for NLP tasks in federated learning environments. Through a systematic analysis across LSTM and GPT-2 models, we identify the most vulnerable layers for backdoor injection and achieve both stealth and long-lasting durability by applying layer-wise gradient masking and top-k% gradient masking. Also, to evaluate the task generalizability of SDBA, we additionally conduct experiments on the T5 model. Experiments on next-token prediction, sentiment analysis, and question answering tasks show that SDBA outperforms existing backdoors in terms of durability and effectively bypasses representative defense mechanisms, demonstrating notable performance in transformer-based models such as GPT-2. These results highlight the urgent need for robust defense strategies in NLP-based federated learning systems.

Abstract: Inferring dynamical models from data continues to be a significant challenge in computational biology, especially given the stochastic nature of many biological processes. We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ODE inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures.

Abstract: Echo state networks (ESNs) are a class of recurrent neural networks in which only the readout layer is trainable, while the recurrent and input layers are fixed. This architectural constraint enables computationally efficient processing of time-series data. Traditionally, the readout layer in ESNs is trained using supervised learning with target outputs. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), where the readout layer is trained to reconstruct the input time series fed into the ESN. We show that IR can be achieved through unsupervised learning (UL), without access to supervised targets, provided that the ESN parameters are known a priori and satisfy invertibility conditions. This formulation allows applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, to be reformulated within the UL framework via straightforward integration with existing algorithms. Our results suggest that prior knowledge of ESN parameters can reduce reliance on supervision, thereby establishing a new principle: not only by fixing part of the network parameters but also by exploiting their specific values. Furthermore, our UL-based algorithms for input reconstruction and related tasks are suitable for autonomous processing, offering insights into how analogous computational mechanisms might operate in the brain in principle. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of ESNs and their relevance to models in computational neuroscience.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series forecasting. While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose ELF to answer this question. ELF is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. ELF consists of two parts: a) the ELF-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the ELF-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the ELF-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of ELF in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using ELF improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a key machine learning technology driving progress across various scientific and engineering fields, including wireless communication. However, its limited interpretability and generalizability remain major challenges. In supervised learning, generalizability is commonly evaluated through the generalization error using information-theoretic methods. In DRL, the training data is sequential and not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), rendering traditional information-theoretic methods unsuitable for generalizability analysis. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel analytical method for evaluating the generalizability of DRL. Specifically, we first model the evolution of states and actions in trained DRL algorithms as unknown discrete, stochastic, and nonlinear dynamical functions. Then, we employ a data-driven identification method, the Koopman operator, to approximate these functions, and propose two interpretable representations. Based on these interpretable representations, we develop a rigorous mathematical approach to evaluate the generalizability of DRL algorithms. This approach is formulated using the spectral feature analysis of the Koopman operator, leveraging the H_\infty norm. Finally, we apply this generalization analysis to compare the soft actor-critic method, widely recognized as a robust DRL approach, against the proximal policy optimization algorithm for an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted mmWave wireless communication scenario.

Abstract: We present a challenging benchmark for the Open WorLd VISual question answering (OWLViz) task. OWLViz presents concise, unambiguous queries that require integrating multiple capabilities, including visual understanding, web exploration, and specialized tool usage. While humans achieve 69.2% accuracy on these intuitive tasks, even state-of-the-art VLMs struggle, with the best model, Gemini 2.0, achieving only 26.6% accuracy. Current agentic VLMs, which rely on limited vision and vision-language models as tools, perform even worse. This performance gap reveals significant limitations in multimodal systems' ability to select appropriate tools and execute complex reasoning sequences, establishing new directions for advancing practical AI research.

Abstract: State-space modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for sequence analysis in various tasks such as natural language processing, time-series forecasting, and signal processing. In this work, we propose an \emph{Adaptive State-Space Mamba} (\textbf{ASSM}) framework for real-time sensor data anomaly detection. While state-space models have been previously employed for image processing applications (e.g., style transfer \cite{wang2024stylemamba}), our approach leverages the core idea of sequential hidden states to tackle a significantly different domain: detecting anomalies on streaming sensor data.
  In particular, we introduce an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically modulates the hidden state update based on contextual and learned statistical cues. This design ensures that our model remains computationally efficient and scalable, even under rapid data arrival rates. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic sensor datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection performance compared to existing baselines. Our approach is easily extensible to other time-series tasks that demand rapid and reliable detection capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{uncertainty-aware graph self-training} approach for semi-supervised node classification. Our method introduces an Expectation-Maximization (EM) regularization scheme to incorporate an uncertainty mechanism during pseudo-label generation and model retraining. Unlike conventional graph self-training pipelines that rely on fixed pseudo-labels, our approach iteratively refines label confidences with an EM-inspired uncertainty measure. This ensures that the predictive model focuses on reliable graph regions while gradually incorporating ambiguous nodes. Inspired by prior work on uncertainty-aware self-training techniques~\cite{wang2024uncertainty}, our framework is designed to handle noisy graph structures and feature spaces more effectively. Through extensive experiments on several benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms strong baselines by a margin of up to 2.5\% in accuracy while maintaining lower variance in performance across multiple runs.

Abstract: Self-training has become a popular semi-supervised learning technique for leveraging unlabeled data. However, the over-confidence of pseudo-labels remains a key challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{graph-based uncertainty-aware self-training} (GUST) framework to combat over-confidence in node classification. Drawing inspiration from the uncertainty integration idea introduced by Wang \emph{et al.}~\cite{wang2024uncertainty}, our method largely diverges from previous self-training approaches by focusing on \emph{stochastic node labeling} grounded in the graph topology. Specifically, we deploy a Bayesian-inspired module to estimate node-level uncertainty, incorporate these estimates into the pseudo-label generation process via an expectation-maximization (EM)-like step, and iteratively update both node embeddings and adjacency-based transformations. Experimental results on several benchmark graph datasets demonstrate that our GUST framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings where labeled data is extremely sparse.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of prominent clustering algorithms K-means, DBSCAN, and Spectral Clustering on high-dimensional datasets. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that assesses clustering performance across multiple dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) using diverse quantitative metrics. Experiments conducted on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and UCI HAR datasets reveal that preprocessing with UMAP consistently improves clustering quality across all algorithms, with Spectral Clustering demonstrating superior performance on complex manifold structures. Our findings show that algorithm selection should be guided by data characteristics, with Kmeans excelling in computational efficiency, DBSCAN in handling irregular clusters, and Spectral Clustering in capturing complex relationships. This research contributes a systematic approach for evaluating and selecting clustering techniques for high dimensional data applications.

Abstract: Competitive Pok\'emon Singles (CPS) is a popular strategy game where players learn to exploit their opponent based on imperfect information in battles that can last more than one hundred stochastic turns. AI research in CPS has been led by heuristic tree search and online self-play, but the game may also create a platform to study adaptive policies trained offline on large datasets. We develop a pipeline to reconstruct the first-person perspective of an agent from logs saved from the third-person perspective of a spectator, thereby unlocking a dataset of real human battles spanning more than a decade that grows larger every day. This dataset enables a black-box approach where we train large sequence models to adapt to their opponent based solely on their input trajectory while selecting moves without explicit search of any kind. We study a progression from imitation learning to offline RL and offline fine-tuning on self-play data in the hardcore competitive setting of Pok\'emon's four oldest (and most partially observed) game generations. The resulting agents outperform a recent LLM Agent approach and a strong heuristic search engine. While playing anonymously in online battles against humans, our best agents climb to rankings inside the top 10% of active players. All agent checkpoints, training details, datasets, and baselines are available at https://metamon.tech.

<title>Enhancing Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models Through Saliency-Aware Partial Retraining</title>

Abstract: The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85% and 7.54% respectively. A Python implementation of the proposed quantization method is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/TokuyuSou/ULB-SAPR.

Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence plays a central role in probabilistic machine learning, where it commonly serves as the canonical loss function. Optimization in such settings is often performed over the probability simplex, where the choice of parameterization significantly impacts convergence. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the KL divergence and analyze the behavior of gradient-based optimization algorithms under two dual coordinate systems within the framework of information geometry$-$ the exponential family ($\theta$ coordinates) and the mixture family ($\eta$ coordinates). We compare Euclidean gradient descent (GD) in these coordinates with the coordinate-invariant natural gradient descent (NGD), where the natural gradient is a Riemannian gradient that incorporates the intrinsic geometry of the underlying statistical model. In continuous time, we prove that the convergence rates of GD in the $\theta$ and $\eta$ coordinates provide lower and upper bounds, respectively, on the convergence rate of NGD. Moreover, under affine reparameterizations of the dual coordinates, the convergence rates of GD in $\eta$ and $\theta$ coordinates can be scaled to $2c$ and $\frac{2}{c}$, respectively, for any $c>0$, while NGD maintains a fixed convergence rate of $2$, remaining invariant to such transformations and sandwiched between them. Although this suggests that NGD may not exhibit uniformly superior convergence in continuous time, we demonstrate that its advantages become pronounced in discrete time, where it achieves faster convergence and greater robustness to noise, outperforming GD. Our analysis hinges on bounding the spectrum and condition number of the Hessian of the KL divergence at the optimum, which coincides with the Fisher information matrix.

Abstract: We precisely characterize the expressivity of computable Recurrent Graph Neural Networks (recurrent GNNs). We prove that recurrent GNNs with finite-precision parameters, sum aggregation, and ReLU activation, can compute any graph algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the Color Refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI 2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually match this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where each graph size requires a different GNN to compute with. Our construction introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, for connected graphs recurrent GNNs can express all graph algorithms. In particular, any polynomial-time graph algorithm can be emulated on connected graphs in polynomial time by a recurrent GNN with random initialization.

Abstract: Mixture of expert (MoE) models are a promising approach to increasing model capacity without increasing inference cost, and are core components of many state-of-the-art language models. However, current MoE models typically use only few experts due to prohibitive training and inference cost. We propose Test-Time Model Merging (TTMM) which scales the MoE paradigm to an order of magnitude more experts and uses model merging to avoid almost any test-time overhead. We show that TTMM is an approximation of test-time training (TTT), which fine-tunes an expert model for each prediction task, i.e., prompt. TTT has recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is computationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more experts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B parameter base model, TTMM is more than 100x faster than TTT at test-time by amortizing the cost of TTT at train-time. Thus, TTMM offers a promising cost-effective approach to scale test-time training.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for ownership verification of deep neural network (DNN) models for image classification tasks. It allows verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has been an effective approach for improving Large Language Models' reasoning in domains such as coding and mathematics. Here, we apply RLVR methods towards forecasting future real-world events - a challenging task for RL due to the very noisy (and delayed) outcomes involved. Using a novel dataset of recent questions from a prediction market, and accompanying relevant news headlines, we show that a compact (14B) reasoning model can be trained to match or surpass the predictive accuracy of frontier models like o1, while greatly improving probabilistic calibration. The model's performance is also practically meaningful: in a Polymarket trading simulation, we estimate that its bets would have yielded a return on investment of over 10% across all questions in the test set. We detail and compare approaches used in training our model, including augmenting our training-data with synthetic prediction questions, guardrails for learning stability, and median prediction sampling at inference-time.

Abstract: Adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep learning models. For about a decade, countless attack and defense methods have been proposed, leading to robustified classifiers and better understanding of models. Among these methods, curvature-based approaches have attracted attention because it is assumed that high curvature may give rise to rough decision boundary. However, the most commonly used \textit{curvature} is the curvature of loss function, scores or other parameters from within the model as opposed to decision boundary curvature, since the former can be relatively easily formed using second order derivative. In this paper, we propose a new query-efficient method, dynamic curvature estimation(DCE), to estimate the decision boundary curvature in a black-box setting. Our approach is based on CGBA, a black-box adversarial attack. By performing DCE on a wide range of classifiers, we discovered, statistically, a connection between decision boundary curvature and adversarial robustness. We also propose a new attack method, curvature dynamic black-box attack(CDBA) with improved performance using the dynamically estimated curvature.

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.

Abstract: Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) is a flexible and effective variance reduction technique for accelerating reliability assessments of complex power system. Recently, data-driven surrogate models have been proposed as lower-level models in the MLMC framework due to their high correlation and negligible execution time once trained. However, in resource adequacy assessments, pre-labeled datasets are typically unavailable. For large-scale systems, the efficiency gains from surrogate models are often offset by the substantial time required for labeling training data. Therefore, this paper introduces a speed metric that accounts for training time in evaluating MLMC efficiency. Considering the total time budget is limited, a vote-by-committee active learning approach is proposed to reduce the required labeling calls. A case study demonstrates that, within a given computational budget, active learning in combination with MLMC can result in a substantial reduction variance.

Abstract: We present a formal and constructive simulation framework for nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) using standard feedforward ReLU neural networks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on recurrent architectures or post hoc extraction methods, our formulation symbolically encodes automaton states as binary vectors, transitions as sparse linear transformations, and nondeterministic branching - including {\epsilon}-closures - as compositions of shared ReLU layers. We prove that every regular language can be recognized exactly by a depth-unrolled ReLU network with shared parameters, independent of input length. Our construction yields not only formal equivalence between NFAs and ReLU networks, but also practical trainability: we demonstrate that the networks can learn NFA acceptance behavior through gradient descent using standard supervised data. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical results, achieving perfect or near-perfect agreement on acceptance, state propagation, and closure dynamics. This work establishes a new bridge between symbolic automata theory and modern neural architectures, showing that feedforward networks can perform precise, interpretable, and trainable symbolic computation.

Abstract: Being able to solve a task in diverse ways makes agents more robust to task variations and less prone to local optima. In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for identifying mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials without a closed-form constitutive equation. Given a full-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from digital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field is obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to effectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven method built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to discover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary materials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations by default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the input is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based constitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by minimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for violations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and the associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with several numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in material parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material identification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to experimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is robust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous materials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to classical inverse methods.

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) parameterized by an arbitrary time-dependent stochasticity parameter or a probability flow ODE, corresponding to the stochasticity parameter set to zero. In this work, we study the effect of this stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, complementing the analysis with numerical and analytical examples. Our main results apply to linear forward SDEs with additive noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

Abstract: We propose two new methods based/inspired by machine learning for tabular data and distance-free localization to enhance the covariance estimations in an ensemble data assimilation. The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods. Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.

<title>Floating-Point Neural Networks Are Provably Robust Universal Approximators</title>

Abstract: The classical universal approximation (UA) theorem for neural networks establishes mild conditions under which a feedforward neural network can approximate a continuous function $f$ with arbitrary accuracy. A recent result shows that neural networks also enjoy a more general interval universal approximation (IUA) theorem, in the sense that the abstract interpretation semantics of the network using the interval domain can approximate the direct image map of $f$ (i.e., the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs) with arbitrary accuracy. These theorems, however, rest on the unrealistic assumption that the neural network computes over infinitely precise real numbers, whereas their software implementations in practice compute over finite-precision floating-point numbers. An open question is whether the IUA theorem still holds in the floating-point setting.
  This paper introduces the first IUA theorem for floating-point neural networks that proves their remarkable ability to perfectly capture the direct image map of any rounded target function $f$, showing no limits exist on their expressiveness. Our IUA theorem in the floating-point setting exhibits material differences from the real-valued setting, which reflects the fundamental distinctions between these two computational models. This theorem also implies surprising corollaries, which include (i) the existence of provably robust floating-point neural networks; and (ii) the computational completeness of the class of straight-line programs that use only floating-point additions and multiplications for the class of all floating-point programs that halt.

Abstract: Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model. However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE) filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class), linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached 98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression. These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive ensembling with tractable complexity.

Abstract: Wildfires are increasing in intensity and severity at an alarming rate. Recent advances in AI and publicly available satellite data enable monitoring critical wildfire risk factors globally, at high resolution and low latency. Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical wildfire risk factor and is valuable for both wildfire research and operational response. However, ground-based LFMC samples are both labor intensive and costly to acquire, resulting in sparse and infrequent updates. In this work, we explore the use of a pretrained, highly-multimodal earth-observation model for generating large-scale spatially complete (wall-to-wall) LFMC maps. Our approach achieves significant improvements over previous methods using randomly initialized models (20 reduction in RMSE). We provide an automated pipeline that enables rapid generation of these LFMC maps across the United States, and demonstrate its effectiveness in two regions recently impacted by wildfire (Eaton and Palisades).

<title>A case for data valuation transparency via DValCards</title>

Abstract: Following the rise in popularity of data-centric machine learning (ML), various data valuation methods have been proposed to quantify the contribution of each datapoint to desired ML model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy). Beyond the technical applications of data valuation methods (e.g., data cleaning, data acquisition, etc.), it has been suggested that within the context of data markets, data buyers might utilize such methods to fairly compensate data owners. Here we demonstrate that data valuation metrics are inherently biased and unstable under simple algorithmic design choices, resulting in both technical and ethical implications. By analyzing 9 tabular classification datasets and 6 data valuation methods, we illustrate how (1) common and inexpensive data pre-processing techniques can drastically alter estimated data values; (2) subsampling via data valuation metrics may increase class imbalance; and (3) data valuation metrics may undervalue underrepresented group data. Consequently, we argue in favor of increased transparency associated with data valuation in-the-wild and introduce the novel Data Valuation Cards (DValCards) framework towards this aim. The proliferation of DValCards will reduce misuse of data valuation metrics, including in data pricing, and build trust in responsible ML systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for knowledge graph completion tasks.

<title>BlockFFN: Towards End-Side Acceleration-Friendly Mixture-of-Experts with Chunk-Level Activation Sparsity</title>

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs), architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts (MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g., end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques (e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally, we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over 80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Abstract: Deep learning models incorporating linear SSMs have gained attention for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, their large parameter sizes pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this study, we propose an efficient parameter reduction method for these models by applying $H^{2}$ model order reduction techniques from control theory to their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show that the model compression based on our proposed method outperforms an existing method using the Balanced Truncation, while successfully reducing the number of parameters in the SSMs to $1/32$ without sacrificing the performance of the original models.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for determining representational alignment, which builds upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Particularly, this new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can emerge and organise in autoencoder models, through a controlled ablation study in which only the activation function is altered. Using this technique, the validity of whether function-driven symmetries can act as implicit inductive biases on representations is determined. Representations are found to tend to discretise when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. This confirms the hypothesis: algebraic symmetries of network primitives can carry unintended inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in representations. The discrete symmetry of contemporary forms is shown to be a strong predictor for the induction of discrete representations transformed from otherwise continuous structures -- a quantisation effect. This motivates further reassessment of functional forms in common usage. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data distributions and settings.

Abstract: Generative AI models have substantially improved the realism of synthetic media, yet their misuse through sophisticated DeepFakes poses significant risks. Despite recent advances in deepfake detection, fairness remains inadequately addressed, enabling deepfake markers to exploit biases against specific populations. While previous studies have emphasized group-level fairness, individual fairness (i.e., ensuring similar predictions for similar individuals) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify for the first time that the original principle of individual fairness fundamentally fails in the context of deepfake detection, revealing a critical gap previously unexplored in the literature. To mitigate it, we propose the first generalizable framework that can be integrated into existing deepfake detectors to enhance individual fairness and generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on leading deepfake datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves individual fairness while maintaining robust detection performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Purdue-M2/Individual-Fairness-Deepfake-Detection.

<title>Distributional Unlearning: Forgetting Distributions, Not Just Samples</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove unwanted information from trained models, initially at the individual-sample level, but increasingly at the level of entire sub-populations. In many deployments, models must delete whole topical domains to satisfy privacy, legal, or quality requirements, e.g., removing several users' posts under GDPR or copyrighted web content. Existing unlearning tools remain largely sample-oriented, and straightforward point deletion often leaves enough residual signal for downstream learners to recover the unwanted domain. We introduce distributional unlearning, a data-centric, model-agnostic framework that asks: Given examples from an unwanted distribution and a retained distribution, what is the smallest set of points whose removal makes the edited dataset far from the unwanted domain yet close to the retained one? Using Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify removal and preservation, we derive the exact Pareto frontier in the Gaussian case and prove that any model retrained on the edited data incurs log-loss shifts bounded by the divergence thresholds. We propose a simple distance-based selection rule satisfying these constraints with a quadratic reduction in deletion budget compared to random removal. Experiments on synthetic Gaussians, Jigsaw Toxic Comments, SMS spam, and CIFAR-10 show 15-72% fewer deletions than random, with negligible impact on retained performance.

Abstract: Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which aims to find an optimal decision that minimizes the worst case cost over the ambiguity set of probability distribution, has been widely applied in diverse applications, e.g., network behavior analysis, risk management, etc. However, existing DRO techniques face three key challenges: 1) how to deal with the asynchronous updating in a distributed environment; 2) how to leverage the prior distribution effectively; 3) how to properly adjust the degree of robustness according to different scenarios. To this end, we propose an asynchronous distributed algorithm, named Asynchronous Single-looP alternatIve gRadient projEction (ASPIRE) algorithm with the itErative Active SEt method (EASE) to tackle the federated distributionally robust optimization (FDRO) problem. Furthermore, a new uncertainty set, i.e., constrained D-norm uncertainty set, is developed to effectively leverage the prior distribution and flexibly control the degree of robustness. Finally, our theoretical analysis elucidates that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge and the iteration complexity is also analyzed. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can not only achieve fast convergence, and remain robust against data heterogeneity as well as malicious attacks, but also tradeoff robustness with performance.

Abstract: Language model (LM) distillation aims at distilling the knowledge in a large teacher LM to a small student one. As a critical issue facing LM distillation, a superior student often arises from a teacher of a relatively small scale instead of a larger one, especially in the presence of substantial capacity gap between the teacher and student. This issue, often referred to as the \textit{curse of capacity gap}, suggests that there is likely an optimal teacher yielding the best-performing student along the scaling course of the teacher. Consequently, distillation trials on teachers of a wide range of scales are called for to determine the optimal teacher, which becomes computationally intensive in the context of large LMs (LLMs). This paper addresses this critical bottleneck by providing the \textit{law of capacity gap} inducted from a preliminary study on distilling a broad range of small-scale (<3B) LMs, where the optimal teacher consistently scales linearly with the student scale across different model and data scales. By extending the law to LLM distillation on a larger scale (7B), we succeed in obtaining versatile LLMs that outperform a wide array of competitors.

Abstract: Historical records of climate fields are often sparse due to missing measurements, especially before the introduction of large-scale satellite missions. Several statistical and model-based methods have been introduced to fill gaps and reconstruct historical records. Here, we employ a recently introduced deep-learning approach based on Fourier convolutions, trained on numerical climate model output, to reconstruct historical climate fields. Using this approach we are able to realistically reconstruct large and irregular areas of missing data, as well as reconstruct known historical events such as strong El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na with very little given information. Our method outperforms the widely used statistical kriging method as well as other recent machine learning approaches. The model generalizes to higher resolutions than the ones it was trained on and can be used on a variety of climate fields. Moreover, it allows inpainting of masks never seen before during the model training.

Abstract: People aptly exhibit general intelligence behaviors through flexible problem-solving and the ability to adapt to novel situations by reusing and applying high-level knowledge acquired over time. In contrast, artificial agents tend to be specialists, lacking such generalist behaviors. To bridge this gap, artificial agents will require understanding and exploiting critical structured knowledge representations. We introduce a metacognitive reasoning framework, Knowledge-Interaction-eXecution (KIX), and argue that interactions with objects, by leveraging a type space, facilitate the learning of transferable interaction concepts and promote generalization. This framework offers a principled approach for integrating knowledge into reinforcement learning and holds promise as an enabler for generalist behaviors in artificial intelligence, robotics, and autonomous systems.

FAST segments piecewise constant shape functions for each feature in a dataset to produce transparent additive models. The framework leverages a novel optimization procedure to fit these models $\sim$2 orders of magnitude faster than existing state-of-the-art methods, such as explainable boosting machines \citep{nori2019interpretml}. We also develop new feature selection algorithms in the FAST framework to fit parsimonious models that perform well. Through experiments and case studies, we show that FAST improves the computational efficiency and interpretability of additive models.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a powerful and popular technique for personalization, enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained image generation models for specific tasks without comprehensive retraining. While employing individual pre-trained LoRA models excels at representing single concepts, such as those representing a specific dog or a cat, utilizing multiple LoRA models to capture a variety of concepts in a single image still poses a significant challenge. Existing methods often fall short, primarily because the attention mechanisms within different LoRA models overlap, leading to scenarios where one concept may be completely ignored (e.g., omitting the dog) or where concepts are incorrectly combined (e.g., producing an image of two cats instead of one cat and one dog). We introduce CLoRA, a training-free approach that addresses these limitations by updating the attention maps of multiple LoRA models at test-time, and leveraging the attention maps to create semantic masks for fusing latent representations. This enables the generation of composite images that accurately reflect the characteristics of each LoRA. Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that CLoRA significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-concept image generation using LoRAs.

Abstract: We introduce the Cooperative Network Architecture (CNA), a model that represents sensory signals using structured, recurrently connected networks of neurons, termed "nets." Nets are dynamically assembled from overlapping net fragments, which are learned based on statistical regularities in sensory input. This architecture offers robustness to noise, deformation, and out-of-distribution data, addressing challenges in current vision systems from a novel perspective. We demonstrate that net fragments can be learned without supervision and flexibly recombined to encode novel patterns, enabling figure completion and resilience to noise. Our findings establish CNA as a promising paradigm for developing neural representations that integrate local feature processing with global structure formation, providing a foundation for future research on invariant object recognition.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into corporate strategy has become critical for organizations seeking to maintain a competitive advantage in the digital age. As AI transforms business models, operations, and decision-making, the need for dedicated executive leadership to guide, govern, and orchestrate this transformation becomes increasingly evident. This paper examines emerging future scenarios across three domains: the AI Economy, the AI Organization, and Competition in the Age of AI. These domains reveal environmental, structural, and strategic tensions that existing C-suite roles struggle to resolve. In response, the paper develops a theory-informed framework for the Chief AI Officer (CAIO), outlining the distinct functions and capabilities required to guide and govern AI at scale. Drawing on illustrative cases and emerging practice, this conceptualization clarifies the CAIOs unique role within the executive landscape and presents a forward-looking research agenda. This paper advances the discourse on AI leadership by offering a theory-driven rationale for the strategic integration of AI at the executive level and by positioning the Chief AI Officer as a distinct and necessary role within modern organizations.

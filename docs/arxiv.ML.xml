Abstract: The main goal of this article is to convince you, the reader, that supervised learning in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model is closely related to -- of all things -- bipartite matching! En-route from PAC learning to bipartite matching, I will overview a particular transductive model of learning, and associated one-inclusion graphs, which can be viewed as a generalization of some of the hat puzzles that are popular in recreational mathematics. Whereas this transductive model is far from new, it has recently seen a resurgence of interest as a tool for tackling deep questions in learning theory. A secondary purpose of this article could be as a (biased) tutorial on the connections between the PAC and transductive models of learning.

Summary:<br />
Reduced order models (ROMs) are essential in fluid mechanics for cost-effective predictions. This study introduces a novel nonlinear reduction strategy tailored for transient flows, incorporating parametrisation and uncertainty quantification through a variational auto-encoder (VAE) using variational inference for confidence measurement. By utilizing a latent space transformer with attention mechanisms, the model can predict dynamical systems with enhanced generalization capabilities across diverse dynamics. The integration of confidence metrics enables informed decision-making and robust model performance, facilitating more efficient sampling of the parameter space to improve predictions across the entire range without complete evaluation data. This approach aims to address the challenges of nonlinear reduction techniques in transient environments, advancing the applicability and reliability of ROMs in engineering applications.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.

Abstract: Recent research on graph neural networks (GNNs) has explored mechanisms for capturing local uncertainty and exploiting graph hierarchies to mitigate data sparsity and leverage structural properties. However, the synergistic integration of these two approaches remains underexplored. This work introduces a novel architecture, the Hierarchical Uncertainty-Aware Graph Neural Network (HU-GNN), which unifies multi-scale representation learning, principled uncertainty estimation, and self-supervised embedding diversity within a single end-to-end framework. Specifically, HU-GNN adaptively forms node clusters and estimates uncertainty at multiple structural scales from individual nodes to higher levels. These uncertainty estimates guide a robust message-passing mechanism and attention weighting, effectively mitigating noise and adversarial perturbations while preserving predictive accuracy on semi-supervised classification tasks. We also offer key theoretical contributions, including a probabilistic formulation, rigorous uncertainty-calibration guarantees, and formal robustness bounds. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art robustness and interpretability.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to visual storytelling by leveraging transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models on the Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset. The proposed VIST-GPT model generates visually grounded and contextually appropriate narratives. Traditional evaluation metrics like BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr are deemed insufficient for this task, so the authors introduce RoViST and GROOVIST metrics to better assess visual storytelling quality in terms of visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These reference-free metrics offer a more comprehensive evaluation that closely aligns with human judgment. Overall, the paper presents a cutting-edge method for enhancing the quality and evaluation of narratives in the field of visual storytelling.

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the relationship between singular value spectra of concatenated matrices and their individual components. It introduces a perturbation framework that extends classical results like Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices, providing analytical bounds for the stability of singular values under small perturbations in submatrices. The study shows that when concatenated matrices are close in norm, the dominant singular values of the resultant matrix remain stable. This insight allows for controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression, offering potential for improved matrix clustering and compression strategies. The findings have implications in various fields including numerical linear algebra, signal processing, and data-driven modeling.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Concatenating matrices is a common technique for uncovering shared structures in data through singular value decomposition (SVD) and low-rank approximations. However, a fundamental question arises: how does the singular value spectrum of the concatenated matrix relate to the spectra of its individual components? In this work, we develop a perturbation framework that extends classical results such as Weyl's inequality to concatenated matrices. We establish analytical bounds that quantify the stability of singular values under small perturbations in the submatrices. Our results show that if the matrices being concatenated are close in norm, the dominant singular values of the concatenated matrix remain stable, enabling controlled trade-offs between accuracy and compression. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for improved matrix clustering and compression strategies, with applications in numerical linear algebra, signal processing, and data-driven modeling.

Summary: 
The study introduces a framework for generating global stress data and achieving high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields in two-phase random materials under dynamic loading. The Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion) model incorporates a Space-Time U-Net and explores different attention positions for model accuracy.

arXiv:2505.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and performance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in materials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in two-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often associated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key locations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering applications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data and its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for deep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress fields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In this study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and spatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress Diffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data. This framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically investigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy. Next, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal super-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed Operator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning method. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights on model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based constraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during training and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to arbitrary magnifications.

Abstract: Integrating human expertise with machine learning is crucial for applications demanding high accuracy and safety, such as autonomous driving. This study introduces Interactive Double Deep Q-network (iDDQN), a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach that enhances Reinforcement Learning (RL) by merging human insights directly into the RL training process, improving model performance. Our proposed iDDQN method modifies the Q-value update equation to integrate human and agent actions, establishing a collaborative approach for policy development. Additionally, we present an offline evaluative framework that simulates the agent's trajectory as if no human intervention had occurred, to assess the effectiveness of human interventions. Empirical results in simulated autonomous driving scenarios demonstrate that iDDQN outperforms established approaches, including Behavioral Cloning (BC), HG-DAgger, Deep Q-Learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), and vanilla DRL in leveraging human expertise for improving performance and adaptability.

<div> Keywords: injection moulding, machine learning, explainable AI, feature impact analysis, root cause analysis

Summary:
This study explores the use of machine learning models in predicting the quality characteristics of products in the injection moulding process. It highlights the importance of explainable AI methods in providing insights into the root causes of deviations in product properties. The research demonstrates the existence of interactions among input machine settings and compares various model-agnostic explainability methods to analyze feature impacts. The study shows that different explainability methods can lead to different feature attributions, which in turn affect the accuracy of cause identification in injection moulding. By performing explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron models, the study aims to provide actionable insights for improving the quality control process. Overall, the findings emphasize the significance of using explainable AI for accurate root cause analysis and quality control in injection moulding processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a product deviates from its desired properties in the injection moulding process, its root cause analysis can be aided by models that relate the input machine settings with the output quality characteristics. The machine learning models tested in the quality prediction are mostly black boxes; therefore, no direct explanation of their prognosis is given, which restricts their applicability in the quality control. The previously attempted explainability methods are either restricted to tree-based algorithms only or do not emphasize on the fact that some explainability methods can lead to wrong root cause identification of a product's deviation from its desired properties. This study first shows that the interactions among the multiple input machine settings do exist in real experimental data collected as per a central composite design. Then, the model-agnostic explainable AI methods are compared for the first time to show that different explainability methods indeed lead to different feature impact analysis in injection moulding. Moreover, it is shown that the better feature attribution translates to the correct cause identification and actionable insights for the injection moulding process. Being model agnostic, explanations on both random forest and multilayer perceptron are performed for the cause analysis, as both models have the mean absolute percentage error of less than 0.05% on the experimental dataset.

<div> Keywords: Audio-visual segmentation, OpenAVS, multimedia foundation models, self-training, unsupervised learning

Summary: 
OpenAVS introduces a novel language-based approach for Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) that aligns audio and visual modalities using text as a proxy. By leveraging multimedia foundation models, OpenAVS infers masks through audio-to-text prompt generation, LLM-guided prompt translation, and text-to-visual sounding object segmentation. The architecture is designed to transfer knowledge effectively to the downstream AVS task and can be integrated with any supervised AVS model using OpenAVS-ST, a model-agnostic framework that enables self-training with pseudo-labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that OpenAVS outperforms existing unsupervised, zero-shot, and few-shot AVS methods, achieving significant performance gains in challenging scenarios. The approach demonstrates superior performance in mIoU and F-score metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in open-vocabulary audio-visual segmentation tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation aims to separate sounding objects from videos by predicting pixel-level masks based on audio signals. Existing methods primarily concentrate on closed-set scenarios and direct audio-visual alignment and fusion, which limits their capability to generalize to new, unseen situations. In this paper, we propose OpenAVS, a novel training-free language-based approach that, for the first time, effectively aligns audio and visual modalities using text as a proxy for open-vocabulary Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS). Equipped with multimedia foundation models, OpenAVS directly infers masks through 1) audio-to-text prompt generation, 2) LLM-guided prompt translation, and 3) text-to-visual sounding object segmentation. The objective of OpenAVS is to establish a simple yet flexible architecture that relies on the most appropriate foundation models by fully leveraging their capabilities to enable more effective knowledge transfer to the downstream AVS task. Moreover, we present a model-agnostic framework OpenAVS-ST that enables the integration of OpenAVS with any advanced supervised AVS model via pseudo-label based self-training. This approach enhances performance by effectively utilizing large-scale unlabeled data when available. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of OpenAVS. It surpasses existing unsupervised, zero-shot, and few-shot AVS methods by a significant margin, achieving absolute performance gains of approximately 9.4% and 10.9% in mIoU and F-score, respectively, in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72% on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while maintaining performance standards.

Summary:
In this study, the focus is on the increasing automation of traffic management systems, which are vulnerable to cyberattacks that disrupt urban mobility and public safety. Traditional network-layer defenses are often not accessible to transportation agencies, leading to the development of a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on traffic flow data. The researchers simulate cyberattacks in a virtualized traffic network environment and develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system to identify compromised signals, with Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance being identified as key indicators. The use of Explainable AI techniques helps in interpreting critical decision factors and diagnosing misclassification errors. Two primary challenges are identified: transitional data inconsistencies and model limitations that can lead to stealth attacks evading detection, particularly in low-traffic conditions. This work aims to enhance AI-driven traffic security by improving detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart transportation systems.

Abstract: The increasing automation of traffic management systems has made them prime targets for cyberattacks, disrupting urban mobility and public safety. Traditional network-layer defenses are often inaccessible to transportation agencies, necessitating a machine learning-based approach that relies solely on traffic flow data. In this study, we simulate cyberattacks in a semi-realistic environment, using a virtualized traffic network to analyze disruption patterns. We develop a deep learning-based anomaly detection system, demonstrating that Longest Stop Duration and Total Jam Distance are key indicators of compromised signals. To enhance interpretability, we apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, identifying critical decision factors and diagnosing misclassification errors. Our analysis reveals two primary challenges: transitional data inconsistencies, where mislabeled recovery-phase traffic misleads the model, and model limitations, where stealth attacks in low-traffic conditions evade detection. This work enhances AI-driven traffic security, improving both detection accuracy and trustworthiness in smart transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper presents our simulation of cyber-attacks and detection strategies on the traffic control system in Daytona Beach, FL. using Raspberry Pi virtual machines and the OPNSense firewall, along with traffic dynamics from SUMO and exploitation via the Metasploit framework. We try to answer the research questions: are we able to identify cyber attacks by only analyzing traffic flow patterns. In this research, the cyber attacks are focused particularly when lights are randomly turned all green or red at busy intersections by adversarial attackers. Despite challenges stemming from imbalanced data and overlapping traffic patterns, our best model shows 85\% accuracy when detecting intrusions purely using traffic flow statistics.

The article introduces a refined approach to efficiently fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on specific domains such as mathematics by using a budgeted subset selection method. By combining utility and diversity metrics, the approach selects informative and representative training examples to achieve near-full dataset performance while reducing computational cost and training time. The utility metric considers perplexity and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) loss to identify challenging examples crucial for model learning, while the diversity metric ensures coverage across mathematical subdomains.

Abstract: We propose a refined approach to efficiently fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on specific domains like the mathematical domain by employing a budgeted subset selection method. Our approach combines utility and diversity metrics to select the most informative and representative training examples. The final goal is to achieve near-full dataset performance with meticulously selected data points from the entire dataset while significantly reducing computational cost and training time and achieving competitive performance as the full dataset. The utility metric incorporates both perplexity and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) loss to identify challenging examples that contribute most to model learning, while the diversity metric ensures broad coverage across mathematical subdomains. We evaluate our method on LLaMA-3 8B and Phi-3 models, comparing against several baseline approaches, including random selection, diversity-based sampling, and existing state-of-the-art subset selection techniques.

<div> contexture theory, representation learning methods, singular functions, model scaling, context evaluation

Summary: The paper introduces the concept of the contexture theory, which characterizes representation learning as learning from the association between input and a context variable. It shows that popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context. The theory applies to various learning paradigms such as supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning, and shows that representations learning the contexture are optimal for tasks compatible with the context. The theory suggests that further scaling up model size yields diminishing returns once it approximates the top singular functions. It emphasizes the need for better contexts for further improvement. The paper also proposes a metric to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowledge of downstream tasks, showing a correlation with encoder performance on real datasets. <div>

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of foundation models, we do not have a systematic characterization of the representations that these models learn. In this paper, we establish the contexture theory. It shows that a large class of representation learning methods can be characterized as learning from the association between the input and a context variable. Specifically, we show that many popular methods aim to approximate the top-d singular functions of the expectation operator induced by the context, in which case we say that the representation learns the contexture. We demonstrate the generality of the contexture theory by proving that representation learning within various learning paradigms -- supervised, self-supervised, and manifold learning -- can all be studied from such a perspective. We also prove that the representations that learn the contexture are optimal on those tasks that are compatible with the context. One important implication of the contexture theory is that once the model is large enough to approximate the top singular functions, further scaling up the model size yields diminishing returns. Therefore, scaling is not all we need, and further improvement requires better contexts. To this end, we study how to evaluate the usefulness of a context without knowing the downstream tasks. We propose a metric and show by experiments that it correlates well with the actual performance of the encoder on many real datasets.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of adapting to non-stationary network conditions and the limitations of current solutions based on stationary assumptions. It highlights the problem of neural networks suffering from plasticity loss, affecting their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. The Silent Neuron theory is introduced as a comprehensive framework to understand plasticity degradation. The Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN) approach is proposed to address this limitation by strategically resetting neurons based on forward and backward propagation states. In an adaptive video streaming system implementation, ReSiN demonstrated significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving higher bitrate and better quality of experience while maintaining smoothness. The solution also performs well in stationary environments, showcasing robust adaptability across different network conditions. <div>

Abstract: Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE) while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability across different network conditions.

<div> ML-driven house price prediction, ethnic bias, racial bias, fairness, bias mitigation

Summary: 
The paper focuses on the development of Machine Learning (ML) models for house price prediction and investigates the presence of ethnic and racial bias in these models. Through a combination of structural and neighborhood-level attributes, ML models are developed and assessed for bias towards protected attributes such as race and ethnicity. The study finds varying levels of bias in the ML-driven house price prediction models and explores different bias mitigation solutions. The experimental results show that in-processing bias mitigation approaches tend to be more effective than pre-processing methods in addressing bias in this problem domain. The research highlights the importance of ethical considerations in ML-driven solutions for improving housing conditions and promoting social equity. The code for the study is available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As a basic human need, housing plays a key role in enhancing health, well-being, and educational outcome in society, and the housing market is a major factor for promoting quality of life and ensuring social equity. To improve the housing conditions, there has been extensive research on building Machine Learning (ML)-driven house price prediction solutions to accurately forecast the future conditions, and help inform actions and policies in the field. In spite of their success in developing high-accuracy models, there is a gap in our understanding of the extent to which various ML-driven house price prediction approaches show ethnic and/or racial bias, which in turn is essential for the responsible use of ML, and ensuring that the ML-driven solutions do not exacerbate inequity. To fill this gap, this paper develops several ML models from a combination of structural and neighborhood-level attributes, and conducts comprehensive assessments on the fairness of ML models under various definitions of privileged groups. As a result, it finds that the ML-driven house price prediction models show various levels of bias towards protected attributes (i.e., race and ethnicity in this study). Then, it investigates the performance of different bias mitigation solutions, and the experimental results show their various levels of effectiveness on different ML-driven methods. However, in general, the in-processing bias mitigation approach tends to be more effective than the pre-processing one in this problem domain.

Summary: 
The study explores the compute efficiency of LLM training with different parameterizations, focusing on the transfer of optimal hyperparameters across changes in model depth. Some parameterizations struggle with transferring base hyperparameters, leading to suboptimal training or costly re-tuning. Additionally, certain parameterizations may result in lazy learning, restricting the depth and nonlinearity of layers. The proposed parameterization, CompleteP, achieves depth-wise hyperparameter transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. This approach allows for improved compute efficiency, enabling a wider range of model width/depth ratios for various hardware and operational contexts. CompleteP delivers 12-34% efficiency gains compared to existing methods. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compute efficiency of LLM training when using different parameterizations, i.e., rules for adjusting model and optimizer hyperparameters (HPs) as model size changes. Some parameterizations fail to transfer optimal base HPs (such as learning rate) across changes in model depth, requiring practitioners to either re-tune these HPs as they scale up (expensive), or accept sub-optimal training when re-tuning is prohibitive. Even when they achieve HP transfer, we develop theory to show parameterizations may still exist in the lazy learning regime where layers learn only features close to their linearization, preventing effective use of depth and nonlinearity. Finally, we identify and adopt the unique parameterization we call CompleteP that achieves both depth-wise HP transfer and non-lazy learning in all layers. CompleteP enables a wider range of model width/depth ratios to remain compute-efficient, unlocking shapes better suited for different hardware settings and operational contexts. Moreover, CompleteP enables 12-34\% compute efficiency improvements over the prior state-of-the-art.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach for enhancing safe reinforcement learning (RL) by utilizing offline demonstration data. The SSkP method consists of two stages: first, a skill risk predictor is learned using PU learning from the offline data, and second, a risk planning process is employed to improve online safe RL by learning a risk-averse policy while adapting the skill risk predictor to the environment. Experimental results in various robotic simulation environments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art safe RL methods consistently. The SSkP approach effectively combines offline data with online interactions to learn a safe policy and mitigate risks, demonstrating the potential for enhancing safe RL in real-world applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure safety when an RL agent conducts learning by interacting with real-world environments where improper actions can induce high costs or lead to severe consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel Safe Skill Planning (SSkP) approach to enhance effective safe RL by exploiting auxiliary offline demonstration data. SSkP involves a two-stage process. First, we employ PU learning to learn a skill risk predictor from the offline demonstration data. Then, based on the learned skill risk predictor, we develop a novel risk planning process to enhance online safe RL and learn a risk-averse safe policy efficiently through interactions with the online RL environment, while simultaneously adapting the skill risk predictor to the environment. We conduct experiments in several benchmark robotic simulation environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art safe RL methods.

<div> Keywords: conceptual design phase, functional modeling, Function-Behavior-Structure framework, Large Language Models, domain adaptation<br />
Summary: <br />
The article discusses the importance of the conceptual design phase in product development, where designers generate solutions based on functional requirements. Functional modeling, particularly using the Function-Behavior-Structure framework, helps translate functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the lack of comprehensive functional data often hinders effective design decision-making. The study proposes a new approach using Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT architectures, for automated classification of mechanical assembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the accuracy and consistency of function annotation can be improved. A case study showcasing fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on the Oregon State Design Repository data demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. The domain-adapted LLM helps generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective design exploration in early-phase engineering. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conceptual design phase represents a critical early stage in the product development process, where designers generate potential solutions that meet predefined design specifications based on functional requirements. Functional modeling, a foundational aspect of this phase, enables designers to reason about product functions before specific structural details are determined. A widely adopted approach to functional modeling is the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework, which supports the transformation of functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the effectiveness of function-based design is often hindered by the lack of well-structured and comprehensive functional data. This scarcity can negatively impact early design decision-making and hinder the development of accurate behavioral models. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as those based on GPT architectures, offer a promising avenue to address this gap. LLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities in language understanding and natural language processing (NLP), making them suitable for automated classification tasks. This study proposes a novel LLM-based domain adaptation (DA) framework using fine-tuning for the automated classification of mechanical assembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the traditionally manual and subjective process of function annotation can be improved in both accuracy and consistency. A case study demonstrates fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on data from the Oregon State Design Repository (OSDR), and evaluation on the A Big CAD (ABC) dataset shows that the domain-adapted LLM can generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the semantic representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective design exploration in early-phase engineering.

Summary: This paper introduces a novel approach to fair machine learning by addressing biases in predictions on graph data. It focuses on non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) settings, where data instances are interconnected in social networks. By leveraging the Network Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and two key assumptions, Decomposability and Graph Independence, the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal Inference (MPVA) is developed to compute interventional distributions and enable causally fair node classification. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show that MPVA outperforms existing methods by effectively mitigating bias. The study highlights the potential of causality-based fairness in complex machine learning applications and suggests further research into relaxing initial assumptions to enhance model fairness. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Fair machine learning seeks to identify and mitigate biases in predictions against unfavorable populations characterized by demographic attributes, such as race and gender. Recently, a few works have extended fairness to graph data, such as social networks, but most of them neglect the causal relationships among data instances. This paper addresses the prevalent challenge in fairness-aware ML algorithms, which typically assume Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data. We tackle the overlooked domain of non-IID, graph-based settings where data instances are interconnected, influencing the outcomes of fairness interventions. We base our research on the Network Structural Causal Model (NSCM) framework and posit two main assumptions: Decomposability and Graph Independence, which enable the computation of interventional distributions in non-IID settings using the $do$-calculus. Based on that, we develop the Message Passing Variational Autoencoder for Causal Inference (MPVA) to compute interventional distributions and facilitate causally fair node classification through estimated interventional distributions. Empirical evaluations on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MPVA outperforms conventional methods by effectively approximating interventional distributions and mitigating bias. The implications of our findings underscore the potential of causality-based fairness in complex ML applications, setting the stage for further research into relaxing the initial assumptions to enhance model fairness.

The article introduces Focal-SAM as a method to address the challenges posed by long-tailed distributions in real-world datasets. It aims to improve generalization by flattening the loss landscape, offering fine-grained control without the need for multiple backpropagations like existing methods ImbSAM and CC-SAM. Focal-SAM assigns different penalties to class-wise sharpness, striking a balance between computational efficiency and control over the loss landscape. The method is theoretically analyzed for its generalization ability and a sharper generalization bound is derived. Extensive experiments on various models confirm the effectiveness of Focal-SAM in improving generalization to tail classes. <div>

Abstract: Real-world datasets often follow a long-tailed distribution, making generalization to tail classes difficult. Recent methods resorted to long-tail variants of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), such as ImbSAM and CC-SAM, to improve generalization by flattening the loss landscape. However, these attempts face a trade-off between computational efficiency and control over the loss landscape. On the one hand, ImbSAM is efficient but offers only coarse control as it excludes head classes from the SAM process. On the other hand, CC-SAM provides fine-grained control through class-dependent perturbations but at the cost of efficiency due to multiple backpropagations. Seeing this dilemma, we introduce Focal-SAM, which assigns different penalties to class-wise sharpness, achieving fine-grained control without extra backpropagations, thus maintaining efficiency. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze Focal-SAM's generalization ability and derive a sharper generalization bound. Extensive experiments on both traditional and foundation models validate the effectiveness of Focal-SAM.

Summary: 
The study introduces the Adaptively Point-Weighting (APW) curriculum learning algorithm for training deep networks. APW assigns weights to training samples based on their training error and the network's current state. It prioritizes easy samples in the early training phase to capture overall characteristics quickly and switches to hard samples later for improved fitting performance. The algorithm's properties, including training effectiveness, feasibility, stability, and generalization performance, are theoretically analyzed and validated through numerical experiments. APW demonstrates superiority in training deep networks, supported by empirical evidence and theoretical findings. <div>

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) is referred to as a training strategy that makes easy samples learned first and then fits hard samples. It imitates the process of humans learning knowledge, and has become a potential manner of effectively training deep networks. In this study, we develop the adaptively point-weighting (APW) curriculum learning algorithm, which adaptively assigns the weight to every training sample not only based on its training error but also considering the current training state of the network. Specifically, in the early training phase, it increases the weights of easy samples to make the network rapidly capture the overall characteristics of the dataset; and in the later training phase, the weights of hard points rise to improve the fitting performance on the discrete local regions. Moreover, we also present the theoretical analysis on the properties of APW including training effectiveness, training feasibility, training stability, and generalization performance. The numerical experiments support the superiority of APW and demonstrate the validity of our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in protein-ligand docking, especially in modern deep learning methods, and some benchmarks were proposed, e.g., PoseBench, Plinder. However, these benchmarks suffer from less practical evaluation setups (e.g., blind docking, self docking), or heavy framework that involves training, raising challenges to assess docking methods efficiently. To fill this gap, we proposed PoseX, an open-source benchmark focusing on self-docking and cross-docking, to evaluate the algorithmic advances practically and comprehensively. Specifically, first, we curate a new evaluation dataset with 718 entries for self docking and 1,312 for cross docking; second, we incorporate 22 docking methods across three methodological categories, including (1) traditional physics-based methods (e.g., Schr\"odinger Glide), (2) AI docking methods (e.g., DiffDock), (3) AI co-folding methods (e.g., AlphaFold3); third, we design a relaxation method as post-processing to minimize conformation energy and refine binding pose; fourth, we released a leaderboard to rank submitted models in real time. We draw some key insights via extensive experiments: (1) AI-based approaches have already surpassed traditional physics-based approaches in overall docking accuracy (RMSD). The longstanding generalization issues that have plagued AI molecular docking have been significantly alleviated in the latest models. (2) The stereochemical deficiencies of AI-based approaches can be greatly alleviated with post-processing relaxation. Combining AI docking methods with the enhanced relaxation method achieves the best performance to date. (3) AI co-folding methods commonly face ligand chirality issues, which cannot be resolved by relaxation. The code, curated dataset and leaderboard are released at https://github.com/CataAI/PoseX.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and forecasting complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is crucial in various scientific and engineering domains. However, traditional numerical methods struggle in real-world scenarios due to incomplete or unknown physical laws. Meanwhile, machine learning approaches often fail to generalize effectively when faced with scarce observational data and the challenge of capturing local and global features. To this end, we propose the Physics-encoded Spectral Attention Network (PeSANet), which integrates local and global information to forecast complex systems with limited data and incomplete physical priors. The model consists of two key components: a physics-encoded block that uses hard constraints to approximate local differential operators from limited data, and a spectral-enhanced block that captures long-range global dependencies in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce a novel spectral attention mechanism to model inter-spectrum relationships and learn long-range spatial features. Experimental results demonstrate that PeSANet outperforms existing methods across all metrics, particularly in long-term forecasting accuracy, providing a promising solution for simulating complex systems with limited data and incomplete physics.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel framework called VLoRP, which extends low-rank gradient projection by allowing for control over the trade-off between memory efficiency and performance through projection granularity. The finer-grained projections offered by VLoRP enhance stability and efficiency even within a fixed memory constraint. The study also introduces ProjFactor, an adaptive memory-efficient optimizer, that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining competitive performance, even with gradient accumulation. The theoretical analysis presented demonstrates the descent and convergence of VLoRP under both SGD and ProjFactor optimization methods. Extensive experiments across various tasks validate the findings, including common sense reasoning, MMLU, and GSM8K. Overall, the study highlights the importance of projection granularity in enhancing memory efficiency and performance in gradient projection methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the success of low-rank adapter (LoRA), low-rank gradient projection (LoRP) has emerged as a promising solution for memory-efficient fine-tuning. However, existing LoRP methods typically treat each row of the gradient matrix as the default projection unit, leaving the role of projection granularity underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel framework, VLoRP, that extends low-rank gradient projection by introducing an additional degree of freedom for controlling the trade-off between memory efficiency and performance, beyond the rank hyper-parameter. Through this framework, we systematically explore the impact of projection granularity, demonstrating that finer-grained projections lead to enhanced stability and efficiency even under a fixed memory budget. Regarding the optimization for VLoRP, we present ProjFactor, an adaptive memory-efficient optimizer, that significantly reduces memory requirement while ensuring competitive performance, even in the presence of gradient accumulation. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of VLoRP, demonstrating the descent and convergence of its optimization trajectory under both SGD and ProjFactor. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our findings, covering tasks such as commonsense reasoning, MMLU, and GSM8K.

Abstract: Online anomaly detection is essential in fields such as cybersecurity, healthcare, and industrial monitoring, where promptly identifying deviations from expected behavior can avert critical failures or security breaches. While numerous anomaly scoring methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been proposed, current approaches typically rely on a continuous stream of real-world calibration data to provide assumption-free guarantees on the false discovery rate (FDR). To address the inherent challenges posed by limited real calibration data, we introduce context-aware prediction-powered conformal online anomaly detection (C-PP-COAD). Our framework strategically leverages synthetic calibration data to mitigate data scarcity, while adaptively integrating real data based on contextual cues. C-PP-COAD utilizes conformal p-values, active p-value statistics, and online FDR control mechanisms to maintain rigorous and reliable anomaly detection performance over time. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that C-PP-COAD significantly reduces dependency on real calibration data without compromising guaranteed FDR control.

Abstract: With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, high-precision indoor positioning has become essential for Location-Based Services (LBS) in complex indoor environments. Fingerprint-based localization is popular, but traditional algorithms and deep learning-based methods face challenges such as poor generalization, overfitting, and lack of interpretability. This paper applies conformal prediction (CP) to deep learning-based indoor positioning. CP transforms the uncertainty of the model into a non-conformity score, constructs prediction sets to ensure correctness coverage, and provides statistical guarantees. We also introduce conformal risk control for path navigation tasks to manage the false discovery rate (FDR) and the false negative rate (FNR).The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 100% on the training dataset and 85% on the testing dataset, effectively demonstrating its performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, we also develop a conformal p-value framework to control the proportion of position-error points. Experiments on the UJIIndoLoc dataset using lightweight models such as MobileNetV1, VGG19, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and EfficientNet show that the conformal prediction technique can effectively approximate the target coverage, and different models have different performance in terms of prediction set size and uncertainty quantification.

Summary: 
The study introduces two novel frameworks, PINN and LSTM-PINN, integrating policy-aware fertility functions into a partial differential equation for simulating age-structured population dynamics from 2024 to 2054.

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific modeling, particularly for complex dynamical systems; however, accurately capturing age-structured population dynamics under policy-driven fertility changes remains a significant challenge due to the lack of effective integration between domain knowledge and long-term temporal dependencies. To address this issue, we propose two physics-informed deep learning frameworks--PINN and LSTM-PINN--that incorporate policy-aware fertility functions into a transport-reaction partial differential equation to simulate population evolution from 2024 to 2054. The standard PINN model enforces the governing equation and boundary conditions via collocation-based training, enabling accurate learning of underlying population dynamics and ensuring stable convergence. Building on this, the LSTM-PINN framework integrates sequential memory mechanisms to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the age-time domain, achieving robust training performance across multiple loss components. Simulation results under three distinct fertility policy scenarios-the Three-child policy, the Universal two-child policy, and the Separate two-child policy--demonstrate the models' ability to reflect policy-sensitive demographic shifts and highlight the effectiveness of integrating domain knowledge into data-driven forecasting. This study provides a novel and extensible framework for modeling age-structured population dynamics under policy interventions, offering valuable insights for data-informed demographic forecasting and long-term policy planning in the face of emerging population challenges.

Abstract: Conditional decision generation with diffusion models has shown powerful competitiveness in reinforcement learning (RL). Recent studies reveal the relation between energy-function-guidance diffusion models and constrained RL problems. The main challenge lies in estimating the intermediate energy, which is intractable due to the log-expectation formulation during the generation process. To address this issue, we propose the Analytic Energy-guided Policy Optimization (AEPO). Specifically, we first provide a theoretical analysis and the closed-form solution of the intermediate guidance when the diffusion model obeys the conditional Gaussian transformation. Then, we analyze the posterior Gaussian distribution in the log-expectation formulation and obtain the target estimation of the log-expectation under mild assumptions. Finally, we train an intermediate energy neural network to approach the target estimation of log-expectation formulation. We apply our method in 30+ offline RL tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method surpasses numerous representative baselines in D4RL offline reinforcement learning benchmarks.

Summary:
CafCor presents a solution for trustworthy distributed learning that ensures resilience against malicious parties while maintaining data privacy. The algorithm relies on shared randomness between pairs of workers to achieve strong privacy-utility trade-offs without the need for a trusted central server. By integrating robust gradient aggregation with correlated noise injection, CafCor outperforms local differential privacy methods and approaches the utility of central differential privacy. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the practicality of CafCor, showcasing that privacy and robustness can coexist in distributed systems without compromising utility or requiring trust in the server. <div>
arXiv:2505.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience against malicious parties and data privacy are essential for trustworthy distributed learning, yet achieving both with good utility typically requires the strong assumption of a trusted central server. This paper shows that a significantly weaker assumption suffices: each pair of workers shares a randomness seed unknown to others. In a setting where malicious workers may collude with an untrusted server, we propose CafCor, an algorithm that integrates robust gradient aggregation with correlated noise injection, leveraging shared randomness between workers. We prove that CafCor achieves strong privacy-utility trade-offs, significantly outperforming local differential privacy (DP) methods, which do not make any trust assumption, while approaching central DP utility, where the server is fully trusted. Empirical results on standard benchmarks validate CafCor's practicality, showing that privacy and robustness can coexist in distributed systems without sacrificing utility or trusting the server.

<div> Keywords: ONNX Optimizer, OODTE, compiler optimizations, model accuracy, differential testing

Summary: 
OODTE is a utility designed to assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer by utilizing a differential testing approach on a variety of ONNX models. Through this process, 15 issues were detected, with 14 being previously unknown, highlighting problems such as optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. Notably, 9.2% of models experienced issues leading to optimizer crashes or invalid model generation using primary optimization strategies. Furthermore, discrepancies in model accuracy were observed in 30% of classification models, and to a lesser extent in semantic segmentation and object detection models as well. The iterative approach taken by OODTE helped localize the root causes of accuracy differences, providing valuable insights into the performance of the ONNX Optimizer. <div>
arXiv:2505.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With $700$ stars on GitHub and part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer consists of the standard method to apply graph-based optimizations on ONNX models. However, its ability to preserve model accuracy across optimizations, has not been rigorously explored. We propose OODTE, a utility to automatically and thoroughly assess the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE follows a simple, yet effective differential testing and evaluation approach that can be easily adopted to other compiler optimizers. In particular, OODTE utilizes a number of ONNX models, then optimizes them and executes both the original and the optimized variants across a user-defined set of inputs, while automatically logging any issues with the optimization process. Finally, for successfully optimized models, OODTE compares the results, and, if any accuracy deviations are observed, it iteratively repeats the process for each pass of the ONNX Optimizer, to localize the root cause of the differences observed. Using OODTE, we sourced well-known $130$ models from the official ONNX Model Hub, used for a wide variety of tasks (classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question and answering, sentiment analysis) from the official ONNX model hub. We detected 15 issues, 14 of which were previously unknown, associated with optimizer crashes and accuracy deviations. We also observed $9.2$% of all model instances presenting issues leading into the crash of the optimizer, or the generation of an invalid model while using the primary optimizer strategies. In addition, $30$% of the classification models presented accuracy differences across the original and the optimized model variants, while $16.6$% of semantic segmentation and object detection models are also affected, at least to a limited extent.

Summary:
The article introduces LookAlike, a method that improves the consistency of distractors generated by large language models (LLMs) for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in domains like math education. LookAlike utilizes synthetic preference pairs mined from model inconsistencies to optimize error-distractor consistency. The method alternates between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance training stability. Unlike previous approaches relying on heuristics or manually annotated data, LookAlike leverages its own inconsistencies for scalable and stable training. Evaluation on a dataset of over 1,400 math MCQs shows that LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation and 57.2% in error generation, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate distractors for multiple-choice questions (MCQs), especially in domains like math education. However, existing approaches are limited in ensuring that the generated distractors are consistent with common student errors. We propose LookAlike, a method that improves error-distractor consistency via preference optimization. Our two main innovations are: (a) mining synthetic preference pairs from model inconsistencies, and (b) alternating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to stabilize training. Unlike prior work that relies on heuristics or manually annotated preference data, LookAlike uses its own generation inconsistencies as dispreferred samples, thus enabling scalable and stable training. Evaluated on a real-world dataset of 1,400+ math MCQs, LookAlike achieves 51.6% accuracy in distractor generation and 57.2% in error generation under LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, outperforming an existing state-of-the-art method (45.6% / 47.7%). These improvements highlight the effectiveness of preference-based regularization and inconsistency mining for generating consistent math MCQ distractors at scale.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning and generative modeling have driven interest in data-driven molecule discovery pipelines, whereby machine learning (ML) models are used to filter and design novel molecules without requiring prohibitively expensive first-principles simulations. Although the discovery of novel molecules that extend the boundaries of known chemistry requires accurate out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions, ML models often struggle to generalize OOD. Furthermore, there are currently no systematic benchmarks for molecular OOD prediction tasks. We present BOOM, $\boldsymbol{b}$enchmarks for $\boldsymbol{o}$ut-$\boldsymbol{o}$f-distribution $\boldsymbol{m}$olecular property predictions -- a benchmark study of property-based out-of-distribution models for common molecular property prediction models. We evaluate more than 140 combinations of models and property prediction tasks to benchmark deep learning models on their OOD performance. Overall, we do not find any existing models that achieve strong OOD generalization across all tasks: even the top performing model exhibited an average OOD error 3x larger than in-distribution. We find that deep learning models with high inductive bias can perform well on OOD tasks with simple, specific properties. Although chemical foundation models with transfer and in-context learning offer a promising solution for limited training data scenarios, we find that current foundation models do not show strong OOD extrapolation capabilities. We perform extensive ablation experiments to highlight how OOD performance is impacted by data generation, pre-training, hyperparameter optimization, model architecture, and molecular representation. We propose that developing ML models with strong OOD generalization is a new frontier challenge in chemical ML model development. This open-source benchmark will be made available on Github.

Abstract: In this paper, I explored how a range of regression and machine learning techniques can be applied to monthly U.S. unemployment data to produce timely forecasts. I compared seven models: Linear Regression, SGDRegressor, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Support Vector Regression, and an LSTM network, training each on a historical span of data and then evaluating on a later hold-out period. Input features include macro indicators (GDP growth, CPI), labor market measures (job openings, initial claims), financial variables (interest rates, equity indices), and consumer sentiment.
  I tuned model hyperparameters via cross-validation and assessed performance with standard error metrics and the ability to predict the correct unemployment direction. Across the board, tree-based ensembles (and CatBoost in particular) deliver noticeably better forecasts than simple linear approaches, while the LSTM captures underlying temporal patterns more effectively than other nonlinear methods. SVR and SGDRegressor yield modest gains over standard regression but don't match the consistency of the ensemble and deep-learning models.
  Interpretability tools ,feature importance rankings and SHAP values, point to job openings and consumer sentiment as the most influential predictors across all methods. By directly comparing linear, ensemble, and deep-learning approaches on the same dataset, our study shows how modern machine-learning techniques can enhance real-time unemployment forecasting, offering economists and policymakers richer insights into labor market trends.
  In the comparative evaluation of the models, I employed a dataset comprising thirty distinct features over the period from January 2020 through December 2024.

Summary:
The article introduces a new method, Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL), for accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions. By utilizing a multi-task learning framework, the MSGL method combines coarse-scale graph learning with fine-scale graph learning to improve prediction accuracy. The method also introduces cross-scale interpolation learning to establish connections across different spatial scales, enhancing overall model performance. Additionally, the Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL) breaks away from synchronous training approaches.

Abstract: Water temperature can vary substantially even across short distances within the same sub-watershed. Accurate prediction of stream water temperature at fine spatial resolutions (i.e., fine scales, $\leq$ 1 km) enables precise interventions to maintain water quality and protect aquatic habitats. Although spatiotemporal models have made substantial progress in spatially coarse time series modeling, challenges persist in predicting at fine spatial scales due to the lack of data at that scale.To address the problem of insufficient fine-scale data, we propose a Multi-Scale Graph Learning (MSGL) method. This method employs a multi-task learning framework where coarse-scale graph learning, bolstered by larger datasets, simultaneously enhances fine-scale graph learning. Although existing multi-scale or multi-resolution methods integrate data from different spatial scales, they often overlook the spatial correspondences across graph structures at various scales. To address this, our MSGL introduces an additional learning task, cross-scale interpolation learning, which leverages the hydrological connectedness of stream locations across coarse- and fine-scale graphs to establish cross-scale connections, thereby enhancing overall model performance. Furthermore, we have broken free from the mindset that multi-scale learning is limited to synchronous training by proposing an Asynchronous Multi-Scale Graph Learning method (ASYNC-MSGL). Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method for anti-sparse downscaling of daily stream temperatures in the Delaware River Basin, USA, highlighting its potential utility for water resources monitoring and management.

<div> semantic control, LM generations, toxicity, sentiment, politeness

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach for semantic control of language model (LM) generations by leveraging gradient information from a sequence-level verifier. The goal is to steer LM generations towards satisfying non-lexical constraints such as toxicity, sentiment, and politeness. Unlike existing methods that only handle syntactic constraints or rely on ineffective sampling, this approach efficiently reasons over all generated sentences that meet the target attribute. By creating a local LM distribution favoring semantically similar sentences and estimating the probability of satisfying the constraint based on the verifier's evaluation, the method enables precise steering of LM generations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in controlling toxicity, sentiment, and topic adherence of LM generations with a high probability of constraint satisfaction (>95%) while maintaining generation quality. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic control entails steering LM generations towards satisfying subtle non-lexical constraints, e.g., toxicity, sentiment, or politeness, attributes that can be captured by a sequence-level verifier. It can thus be viewed as sampling from the LM distribution conditioned on the target attribute, a computationally intractable problem due to the non-decomposable nature of the verifier. Existing approaches to LM control either only deal with syntactic constraints which cannot capture the aforementioned attributes, or rely on sampling to explore the conditional LM distribution, an ineffective estimator for low-probability events. In this work, we leverage a verifier's gradient information to efficiently reason over all generations that satisfy the target attribute, enabling precise steering of LM generations by reweighing the next-token distribution. Starting from an initial sample, we create a local LM distribution favoring semantically similar sentences. This approximation enables the tractable computation of an expected sentence embedding. We use this expected embedding, informed by the verifier's evaluation at the initial sample, to estimate the probability of satisfying the constraint, which directly informs the update to the next-token distribution. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach in controlling the toxicity, sentiment, and topic-adherence of LMs yielding generations satisfying the constraint with high probability (>95%) without degrading their quality.

In evaluations across 11 regional grids, EnsembleCI outperformed CarbonCast by achieving lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and improving prediction accuracy by an average of 19.58%. Despite some variability across grids due to regional diversity, EnsembleCI demonstrated greater robustness in long-term forecasting. The approach also identified region-specific key features, highlighting its interpretability and practical relevance. The availability of EnsembleCI source code and data provides transparency and reproducibility for further research and industry applications. <div>

Abstract: Carbon intensity (CI) measures the average carbon emissions generated per unit of electricity, making it a crucial metric for quantifying and managing the environmental impact. Accurate CI predictions are vital for minimizing carbon footprints, yet the state-of-the-art method (CarbonCast) falls short due to its inability to address regional variability and lack of adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce EnsembleCI, an adaptive, end-to-end ensemble learning-based approach for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI combines weighted predictions from multiple sublearners, offering enhanced flexibility and regional adaptability. In evaluations across 11 regional grids, EnsembleCI consistently surpasses CarbonCast, achieving the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in almost all grids and improving prediction accuracy by an average of 19.58%. While performance still varies across grids due to inherent regional diversity, EnsembleCI reduces variability and exhibits greater robustness in long-term forecasting compared to CarbonCast and identifies region-specific key features, underscoring its interpretability and practical relevance. These findings position EnsembleCI as a more accurate and reliable solution for CI forecasting.

Summary: <br />
The proposed D3HRL approach addresses challenges in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning by modeling delayed effects as causal relationships and using distributed causal discovery to learn them. It employs conditional independence testing to eliminate spurious correlations and constructs hierarchical policies based on identified causal relationships. Through iterative execution, D3HRL explores the complete causal chain of tasks and demonstrates sensitivity to delay effects. Experimental results in 2D-MineCraft and MiniGrid environments show that D3HRL accurately identifies causal relationships, leading to reliable decision-making in complex scenarios. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) algorithms excel in long-horizon sequential decision-making tasks but still face two challenges: delay effects and spurious correlations. To address them, we propose a causal HRL approach called D3HRL. First, D3HRL models delayed effects as causal relationships across different time spans and employs distributed causal discovery to learn these relationships. Second, it employs conditional independence testing to eliminate spurious correlations. Finally, D3HRL constructs and trains hierarchical policies based on the identified true causal relationships. These three steps are iteratively executed, gradually exploring the complete causal chain of the task. Experiments conducted in 2D-MineCraft and MiniGrid show that D3HRL demonstrates superior sensitivity to delay effects and accurately identifies causal relationships, leading to reliable decision-making in complex environments.

<div> skip connections, self-attention, Vision Transformers, Token Graying, deep architectures <br />
Summary:
The study focuses on the critical role of skip connections in training modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). It notes that self-attention in ViTs requires skip connections for successful training, unlike other components of ViTs. This dependency on skip connections is a recent development, as previous deep architectures like CNNs have performed well without them. The paper theorizes that the self-attention mechanism is inherently unstable and relies on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, the study introduces Token Graying as a simple yet effective method to improve input token conditions. The effectiveness of Token Graying is validated in both supervised and self-supervised training approaches. Overall, the research sheds light on the unique relationship between skip connections, self-attention, and the training of Vision Transformers. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We highlight a curious empirical result within modern Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, self-attention catastrophically fails to train unless it is used in conjunction with a skip connection. This is in contrast to other elements of a ViT that continue to exhibit good performance (albeit suboptimal) when skip connections are removed. Further, we show that this critical dependence on skip connections is a relatively new phenomenon, with previous deep architectures (\eg, CNNs) exhibiting good performance in their absence. In this paper, we theoretically characterize that the self-attention mechanism is fundamentally ill-conditioned and is, therefore, uniquely dependent on skip connections for regularization. Additionally, we propose Token Graying -- a simple yet effective complement (to skip connections) that further improves the condition of input tokens. We validate our approach in both supervised and self-supervised training methods.

<title>Restoring Calibration for Aligned Large Language Models: A Calibration-Aware Fine-Tuning Approach</title>

<div> alignment, Large Language Models, calibration, preference, fine-tuning

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on preference alignment but suffer from poor calibration post-alignment. The issue stems from preference collapse, leading to overconfidence and calibration problems in LLMs. Fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge helps mitigate overconfidence. Models fall into calibratable and non-calibratable regimes based on Expected Calibration Error (ECE) bounds. In the calibratable regime, calibration-aware fine-tuning maintains proper calibration without performance loss. However, as models aim for better performance, they may become non-calibratable, requiring an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization during fine-tuning to manage calibration error. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of these strategies in enhancing calibration in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key technologies for the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) is preference alignment. However, a notable side effect of preference alignment is poor calibration: while the pre-trained models are typically well-calibrated, LLMs tend to become poorly calibrated after alignment with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate why preference alignment affects calibration and how to address this issue. For the first question, we observe that the preference collapse issue in alignment undesirably generalizes to the calibration scenario, causing LLMs to exhibit overconfidence and poor calibration. To address this, we demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning with domain-specific knowledge to alleviate the overconfidence issue. To further analyze whether this affects the model's performance, we categorize models into two regimes: calibratable and non-calibratable, defined by bounds of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). In the calibratable regime, we propose a calibration-aware fine-tuning approach to achieve proper calibration without compromising LLMs' performance. However, as models are further fine-tuned for better performance, they enter the non-calibratable regime. For this case, we develop an EM-algorithm-based ECE regularization for the fine-tuning loss to maintain low calibration error. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting is critical for applications such as weather prediction, and traffic analysis. In addition, the implementation of Transformer variants has improved prediction accuracy. Following these variants, different input data process approaches also enhanced the field, such as tokenization techniques including point-wise, channel-wise, and patch-wise tokenization. However, previous studies still have limitations in time complexity, computational resources, and cross-dimensional interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CNN Autoencoder-based Score Attention mechanism (CASA), which can be introduced in diverse Transformers model-agnosticically by reducing memory and leading to improvement in model performance. Experiments on eight real-world datasets validate that CASA decreases computational resources by up to 77.7%, accelerates inference by 44.0%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 87.5% of evaluated metrics.

Summary: 
Wide & Deep, a recommendation system architecture by Google, combines the strengths of linear and deep models. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are widely used in node classification tasks but face challenges like heterophily and limited expressiveness. In response, a new framework called GCNIII is proposed, integrating Wide & Deep techniques to improve generalization and reduce over-fitting in supervised tasks. The framework incorporates Intersect memory, Initial residual, and Identity mapping to enhance performance across various tasks.

The empirical evidence presented demonstrates the effectiveness of GCNIII in achieving a balanced trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization, making it a promising advancement in graph-based learning systems. The implementation of GCNIII is available for public use on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide & Deep, a simple yet effective learning architecture for recommendation systems developed by Google, has had a significant impact in both academia and industry due to its combination of the memorization ability of generalized linear models and the generalization ability of deep models. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) remain dominant in node classification tasks; however, recent studies have highlighted issues such as heterophily and expressiveness, which focus on graph structure while seemingly neglecting the potential role of node features. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework GCNIII, which leverages the Wide & Deep architecture and incorporates three techniques: Intersect memory, Initial residual and Identity mapping. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that GCNIII can more effectively balance the trade-off between over-fitting and over-generalization on various semi- and full- supervised tasks. Additionally, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for node feature engineering to enhance the performance of GCNIII in cross-domain node classification tasks. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CYCUCAS/GCNIII.

The article introduces NbBench, a benchmark suite for nanobody representation learning, addressing the lack of a unified benchmark in this field. It evaluates eleven models across eight tasks and nine datasets, focusing on structure annotation, binding prediction, and developability assessment. Results show that antibody language models perform well in antigen-related tasks, but struggle with regression tasks like thermostability and affinity. No single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks.

Abstract: Nanobodies, single-domain antibody fragments derived from camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies, exhibit unique advantages such as compact size, high stability, and strong binding affinity, making them valuable tools in therapeutics and diagnostics. While recent advances in pretrained protein and antibody language models (PPLMs and PALMs) have greatly enhanced biomolecular understanding, nanobody-specific modeling remains underexplored and lacks a unified benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce NbBench, the first comprehensive benchmark suite for nanobody representation learning. Spanning eight biologically meaningful tasks across nine curated datasets, NbBench encompasses structure annotation, binding prediction, and developability assessment. We systematically evaluate eleven representative models--including general-purpose protein LMs, antibody-specific LMs, and nanobody-specific LMs--in a frozen setting. Our analysis reveals that antibody language models excel in antigen-related tasks, while performance on regression tasks such as thermostability and affinity remains challenging across all models. Notably, no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. By standardizing datasets, task definitions, and evaluation protocols, NbBench offers a reproducible foundation for assessing and advancing nanobody modeling.

Abstract: Graph In-Context Learning, with the ability to adapt pre-trained graph models to novel and diverse downstream graphs without updating any parameters, has gained much attention in the community. The key to graph in-context learning is to perform downstream graphs conditioned on chosen prompt examples. Existing methods randomly select subgraphs or edges as prompts, leading to noisy graph prompts and inferior model performance. Additionally, due to the gap between pre-training and testing graphs, when the number of classes in the testing graphs is much greater than that in the training, the in-context learning ability will also significantly deteriorate. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we develop a multi-stage adaptive prompt optimization method GraphPrompter, which optimizes the entire process of generating, selecting, and using graph prompts for better in-context learning capabilities. Firstly, Prompt Generator introduces a reconstruction layer to highlight the most informative edges and reduce irrelevant noise for graph prompt construction. Furthermore, in the selection stage, Prompt Selector employs the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and pre-trained selection layers to dynamically choose appropriate samples and minimize the influence of irrelevant prompts. Finally, we leverage a Prompt Augmenter with a cache replacement strategy to enhance the generalization capability of the pre-trained model on new datasets. Extensive experiments show that GraphPrompter effectively enhances the in-context learning ability of graph models. On average across all the settings, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines by over 8%. Our code is released at https://github.com/karin0018/GraphPrompter.

Abstract: DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous measurement of expression levels of thousands of genes, thereby facilitating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as brain tumors and the identification of diagnostic genetic signatures. To derive meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional and complex gene features obtained through this technology and to analyze gene properties in detail, classical AI-based approaches such as machine learning and deep learning are widely employed. However, these methods face various limitations in managing high-dimensional vector spaces and modeling the intricate relationships among genes. In particular, challenges such as hyperparameter tuning, computational costs, and high processing power requirements can hinder their efficiency. To overcome these limitations, quantum computing and quantum AI approaches are gaining increasing attention. Leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, quantum methods enable more efficient parallel processing of high-dimensional data and offer faster and more effective solutions to problems that are computationally demanding for classical methods. In this study, a novel model called "Deep VQC" is proposed, based on the Variational Quantum Classifier approach. Developed using microarray data containing 54,676 gene features, the model successfully classified four different types of brain tumors-ependymoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma-alongside healthy samples with high accuracy. Furthermore, compared to classical ML algorithms, our model demonstrated either superior or comparable classification performance. These results highlight the potential of quantum AI methods as an effective and promising approach for the analysis and classification of complex structures such as brain tumors based on gene expression features.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on neural logistic bandits, aiming to learn an unknown reward function using a neural network within a logistic link function. Existing methods have limitations related to variance and feature dimension dependency. The introduction of a novel Bernstein-type inequality for self-normalized vector-valued martingales enables the derivation of a regret upper bound that grows with the effective dimension rather than the feature dimension. Two proposed algorithms, NeuralLog-UCB-1 and NeuralLog-UCB-2, offer improved regret upper bounds compared to previous approaches. These algorithms guarantee regret upper bounds of order $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{\kappa T})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively. Numerical results on synthetic and real datasets validate the theoretical findings. <div>

Abstract: We study the problem of neural logistic bandits, where the main task is to learn an unknown reward function within a logistic link function using a neural network. Existing approaches either exhibit unfavorable dependencies on $\kappa$, where $1/\kappa$ represents the minimum variance of reward distributions, or suffer from direct dependence on the feature dimension $d$, which can be huge in neural network-based settings. In this work, we introduce a novel Bernstein-type inequality for self-normalized vector-valued martingales that is designed to bypass a direct dependence on the ambient dimension. This lets us deduce a regret upper bound that grows with the effective dimension $\widetilde{d}$, not the feature dimension, while keeping a minimal dependence on $\kappa$. Based on the concentration inequality, we propose two algorithms, NeuralLog-UCB-1 and NeuralLog-UCB-2, that guarantee regret upper bounds of order $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{\kappa T})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\widetilde{d}\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, respectively, improving on the existing results. Lastly, we report numerical results on both synthetic and real datasets to validate our theoretical findings.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As time series classification (TSC) gains prominence, ensuring robust TSC models against adversarial attacks is crucial. While adversarial defense is well-studied in Computer Vision (CV), the TSC field has primarily relied on adversarial training (AT), which is computationally expensive. In this paper, five data augmentation-based defense methods tailored for time series are developed, with the most computationally intensive method among them increasing the computational resources by only 14.07% compared to the original TSC model. Moreover, the deployment process for these methods is straightforward. By leveraging these advantages of our methods, we create two combined methods. One of these methods is an ensemble of all the proposed techniques, which not only provides better defense performance than PGD-based AT but also enhances the generalization ability of TSC models. Moreover, the computational resources required for our ensemble are less than one-third of those required for PGD-based AT. These methods advance robust TSC in data mining. Furthermore, as foundation models are increasingly explored for time series feature learning, our work provides insights into integrating data augmentation-based adversarial defense with large-scale pre-trained models in future research.

The article discusses the importance of world modeling for agents interacting with the physical world and the necessity of learning causal representations. The research focuses on assessing the ability of State Space Model (SSM) architecture in causal discovery compared to Transformer models. Empirical results indicate that SSMs can effectively model environment dynamics and learn causal models simultaneously, potentially outperforming Transformers in certain scenarios. The study opens up opportunities for further exploration into enhancing SSMs with causal awareness, highlighting the advantages of SSMs in capturing causality in world modeling tasks. <div>
arXiv:2505.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: World modelling, i.e. building a representation of the rules that govern the world so as to predict its evolution, is an essential ability for any agent interacting with the physical world. Despite their impressive performance, many solutions fail to learn a causal representation of the environment they are trying to model, which would be necessary to gain a deep enough understanding of the world to perform complex tasks. With this work, we aim to broaden the research in the intersection of causality theory and neural world modelling by assessing the potential for causal discovery of the State Space Model (SSM) architecture, which has been shown to have several advantages over the widespread Transformer. We show empirically that, compared to an equivalent Transformer, a SSM can model the dynamics of a simple environment and learn a causal model at the same time with equivalent or better performance, thus paving the way for further experiments that lean into the strength of SSMs and further enhance them with causal awareness.

<br />Summary: 
The article addresses challenges in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction Demonstration (RLID) due to noisy and sparse demonstration data by introducing data augmentation techniques. The two techniques presented are the Stitched Trajectory Graph (STG) for discovering transitions between demonstration skills and the State Transition Field (STF) for connecting arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood. An Adaptive Trajectory Sampling (ATS) strategy is developed for curriculum generation and a historical encoding mechanism is introduced for memory-dependent skill learning. These enhancements enable more robust skill acquisition that generalizes beyond the demonstrated skills. Extensive experiments across different interaction tasks show significant improvements in convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness compared to existing methods. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We address a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning from Interaction Demonstration (RLID): demonstration noise and coverage limitations. While existing data collection approaches provide valuable interaction demonstrations, they often yield sparse, disconnected, and noisy trajectories that fail to capture the full spectrum of possible skill variations and transitions. Our key insight is that despite noisy and sparse demonstrations, there exist infinite physically feasible trajectories that naturally bridge between demonstrated skills or emerge from their neighboring states, forming a continuous space of possible skill variations and transitions. Building upon this insight, we present two data augmentation techniques: a Stitched Trajectory Graph (STG) that discovers potential transitions between demonstration skills, and a State Transition Field (STF) that establishes unique connections for arbitrary states within the demonstration neighborhood. To enable effective RLID with augmented data, we develop an Adaptive Trajectory Sampling (ATS) strategy for dynamic curriculum generation and a historical encoding mechanism for memory-dependent skill learning. Our approach enables robust skill acquisition that significantly generalizes beyond the reference demonstrations. Extensive experiments across diverse interaction tasks demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence stability, generalization capability, and recovery robustness.

Abstract: Representation learning has become an effective technique utilized by electronic design automation (EDA) algorithms, which leverage the natural representation of workflow elements as images, grids, and graphs. By addressing challenges related to the increasing complexity of circuits and stringent power, performance, and area (PPA) requirements, representation learning facilitates the automatic extraction of meaningful features from complex data formats, including images, grids, and graphs. This paper examines the application of representation learning in EDA, covering foundational concepts and analyzing prior work and case studies on tasks that include timing prediction, routability analysis, and automated placement. Key techniques, including image-based methods, graph-based approaches, and hybrid multimodal solutions, are presented to illustrate the improvements provided in routing, timing, and parasitic prediction. The provided advancements demonstrate the potential of representation learning to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and scalability in current integrated circuit design flows.

<title>GRAIL: Graph Edit Distance and Node Alignment Using LLM-Generated Code</title>

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a widely used metric for measuring similarity between two graphs. Computing the optimal GED is NP-hard, leading to the development of various neural and non-neural heuristics. While neural methods have achieved improved approximation quality compared to non-neural approaches, they face significant challenges: (1) They require large amounts of ground truth data, which is itself NP-hard to compute. (2) They operate as black boxes, offering limited interpretability. (3) They lack cross-domain generalization, necessitating expensive retraining for each new dataset. We address these limitations with GRAIL, introducing a paradigm shift in this domain. Instead of training a neural model to predict GED, GRAIL employs a novel combination of large language models (LLMs) and automated prompt tuning to generate a program that is used to compute GED. This shift from predicting GED to generating programs imparts various advantages, including end-to-end interpretability and an autonomous self-evolutionary learning mechanism without ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments on seven datasets confirm that GRAIL not only surpasses state-of-the-art GED approximation methods in prediction quality but also achieves robust cross-domain generalization across diverse graph distributions.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF. However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed TimeKD.

Abstract: Herb classification presents a critical challenge in botanical research, particularly in regions with rich biodiversity such as Nepal. This study introduces a novel deep learning approach for classifying 60 different herb species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques. Using a manually curated dataset of 12,000 herb images, we developed a robust machine learning model that addresses existing limitations in herb recognition methodologies. Our research employed multiple model architectures, including DenseNet121, 50-layer Residual Network (ResNet50), 16-layer Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG16), InceptionV3, EfficientNetV2, and Vision Transformer (VIT), with DenseNet121 ultimately demonstrating superior performance. Data augmentation and regularization techniques were applied to mitigate overfitting and enhance the generalizability of the model. This work advances herb classification techniques, preserving traditional botanical knowledge and promoting sustainable herb utilization.

<title>Efficient FPGA Implementation of Time-Domain Popcount for Low-Complexity Machine Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02181</link>

Abstract: Population count (popcount) is a crucial operation for many low-complexity machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Tsetlin Machine (TM)-a promising new ML method, particularly well-suited for solving classification tasks. The inference mechanism in TM consists of propositional logic-based structures within each class, followed by a majority voting scheme, which makes the classification decision. In TM, the voters are the outputs of Boolean clauses. The voting mechanism comprises two operations: popcount for each class and determining the class with the maximum vote by means of an argmax operation.
  While TMs offer a lightweight ML alternative, their performance is often limited by the high computational cost of popcount and comparison required to produce the argmax result. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to accelerate and optimize these operations by performing them in the time domain. Our time-domain implementation uses programmable delay lines (PDLs) and arbiters to efficiently manage these tasks through delay-based mechanisms. We also present an FPGA design flow for practical implementation of the time-domain popcount, addressing delay skew and ensuring that the behavior matches that of the model's intended functionality. By leveraging the natural compatibility of the proposed popcount with asynchronous architectures, we demonstrate significant improvements in an asynchronous TM, including up to 38% reduction in latency, 43.1% reduction in dynamic power, and 15% savings in resource utilization, compared to synchronous TMs using adder-based popcount.

<title>DNAZEN: Enhanced Gene Sequence Representations via Mixed Granularities of Coding Units</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02206</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome modeling conventionally treats gene sequence as a language, reflecting its structured motifs and long-range dependencies analogous to linguistic units and organization principles such as words and syntax. Recent studies utilize advanced neural networks, ranging from convolutional and recurrent models to Transformer-based models, to capture contextual information of gene sequence, with the primary goal of obtaining effective gene sequence representations and thus enhance the models' understanding of various running gene samples. However, these approaches often directly apply language modeling techniques to gene sequences and do not fully consider the intrinsic information organization in them, where they do not consider how units at different granularities contribute to representation. In this paper, we propose DNAZEN, an enhanced genomic representation framework designed to learn from various granularities in gene sequences, including small polymers and G-grams that are combinations of several contiguous polymers. Specifically, we extract the G-grams from large-scale genomic corpora through an unsupervised approach to construct the G-gram vocabulary, which is used to provide G-grams in the learning process of DNA sequences through dynamically matching from running gene samples. A Transformer-based G-gram encoder is also proposed and the matched G-grams are fed into it to compute their representations and integrated into the encoder for basic unit (E4BU), which is responsible for encoding small units and maintaining the learning and inference process. To further enhance the learning process, we propose whole G-gram masking to train DNAZEN, where the model largely favors the selection of each entire G-gram to mask rather than an ordinary masking mechanism performed on basic units. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAZEN on various downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability, a form of complete counterfactual identifiability within the Pearl Causal Hierarchy (PCH) framework, ensuring that all Structural Causal Models (SCMs) satisfying the given assumptions provide consistent answers to all causal questions. To simplify this problem, we introduce exogenous isomorphism and propose $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability, reflecting the strength of model identifiability required for $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_3}$-identifiability. We explore sufficient assumptions for achieving $\sim_{\mathrm{EI}}$-identifiability in two special classes of SCMs: Bijective SCMs (BSCMs), based on counterfactual transport, and Triangular Monotonic SCMs (TM-SCMs), which extend $\sim_{\mathcal{L}_2}$-identifiability. Our results unify and generalize existing theories, providing theoretical guarantees for practical applications. Finally, we leverage neural TM-SCMs to address the consistency problem in counterfactual reasoning, with experiments validating both the effectiveness of our method and the correctness of the theory.

Abstract: The Qwen series has emerged as a leading family of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding tasks. With the recent release of Qwen3, which exhibits superior performance across diverse benchmarks, there is growing interest in deploying these models efficiently in resource-constrained environments. Low-bit quantization presents a promising solution, yet its impact on Qwen3's performance remains underexplored. This study conducts a systematic evaluation of Qwen3's robustness under various quantization settings, aiming to uncover both opportunities and challenges in compressing this state-of-the-art model. We rigorously assess 5 existing classic post-training quantization techniques applied to Qwen3, spanning bit-widths from 1 to 8 bits, and evaluate their effectiveness across multiple datasets. Our findings reveal that while Qwen3 maintains competitive performance at moderate bit-widths, it experiences notable degradation in linguistic tasks under ultra-low precision, underscoring the persistent hurdles in LLM compression. These results emphasize the need for further research to mitigate performance loss in extreme quantization scenarios. We anticipate that this empirical analysis will provide actionable insights for advancing quantization methods tailored to Qwen3 and future LLMs, ultimately enhancing their practicality without compromising accuracy. Our project is released on https://github.com/Efficient-ML/Qwen3-Quantization and https://huggingface.co/collections/Efficient-ML/qwen3-quantization-68164450decb1c868788cb2b.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) has achieved remarkable success across various domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and healthcare, by enabling agents to learn complex behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, existing IL methods often face instability challenges, particularly when relying on adversarial reward or value formulations in world model frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that addresses these limitations through a reward model based on random network distillation (RND) for density estimation. Our reward model is built on the joint estimation of expert and behavioral distributions within the latent space of the world model. We evaluate our method across diverse benchmarks, including DMControl, Meta-World, and ManiSkill2, showcasing its ability to deliver stable performance and achieve expert-level results in both locomotion and manipulation tasks. Our approach demonstrates improved stability over adversarial methods while maintaining expert-level performance.

Abstract: Federated causal inference enables multi-site treatment effect estimation without sharing individual-level data, offering a privacy-preserving solution for real-world evidence generation. However, data heterogeneity across sites, manifested in differences in covariate, treatment, and outcome, poses significant challenges for unbiased and efficient estimation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review and theoretical analysis of federated causal effect estimation across both binary/continuous and time-to-event outcomes. We classify existing methods into weight-based strategies and optimization-based frameworks and further discuss extensions including personalized models, peer-to-peer communication, and model decomposition. For time-to-event outcomes, we examine federated Cox and Aalen-Johansen models, deriving asymptotic bias and variance under heterogeneity. Our analysis reveals that FedProx-style regularization achieves near-optimal bias-variance trade-offs compared to naive averaging and meta-analysis. We review related software tools and conclude by outlining opportunities, challenges, and future directions for scalable, fair, and trustworthy federated causal inference in distributed healthcare systems.

Abstract: 3D Geometric Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as transformative tools for modeling molecular data. Despite their predictive power, these models often suffer from limited interpretability, raising concerns for scientific applications that require reliable and transparent insights. While existing methods have primarily focused on explaining molecular substructures in 2D GNNs, the transition to 3D GNNs introduces unique challenges, such as handling the implicit dense edge structures created by a cut-off radius. To tackle this, we introduce a novel explanation method specifically designed for 3D GNNs, which localizes the explanation to the immediate neighborhood of each node within the 3D space. Each node is assigned an radius of influence, defining the localized region within which message passing captures spatial and structural interactions crucial for the model's predictions. This method leverages the spatial and geometric characteristics inherent in 3D graphs. By constraining the subgraph to a localized radius of influence, the approach not only enhances interpretability but also aligns with the physical and structural dependencies typical of 3D graph applications, such as molecular learning.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is pivotal in machine learning, especially for classification tasks, as it improves the robustness and reliability of models. We introduce a novel `Epistemic Wrapping' methodology aimed at improving uncertainty estimation in classification. Our approach uses Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) as a baseline and transforms their outputs into belief function posteriors, effectively capturing epistemic uncertainty and offering an efficient and general methodology for uncertainty quantification. Comprehensive experiments employing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) baseline and an Interval Neural Network for inference on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that our Epistemic Wrapper significantly enhances generalisation and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: We establish a continuous-time framework for analyzing Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) via stochastic control and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). Considering a continuous-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) driven by a square-integrable martingale, we analyze DQN approximation properties. We show that DQNs can approximate the optimal Q-function on compact sets with arbitrary accuracy and high probability, leveraging residual network approximation theorems and large deviation bounds for the state-action process. We then analyze the convergence of a general Q-learning algorithm for training DQNs in this setting, adapting stochastic approximation theorems. Our analysis emphasizes the interplay between DQN layer count, time discretization, and the role of viscosity solutions (primarily for the value function $V^*$) in addressing potential non-smoothness of the optimal Q-function. This work bridges deep reinforcement learning and stochastic control, offering insights into DQNs in continuous-time settings, relevant for applications with physical systems or high-frequency data.

<title>Entropy-Guided Sampling of Flat Modes in Discrete Spaces</title>

Abstract: Sampling from flat modes in discrete spaces is a crucial yet underexplored problem. Flat modes represent robust solutions and have broad applications in combinatorial optimization and discrete generative modeling. However, existing sampling algorithms often overlook the mode volume and struggle to capture flat modes effectively. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Entropic Discrete Langevin Proposal} (EDLP), which incorporates local entropy into the sampling process through a continuous auxiliary variable under a joint distribution. The local entropy term guides the discrete sampler toward flat modes with a small overhead. We provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for EDLP in locally log-concave discrete distributions. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms traditional approaches across tasks that require sampling from flat basins, including Bernoulli distribution, restricted Boltzmann machines, combinatorial optimization, and binary neural networks.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are trained on in-distribution (ID) data but often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs during deployment -- posing serious risks in safety-critical domains. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty, with score thresholds typically set based solely on ID data to achieve a target true positive rate (TPR), since OOD data is limited before deployment. However, these TPR-based thresholds leave false positive rates (FPR) uncontrolled, often resulting in high FPRs where OOD points are misclassified as ID. Moreover, fixed scoring functions and thresholds lack the adaptivity needed to handle newly observed, evolving OOD inputs, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that \emph{safely updates both scoring functions and thresholds on the fly} based on real-world OOD inputs. Our method maximizes TPR while strictly controlling FPR at all times, even as the system adapts over time. We provide theoretical guarantees for FPR control under stationary conditions and present extensive empirical evaluations on OpenOOD benchmarks to demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods by achieving higher TPRs while maintaining FPR control.

Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.

<title>Catastrophic Overfitting, Entropy Gap and Participation Ratio: A Noiseless $l^p$ Norm Solution for Fast Adversarial Training</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02360</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02360</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial training is a cornerstone of robust deep learning, but fast methods like the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) often suffer from Catastrophic Overfitting (CO), where models become robust to single-step attacks but fail against multi-step variants. While existing solutions rely on noise injection, regularization, or gradient clipping, we propose a novel solution that purely controls the $l^p$ training norm to mitigate CO.
  Our study is motivated by the empirical observation that CO is more prevalent under the $l^{\infty}$ norm than the $l^2$ norm. Leveraging this insight, we develop a framework for generalized $l^p$ attack as a fixed point problem and craft $l^p$-FGSM attacks to understand the transition mechanics from $l^2$ to $l^{\infty}$. This leads to our core insight: CO emerges when highly concentrated gradients where information localizes in few dimensions interact with aggressive norm constraints. By quantifying gradient concentration through Participation Ratio and entropy measures, we develop an adaptive $l^p$-FGSM that automatically tunes the training norm based on gradient information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves strong robustness without requiring additional regularization or noise injection, providing a novel and theoretically-principled pathway to mitigate the CO problem.

<title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various tasks, but their large storage and computational requirements constrain their deployment on edge devices. To address this, we propose EntroLLM, a novel compression framework that integrates mixed quantization with entropy coding to reduce storage overhead while maintaining model accuracy. Our method applies a layer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and asymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to optimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless compression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth requirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which enables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring minimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including smolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct, demonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30%$ storage reduction compared to uint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while preserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further show that our method enables $31.9%$ - $146.6%$ faster inference throughput on memory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing the required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional re-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization methods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs.

<title>Connecting Thompson Sampling and UCB: Towards More Efficient Trade-offs Between Privacy and Regret</title>

Abstract: We address differentially private stochastic bandit problems from the angles of exploring the deep connections among Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors, Gaussian mechanisms, and Gaussian differential privacy (GDP). We propose DP-TS-UCB, a novel parametrized private bandit algorithm that enables to trade off privacy and regret. DP-TS-UCB satisfies $ \tilde{O} \left(T^{0.25(1-\alpha)}\right)$-GDP and enjoys an $O \left(K\ln^{\alpha+1}(T)/\Delta \right)$ regret bound, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ controls the trade-off between privacy and regret. Theoretically, our DP-TS-UCB relies on anti-concentration bounds of Gaussian distributions and links exploration mechanisms in Thompson Sampling-based algorithms and Upper Confidence Bound-based algorithms, which may be of independent interest.

<title>Quantitative Analysis of Performance Drop in DeepSeek Model Quantization</title>

arXiv:2505.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there is a high demand for deploying DeepSeek-R1 and V3 locally, possibly because the official service often suffers from being busy and some organizations have data privacy concerns. While single-machine deployment offers infrastructure simplicity, the models' 671B FP8 parameter configuration exceeds the practical memory limits of a standard 8-GPU machine. Quantization is a widely used technique that helps reduce model memory consumption. However, it is unclear what the performance of DeepSeek-R1 and V3 will be after being quantized. This technical report presents the first quantitative evaluation of multi-bitwidth quantization across the complete DeepSeek model spectrum. Key findings reveal that 4-bit quantization maintains little performance degradation versus FP8 while enabling single-machine deployment on standard NVIDIA GPU devices. We further propose DQ3_K_M, a dynamic 3-bit quantization method that significantly outperforms traditional Q3_K_M variant on various benchmarks, which is also comparable with 4-bit quantization (Q4_K_M) approach in most tasks. Moreover, DQ3_K_M supports single-machine deployment configurations for both NVIDIA H100/A100 and Huawei 910B. Our implementation of DQ3\_K\_M is released at https://github.com/UnicomAI/DeepSeek-Eval, containing optimized 3-bit quantized variants of both DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.

<title>Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization in Rejection Sampling and RL</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02391</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02391</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) can be formalized as a latent variable problem, where the model needs to generate intermediate reasoning steps. While prior approaches such as iterative reward-ranked fine-tuning (RAFT) have relied on such formulations, they typically apply uniform inference budgets across prompts, which fails to account for variability in difficulty and convergence behavior. This work identifies the main bottleneck in CoT training as inefficient stochastic gradient estimation due to static sampling strategies. We propose GVM-RAFT, a prompt-specific Dynamic Sample Allocation Strategy designed to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a computational budget constraint. The method dynamically allocates computational resources by monitoring prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, ensuring that the resulting gradient variance is minimized. Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed dynamic sampling strategy leads to accelerated convergence guarantees under suitable conditions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning show that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and considerable accuracy improvements over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is general and can be incorporated into other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as GRPO, leading to similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/GVM.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show how different machine learning tools on the Riemannian manifold $\mathcal{P}_d$ of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices can be united under a probabilistic framework. For this, we will need several Gaussian distributions defined on $\mathcal{P}_d$. We will show how popular classifiers on $\mathcal{P}_d$ can be reinterpreted as Bayes Classifiers using these Gaussian distributions. These distributions will also be used for outlier detection and dimension reduction. By showing that those distributions are pervasive in the tools used on $\mathcal{P}_d$, we allow for other machine learning tools to be extended to $\mathcal{P}_d$.

<title>T2S: High-resolution Time Series Generation with Text-to-Series Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-Time Series generation holds significant potential to address challenges such as data sparsity, imbalance, and limited availability of multimodal time series datasets across domains. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent label sets for ambiguous inputs.

<title>A New Approach to Backtracking Counterfactual Explanations: A Causal Framework for Efficient Model Interpretability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations enhance interpretability by identifying alternative inputs that produce different outputs, offering localized insights into model decisions. However, traditional methods often neglect causal relationships, leading to unrealistic examples. While newer approaches integrate causality, they are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient method based on backtracking counterfactuals that incorporates causal reasoning to generate actionable explanations. We first examine the limitations of existing methods and then introduce our novel approach and its features. We also explore the relationship between our method and previous techniques, demonstrating that it generalizes them in specific scenarios. Finally, experiments show that our method provides deeper insights into model outputs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is an essential function that enables interaction with ubiquitous smart devices. However, in resource-limited devices, KWS models are often static and can thus not adapt to new scenarios, such as added keywords. To overcome this problem, we propose a Continual Learning (CL) approach for KWS built on Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). The framework leverages the reduced computation and memory requirements of BNNs while incorporating techniques that enable the seamless integration of new keywords over time. This study evaluates seven CL techniques on a 16-class use case, reporting an accuracy exceeding 95% for a single additional keyword and up to 86% for four additional classes. Sensitivity to the amount of training samples in the CL phase, and differences in computational complexities are being evaluated. These evaluations demonstrate that batch-based algorithms are more sensitive to the CL dataset size, and that differences between the computational complexities are insignificant. These findings highlight the potential of developing an effective and computationally efficient technique for continuously integrating new keywords in KWS applications that is compatible with resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we explore forgetting in this context, categorizing it into superficial forgetting and essential forgetting. Superficial forgetting refers to cases where the model's knowledge may not be genuinely lost, but its responses to previous tasks deviate from expected formats due to the influence of subsequent tasks' answer styles, making the results unusable. By contrast, essential forgetting refers to situations where the model provides correctly formatted but factually inaccurate answers, indicating a true loss of knowledge. Assessing essential forgetting necessitates addressing superficial forgetting first, as severe superficial forgetting can obscure the model's knowledge state. Hence, we first introduce the Answer Style Diversification (ASD) paradigm, which defines a standardized process for transforming data styles across different tasks, unifying their training sets into similarly diversified styles to prevent superficial forgetting caused by style shifts. Building on this, we propose RegLoRA to mitigate essential forgetting. RegLoRA stabilizes key parameters where prior knowledge is primarily stored by applying regularization, enabling the model to retain existing competencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our overall method, SEFE, achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models on decentralized data. This scheme, however, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, when some of the clients submit corrupted model updates. In real-world scenarios, the total number of compromised clients is typically unknown, with the extent of attacks potentially varying over time. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive approach for robust aggregation of model updates based on Bayesian inference. The mean update is defined by the maximum of the likelihood marginalized over probabilities of each client to be `honest'. As a result, the method shares the simplicity of the classical average estimators (e.g., sample mean or geometric median), being independent of the number of compromised clients. At the same time, it is as effective against attacks as methods specifically tailored to Federated Learning, such as Krum. We compare our approach with other aggregation schemes in federated setting on three benchmark image classification data sets. The proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across various attack types with static and varying number of malicious clients.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in medium-range weather prediction but often fail to maintain physically consistent rollouts beyond 14 days. In contrast, a few atmospheric models demonstrate stability over decades, though the key design choices enabling this remain unclear. This study quantitatively compares the long-term stability of three prominent DL-MWP architectures - FourCastNet, SFNO, and ClimaX - trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at 5.625{\deg} resolution. We systematically assess the impact of autoregressive training steps, model capacity, and choice of prognostic variables, identifying configurations that enable stable 10-year rollouts while preserving the statistical properties of the reference dataset. Notably, rollouts with SFNO exhibit the greatest robustness to hyperparameter choices, yet all models can experience instability depending on the random seed and the set of prognostic variables

arXiv:2505.02514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling is a fundamental tool for understanding drug behaviour across diverse patient populations and enabling personalized dosing strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. A key challenge in PopPK analysis lies in identifying and modelling covariates that influence drug absorption, as these relationships are often complex and nonlinear. Traditional methods may fail to capture hidden patterns within the data. In this study, we propose a data-driven, model-free framework that integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) deep learning model and LASSO regression to uncover key covariates from simulated tacrolimus pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. The VAE compresses high-dimensional PK signals into a structured latent space, achieving accurate reconstruction with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.26%. LASSO regression is then applied to map patient-specific covariates to the latent space, enabling sparse feature selection through L1 regularization. This approach consistently identifies clinically relevant covariates for tacrolimus including SNP, age, albumin, and hemoglobin which are retained across the tested regularization strength levels, while effectively discarding non-informative features. The proposed VAE-LASSO methodology offers a scalable, interpretable, and fully data-driven solution for covariate selection, with promising applications in drug development and precision pharmacotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional domain generalization approaches predominantly focus on leveraging target domain-aware features while overlooking the critical role of source domain-specific characteristics, particularly in federated settings with inherent data isolation. To address this gap, we propose the Federated Source Domain Awareness Framework (FedSDAF), the first method to systematically exploit source domain-aware features for enhanced federated domain generalization (FedDG). The FedSDAF framework consists of two synergistic components: the Domain-Invariant Adapter, which preserves critical domain-invariant features, and the Domain-Aware Adapter, which extracts and integrates source domain-specific knowledge using a Multihead Self-Attention mechanism (MHSA). Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional knowledge distillation mechanism that fosters knowledge sharing among clients while safeguarding privacy. Our approach represents the first systematic exploitation of source domain-aware features, resulting in significant advancements in model generalization capability.Extensive experiments on four standard benchmarks (OfficeHome, PACS, VLCS, and DomainNet) show that our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art federated domain generalization approaches, with accuracy gains of 5.2-13.8%. The source code is available at https://github.com/pizzareapers/FedSDAF.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.

<title>Lazy But Effective: Collaborative Personalized Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Federated Learning, heterogeneity in client data distributions often means that a single global model does not have the best performance for individual clients. Consider for example training a next-word prediction model for keyboards: user-specific language patterns due to demographics (dialect, age, etc.), language proficiency, and writing style result in a highly non-IID dataset across clients. Other examples are medical images taken with different machines, or driving data from different vehicle types. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective personalized federated learning framework (pFedLIA) that utilizes a computationally efficient influence approximation, called `Lazy Influence', to cluster clients in a distributed manner before model aggregation. Within each cluster, data owners collaborate to jointly train a model that captures the specific data patterns of the clients. Our method has been shown to successfully recover the global model's performance drop due to the non-IID-ness in various synthetic and real-world settings, specifically a next-word prediction task on the Nordic languages as well as several benchmark tasks. It matches the performance of a hypothetical Oracle clustering, and significantly improves on existing baselines, e.g., an improvement of 17% on CIFAR100.

Abstract: We introduce Bielik v3, a series of parameter-efficient generative text models (1.5B and 4.5B) optimized for Polish language processing. These models demonstrate that smaller, well-optimized architectures can achieve performance comparable to much larger counterparts while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. Our approach incorporates several key innovations: a custom Polish tokenizer (APT4) that significantly improves token efficiency, Weighted Instruction Cross-Entropy Loss to balance learning across instruction types, and Adaptive Learning Rate that dynamically adjusts based on training progress. Trained on a meticulously curated corpus of 292 billion tokens spanning 303 million documents, these models excel across multiple benchmarks, including the Open PL LLM Leaderboard, Complex Polish Text Understanding Benchmark, Polish EQ-Bench, and Polish Medical Leaderboard. The 4.5B parameter model achieves results competitive with models 2-3 times its size, while the 1.5B model delivers strong performance despite its extremely compact profile. These advances establish new benchmarks for parameter-efficient language modeling in less-represented languages, making high-quality Polish language AI more accessible for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a cornerstone in graph-based data analysis, with applications in diverse domains such as bioinformatics, social networks, and recommendation systems. However, the interplay between model interpretability and robustness remains poorly understood, especially under adversarial scenarios like poisoning and evasion attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark to systematically analyze the impact of various factors on the interpretability of GNNs, including the influence of robustness-enhancing defense mechanisms.
  We evaluate six GNN architectures based on GCN, SAGE, GIN, and GAT across five datasets from two distinct domains, employing four interpretability metrics: Fidelity, Stability, Consistency, and Sparsity. Our study examines how defenses against poisoning and evasion attacks, applied before and during model training, affect interpretability and highlights critical trade-offs between robustness and interpretability. The framework will be published as open source.
  The results reveal significant variations in interpretability depending on the chosen defense methods and model architecture characteristics. By establishing a standardized benchmark, this work provides a foundation for developing GNNs that are both robust to adversarial threats and interpretable, facilitating trust in their deployment in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Federated graph learning is a widely recognized technique that promotes collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) by multi-client graphs.However, existing approaches heavily rely on the communication of model parameters or gradients for federated optimization and fail to adequately address the data heterogeneity introduced by intricate and diverse graph distributions. Although some methods attempt to share additional messages among the server and clients to improve federated convergence during communication, they introduce significant privacy risks and increase communication overhead. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of a condensed graph as a novel optimization carrier to address FGL data heterogeneity and propose a new FGL paradigm called FedGM. Specifically, we utilize a generalized condensation graph consensus to aggregate comprehensive knowledge from distributed graphs, while minimizing communication costs and privacy risks through a single transmission of the condensed data. Extensive experiments on six public datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of FedGM over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting its potential for a novel FGL paradigm.

<title>Towards Cross-Modality Modeling for Time Series Analytics: A Survey in the LLM Era</title>

Abstract: The proliferation of edge devices has generated an unprecedented volume of time series data across different domains, motivating various well-customized methods. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for time series analytics by leveraging the shared sequential nature of textual data and time series. However, a fundamental cross-modality gap between time series and LLMs exists, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. Many recent proposals are designed to address this issue. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLMs-based cross-modality modeling for time series analytics. We first introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into four groups based on the type of textual data employed for time series modeling. We then summarize key cross-modality strategies, e.g., alignment and fusion, and discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on multimodal datasets from different application domains to investigate effective combinations of textual data and cross-modality strategies for enhancing time series analytics. Finally, we suggest several promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Visualizations of the loss landscape in neural networks suggest that minima are isolated points. However, both theoretical and empirical studies indicate that it is possible to connect two different minima with a path consisting of intermediate points that also have low loss. In this study, we propose a new algorithm which investigates low-loss paths in the full parameter space, not only between two minima. Our experiments on LeNet5, ResNet18, and Compact Convolutional Transformer architectures consistently demonstrate the existence of such continuous paths in the parameter space. These results suggest that the low-loss region is a fully connected and continuous space in the parameter space. Our findings provide theoretical insight into neural network over-parameterization, highlighting that parameters collectively define a high-dimensional low-loss space, implying parameter redundancy exists only within individual models and not throughout the entire low-loss space. Additionally, our work also provides new visualization methods and opportunities to improve model generalization by exploring the low-loss space that is closer to the origin.

Abstract: The mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional on the Wasserstein space over $\mathbb{R}^d$, and has gained attention recently as a model for the gradient descent dynamics of interacting particle systems such as infinite-width two-layer neural networks. However, many problems of interest have constrained domains, which are not solved by existing mean-field algorithms due to the global diffusion term. We study the optimization of probability measures constrained to a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ by proposing the \emph{mirror mean-field Langevin dynamics} (MMFLD), an extension of MFLD to the mirror Langevin framework. We obtain linear convergence guarantees for the continuous MMFLD via a uniform log-Sobolev inequality, and uniform-in-time propagation of chaos results for its time- and particle-discretized counterpart.

<title>A Theoretical Analysis of Compositional Generalization in Neural Networks: A Necessary and Sufficient Condition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02627</link>

Abstract: Compositional generalization is a crucial property in artificial intelligence, enabling models to handle novel combinations of known components. While most deep learning models lack this capability, certain models succeed in specific tasks, suggesting the existence of governing conditions. This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition for compositional generalization in neural networks. Conceptually, it requires that (i) the computational graph matches the true compositional structure, and (ii) components encode just enough information in training. The condition is supported by mathematical proofs. This criterion combines aspects of architecture design, regularization, and training data properties. A carefully designed minimal example illustrates an intuitive understanding of the condition. We also discuss the potential of the condition for assessing compositional generalization before training. This work is a fundamental theoretical study of compositional generalization in neural networks.

<title>Aerodynamic and structural airfoil shape optimisation via Transfer Learning-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer learning-enhanced, multi-objective, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on concomitant aerodynamic and structural criteria. To showcase the method, we aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that DRL agents are able to perform multi-objective shape optimisation, that the DRL approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and shape optimisation performance, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial computational resources.

<title>Enhancing Chemical Reaction and Retrosynthesis Prediction with Large Language Model and Dual-task Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02639</link>

Abstract: Chemical reaction and retrosynthesis prediction are fundamental tasks in drug discovery. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in many domains. However, directly applying LLMs to these tasks faces two major challenges: (i) lacking a large-scale chemical synthesis-related instruction dataset; (ii) ignoring the close correlation between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction for the existing fine-tuning strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ChemDual, a novel LLM framework for accurate chemical synthesis. Specifically, considering the high cost of data acquisition for reaction and retrosynthesis, ChemDual regards the reaction-and-retrosynthesis of molecules as a related recombination-and-fragmentation process and constructs a large-scale of 4.4 million instruction dataset. Furthermore, ChemDual introduces an enhanced LLaMA, equipped with a multi-scale tokenizer and dual-task learning strategy, to jointly optimize the process of recombination and fragmentation as well as the tasks between reaction and retrosynthesis prediction. Extensive experiments on Mol-Instruction and USPTO-50K datasets demonstrate that ChemDual achieves state-of-the-art performance in both predictions of reaction and retrosynthesis, outperforming the existing conventional single-task approaches and the general open-source LLMs. Through molecular docking analysis, ChemDual generates compounds with diverse and strong protein binding affinity, further highlighting its strong potential in drug design.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) systems increasingly operate in environments where devices must respond in real time while managing fluctuating resource constraints, including energy and bandwidth. Yet, current approaches often fall short in addressing scenarios where operational constraints evolve over time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Budgeted Multi-Armed Bandit framework tailored for IoT applications with dynamic operational limits. Our model introduces a decaying violation budget, which permits limited constraint violations early in the learning process and gradually enforces stricter compliance over time. We present the Budgeted Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, which adaptively balances performance optimization and compliance with time-varying constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that Budgeted UCB achieves sublinear regret and logarithmic constraint violations over the learning horizon. Extensive simulations in a wireless communication setting show that our approach achieves faster adaptation and better constraint satisfaction than standard online learning methods. These results highlight the framework's potential for building adaptive, resource-aware IoT systems.

Abstract: The Transformer model has shown strong performance in multivariate time series forecasting by leveraging channel-wise self-attention. However, this approach lacks temporal constraints when computing temporal features and does not utilize cumulative historical series effectively.To address these limitations, we propose the Structured Channel-wise Transformer with Cumulative Historical state (SCFormer). SCFormer introduces temporal constraints to all linear transformations, including the query, key, and value matrices, as well as the fully connected layers within the Transformer. Additionally, SCFormer employs High-order Polynomial Projection Operators (HiPPO) to deal with cumulative historical time series, allowing the model to incorporate information beyond the look-back window during prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SCFormer significantly outperforms mainstream baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing time series forecasting. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ShiweiGuo1995/SCFormer

Abstract: Cellular reprogramming, the artificial transformation of one cell type into another, has been attracting increasing research attention due to its therapeutic potential for complex diseases. However, discovering reprogramming strategies through classical wet-lab experiments is hindered by lengthy time commitments and high costs. In this study, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to control Boolean network models of complex biological systems, such as gene regulatory networks and signalling pathway networks. We formulate a novel control problem for Boolean network models under the asynchronous update mode in the context of cellular reprogramming. To facilitate scalability, we consider our previously introduced concept of a pseudo-attractor and we improve our procedure for effective identification of pseudo-attractor states. Finally, we devise a computational framework to solve the control problem. To leverage the structure of biological systems, we incorporate graph neural networks with graph convolutions into the artificial neural network approximator for the action-value function learned by the DRL agent. Experiments on a number of large real-world biological networks from literature demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Addressing the computational challenges inherent in training large-scale deep neural networks remains a critical endeavor in contemporary machine learning research. While previous efforts have focused on enhancing training efficiency through techniques such as gradient descent with momentum, learning rate scheduling, and weight regularization, the demand for further innovation continues to burgeon as model sizes keep expanding. In this study, we introduce a novel framework which diverges from conventional approaches by leveraging long-term time series forecasting techniques. Our method capitalizes solely on initial and final weight values, offering a streamlined alternative for complex model architectures. We also introduce a novel regularizer that is tailored to enhance the forecasting performance of our approach. Empirical evaluations conducted on synthetic weight sequences and real-world deep learning architectures, including the prominent large language model DistilBERT, demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Notably, our framework showcases improved performance while requiring minimal additional computational overhead, thus presenting a promising avenue for accelerating the training process across diverse tasks and architectures.

<title>Knowledge Graphs for Enhancing Large Language Models in Entity Disambiguation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.

<title>Cooperative Bayesian and variance networks disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties</title>

Abstract: Real-world data contains aleatoric uncertainty - irreducible noise arising from imperfect measurements or from incomplete knowledge about the data generation process. Mean variance estimation (MVE) networks can learn this type of uncertainty but require ad-hoc regularization strategies to avoid overfitting and are unable to predict epistemic uncertainty (model uncertainty). Conversely, Bayesian neural networks predict epistemic uncertainty but are notoriously difficult to train due to the approximate nature of Bayesian inference. We propose to cooperatively train a variance network with a Bayesian neural network and demonstrate that the resulting model disentangles aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties while improving the mean estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of this method across a diverse range of datasets, including a time-dependent heteroscedastic regression dataset we created where the aleatoric uncertainty is known. The proposed method is straightforward to implement, robust, and adaptable to various model architectures.

<title>HSplitLoRA: A Heterogeneous Split Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Framework for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, revolutionizing the natural language processing domain and beyond. Due to immense parameter sizes, fine-tuning these models with private data for diverse downstream tasks has become mainstream. Though federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution for fine-tuning LLMs without sharing raw data, substantial computing costs hinder its democratization. Moreover, in real-world scenarios, private client devices often possess heterogeneous computing resources, further complicating LLM fine-tuning. To combat these challenges, we propose HSplitLoRA, a heterogeneous parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework built on split learning (SL) and low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, for efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on heterogeneous client devices. HSplitLoRA first identifies important weights based on their contributions to LLM training. It then dynamically configures the decomposition ranks of LoRA adapters for selected weights and determines the model split point according to varying computing budgets of client devices. Finally, a noise-free adapter aggregation mechanism is devised to support heterogeneous adapter aggregation without introducing noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSplitLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

Abstract: Empirical studies reported that the Hessian matrix of neural networks (NNs) exhibits a near-block-diagonal structure, yet its theoretical foundation remains unclear. In this work, we reveal two forces that shape the Hessian structure: a ``static force'' rooted in the architecture design, and a ``dynamic force'' arisen from training. We then provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of ``static force'' at random initialization. We study linear models and 1-hidden-layer networks with the mean-square (MSE) loss and the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for classification tasks. By leveraging random matrix theory, we compare the limit distributions of the diagonal and off-diagonal Hessian blocks and find that the block-diagonal structure arises as $C \rightarrow \infty$, where $C$ denotes the number of classes. Our findings reveal that $C$ is a primary driver of the near-block-diagonal structure. These results may shed new light on the Hessian structure of large language models (LLMs), which typically operate with a large $C$ exceeding $10^4$ or $10^5$.

Abstract: Understanding the binding specificity between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is central to immunotherapy and vaccine development. However, current predictive models struggle with generalization, especially in data-scarce settings and when faced with novel epitopes. We present LANTERN (Large lAnguage model-powered TCR-Enhanced Recognition Network), a deep learning framework that combines large-scale protein language models with chemical representations of peptides. By encoding TCR \b{eta}-chain sequences using ESM-1b and transforming peptide sequences into SMILES strings processed by MolFormer, LANTERN captures rich biological and chemical features critical for TCR-peptide recognition. Through extensive benchmarking against existing models such as ChemBERTa, TITAN, and NetTCR, LANTERN demonstrates superior performance, particularly in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Our model also benefits from a robust negative sampling strategy and shows significant clustering improvements via embedding analysis. These results highlight the potential of LANTERN to advance TCR-pMHC binding prediction and support the development of personalized immunotherapies.

Abstract: Language models for scientific tasks are trained on text from scientific publications, most distributed as PDFs that require parsing. PDF parsing approaches range from inexpensive heuristics (for simple documents) to computationally intensive ML-driven systems (for complex or degraded ones). The choice of the "best" parser for a particular document depends on its computational cost and the accuracy of its output. To address these issues, we introduce an Adaptive Parallel PDF Parsing and Resource Scaling Engine (AdaParse), a data-driven strategy for assigning an appropriate parser to each document. We enlist scientists to select preferred parser outputs and incorporate this information through direct preference optimization (DPO) into AdaParse, thereby aligning its selection process with human judgment. AdaParse then incorporates hardware requirements and predicted accuracy of each parser to orchestrate computational resources efficiently for large-scale parsing campaigns. We demonstrate that AdaParse, when compared to state-of-the-art parsers, improves throughput by $17\times$ while still achieving comparable accuracy (0.2 percent better) on a benchmark set of 1000 scientific documents. AdaParse's combination of high accuracy and parallel scalability makes it feasible to parse large-scale scientific document corpora to support the development of high-quality, trillion-token-scale text datasets. The implementation is available at https://github.com/7shoe/AdaParse/

<title>Sparsification Under Siege: Defending Against Poisoning Attacks in Communication-Efficient Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy, yet it faces significant challenges in communication efficiency and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. While sparsification techniques mitigate communication overhead by transmitting only critical model parameters, they inadvertently amplify security risks: adversarial clients can exploit sparse updates to evade detection and degrade model performance. Existing defense mechanisms, designed for standard FL communication scenarios, are ineffective in addressing these vulnerabilities within sparsified FL. To bridge this gap, we propose FLARE, a novel federated learning framework that integrates sparse index mask inspection and model update sign similarity analysis to detect and mitigate poisoning attacks in sparsified FL. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that FLARE significantly outperforms existing defense strategies, effectively securing sparsified FL against poisoning attacks while maintaining communication efficiency.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are successful with weather forecasting and have shown progress in climate simulations, yet leveraging them for useful climate predictions needs exploration. Here we show this feasibility using NeuralGCM, a hybrid ML-physics atmospheric model, for seasonal predictions of large-scale atmospheric variability and Northern Hemisphere tropical cyclone (TC) activity. Inspired by physical model studies, we simplify boundary conditions, assuming sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice follow their climatological cycle but persist anomalies present at initialization. With such forcings, NeuralGCM simulates realistic atmospheric circulation and TC climatology patterns. Furthermore, this configuration yields useful seasonal predictions (July-November) for the tropical atmosphere and various TC activity metrics. Notably, the prediction skill for TC frequency in the North Atlantic and East Pacific basins is comparable to existing physical models. These findings highlight the promise of leveraging ML models with physical insights to model TC risks and deliver seamless weather-climate predictions.

Abstract: This paper introduces MoxE, a novel architecture that synergistically combines the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to address critical scalability and efficiency challenges in large language models (LLMs). The proposed method effectively leverages xLSTM's innovative memory structures while strategically introducing sparsity through MoE to substantially reduce computational overhead. At the heart of our approach is a novel entropy-based routing mechanism, designed to dynamically route tokens to specialized experts, thereby ensuring efficient and balanced resource utilization. This entropy awareness enables the architecture to effectively manage both rare and common tokens, with mLSTM blocks being favored to handle rare tokens. To further enhance generalization, we introduce a suite of auxiliary losses, including entropy-based and group-wise balancing losses, ensuring robust performance and efficient training. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations rigorously demonstrate that MoxE achieves significant efficiency gains and enhanced effectiveness compared to existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in scalable LLM architectures.

Abstract: Protecting cloud applications is crucial in an age where security constantly threatens the digital world. The inevitable cyber-attacks throughout the CI/CD pipeline make cloud security innovations necessary. This research is motivated by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodologies, such as Topic Modelling, to analyse cloud security data and predict future attacks. This research aims to use topic modelling, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA). Utilising LDA and PLSA, security-related text data, such as reports, logs, and other relevant documents, will be analysed and sorted into relevant topics (such as phishing or encryption). These algorithms may apply through Python using the Gensim framework. The topics shall be utilised to detect vulnerabilities within relevant CI/CD pipeline records or log data. This application of Topic Modelling anticipates providing a new form of vulnerability detection, improving overall security throughout the CI/CD pipeline.

Abstract: Synthetic video generation with foundation models has gained attention for its realism and wide applications. While these models produce high-quality frames, they often fail to respect common sense and physical laws, resulting in abnormal content. Existing metrics like VideoScore emphasize general quality but ignore such violations and lack interpretability. A more insightful approach is using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as interpretable evaluators, as seen in FactScore. Yet, MLLMs' ability to detect abnormalities in synthetic videos remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce VideoHallu, a benchmark featuring synthetic videos from models like Veo2, Sora, and Kling, paired with expert-designed QA tasks solvable via human-level reasoning across various categories. We assess several SoTA MLLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Qwen-2.5-VL, and newer models like Video-R1 and VideoChat-R1. Despite strong real-world performance on MVBench and MovieChat, these models still hallucinate on basic commonsense and physics tasks in synthetic settings, underscoring the challenge of hallucination. We further fine-tune SoTA MLLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on real and synthetic commonsense/physics data. Results show notable accuracy gains, especially with counterexample integration, advancing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our data is available at https://github.com/zli12321/VideoHallu.

Abstract: Given a text, can we determine whether it was generated by a large language model (LLM) or by a human? A widely studied approach to this problem is watermarking. We propose an undetectable and elementary watermarking scheme in the closed setting. Also, in the harder open setting, where the adversary has access to most of the model, we propose an unremovable watermarking scheme.

<title>The DCR Delusion: Measuring the Privacy Risk of Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data has become an increasingly popular way to share data without revealing sensitive information. Though Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are widely considered the gold standard for empirically assessing the privacy of a synthetic dataset, practitioners and researchers often rely on simpler proxy metrics such as Distance to Closest Record (DCR). These metrics estimate privacy by measuring the similarity between the training data and generated synthetic data. This similarity is also compared against that between the training data and a disjoint holdout set of real records to construct a binary privacy test. If the synthetic data is not more similar to the training data than the holdout set is, it passes the test and is considered private. In this work we show that, while computationally inexpensive, DCR and other distance-based metrics fail to identify privacy leakage. Across multiple datasets and both classical models such as Baynet and CTGAN and more recent diffusion models, we show that datasets deemed private by proxy metrics are highly vulnerable to MIAs. We similarly find both the binary privacy test and the continuous measure based on these metrics to be uninformative of actual membership inference risk. We further show that these failures are consistent across different metric hyperparameter settings and record selection methods. Finally, we argue DCR and other distance-based metrics to be flawed by design and show a example of a simple leakage they miss in practice. With this work, we hope to motivate practitioners to move away from proxy metrics to MIAs as the rigorous, comprehensive standard of evaluating privacy of synthetic data, in particular to make claims of datasets being legally anonymous.

<title>HoneyBee: Efficient Role-based Access Control for Vector Databases via Dynamic Partitioning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01538</link>

Abstract: As vector databases gain traction in enterprise applications, robust access control has become critical to safeguard sensitive data. Access control in these systems is often implemented through hybrid vector queries, which combine nearest neighbor search on vector data with relational predicates based on user permissions. However, existing approaches face significant trade-offs: creating dedicated indexes for each user minimizes query latency but introduces excessive storage redundancy, while building a single index and applying access control after vector search reduces storage overhead but suffers from poor recall and increased query latency. This paper introduces HoneyBee, a dynamic partitioning framework that bridges the gap between these approaches by leveraging the structure of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies. RBAC, widely adopted in enterprise settings, groups users into roles and assigns permissions to those roles, creating a natural "thin waist" in the permission structure that is ideal for partitioning decisions. Specifically, HoneyBee produces overlapping partitions where vectors can be strategically replicated across different partitions to reduce query latency while controlling storage overhead. By introducing analytical models for the performance and recall of the vector search, HoneyBee formulates the partitioning strategy as a constrained optimization problem to dynamically balance storage, query efficiency, and recall. Evaluations on RBAC workloads demonstrate that HoneyBee reduces storage redundancy compared to role partitioning and achieves up to 6x faster query speeds than row-level security (RLS) with only 1.4x storage increase, offering a practical middle ground for secure and efficient vector search.

Abstract: Generative large language models as tools in the legal domain have the potential to improve the justice system. However, the reasoning behavior of current generative models is brittle and poorly understood, hence cannot be responsibly applied in the domains of law and evidence. In this paper, we introduce an approach for creating benchmarks that can be used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. These benchmarks are dynamically varied, scalable in their complexity, and have formally unambiguous interpretations. In this study, we illustrate the approach on the basis of witness testimony, focusing on the underlying argument attack structure. We dynamically generate both linear and non-linear argument attack graphs of varying complexity and translate these into reasoning puzzles about witness testimony expressed in natural language. We show that state-of-the-art large language models often fail in these reasoning puzzles, already at low complexity. Obvious mistakes are made by the models, and their inconsistent performance indicates that their reasoning capabilities are brittle. Furthermore, at higher complexity, even state-of-the-art models specifically presented for reasoning capabilities make mistakes. We show the viability of using a parametrized benchmark with varying complexity to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of generative language models. As such, the findings contribute to a better understanding of the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of generative models, which is essential when designing responsible AI systems in the legal domain.

Abstract: In this work, we seek to understand the performance of large language models in the mechanical engineering domain. We leverage the semantic data found in the ABC dataset, specifically the assembly names that designers assigned to the overall assemblies, and the individual semantic part names that were assigned to each part. After pre-processing the data we developed two unsupervised tasks to evaluate how different model architectures perform on domain-specific data: a binary sentence-pair classification task and a zero-shot classification task. We achieved a 0.62 accuracy for the binary sentence-pair classification task with a fine-tuned model that focuses on fighting over-fitting: 1) modifying learning rates, 2) dropout values, 3) Sequence Length, and 4) adding a multi-head attention layer. Our model on the zero-shot classification task outperforms the baselines by a wide margin, and achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 0.386. The results shed some light on the specific failure modes that arise when learning from language in this domain.

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities, particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Abstract: To accommodate ever-increasing model complexity, modern machine learning (ML) systems have to scale to large GPU clusters. Changes in ML model architecture, ML system implementation, and cluster configuration can significantly affect overall ML system performance. However, quantifying the performance impact before deployment is challenging. Existing performance estimation methods use performance modeling or static workload simulation. These techniques are not general: they requires significant human effort and computation capacity to generate training data or a workload. It is also difficult to adapt ML systems to use these techniques. This paper introduces, Phantora, a live GPU cluster simulator for performance estimation. Phantora runs minimally modified ML models and frameworks, intercepting and simulating GPU-related operations to enable high-fidelity performance estimation. Phantora overcomes several research challenges in integrating an event-driven network simulator with live system execution, and introduces a set of techniques to improve simulation speed, scalability, and accuracy. Our evaluation results show that Phantora can deliver similar estimation accuracy to the state-of-the-art workload simulation approach with only one GPU, while reducing human effort and increasing generalizability.

<title>Structured Prompting and Feedback-Guided Reasoning with LLMs for Data Interpretation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and task generalization. However, their application to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies in schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output, and limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper introduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output Transformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven transformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic alignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight schema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic context construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile of the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured prompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable outputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates a refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based on execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a reasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of adjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is a robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with LLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where interpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.

Abstract: High-throughput neural network inference requires coordinating many optimization decisions, including parallel tiling, microkernel selection, and data layout. The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g., auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites, then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1 CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply, which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.

Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes estimators. Through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while also enabling rapid bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset, where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However, understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width, velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.

Abstract: T-Rex (The Robot for Extracting Leaf Samples) is a gantry-based robotic system developed for autonomous leaf localization, selection, and grasping in greenhouse environments. The system integrates a 6-degree-of-freedom manipulator with a stereo vision pipeline to identify and interact with target leaves. YOLOv8 is used for real-time leaf segmentation, and RAFT-Stereo provides dense depth maps, allowing the reconstruction of 3D leaf masks. These observations are processed through a leaf grasping algorithm that selects the optimal leaf based on clutter, visibility, and distance, and determines a grasp point by analyzing local surface flatness, top-down approachability, and margin from edges. The selected grasp point guides a trajectory executed by ROS-based motion controllers, driving a custom microneedle-equipped end-effector to clamp the leaf and simulate tissue sampling. Experiments conducted with artificial plants under varied poses demonstrate that the T-Rex system can consistently detect, plan, and perform physical interactions with plant-like targets, achieving a grasp success rate of 66.6\%. This paper presents the system architecture, implementation, and testing of T-Rex as a step toward plant sampling automation in Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA).

We show that the brain signals of the subjects can be aligned in this common space during training to form a semantically aligned common brain. This is leveraged to demonstrate that aligning subject-specific lightweight modules to a reference subject is significantly more efficient than traditional end-to-end training methods. Our approach excels in low-data scenarios. We evaluate our methods on different datasets, demonstrating that the common space is subject and dataset-agnostic.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has emerged as a powerful method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, offering a stable and efficient alternative to approaches that use Reinforcement learning via Human Feedback. In this work, we investigate the performance of DPO using open-source preference datasets. One of the major drawbacks of DPO is that it doesn't induce granular scoring and treats all the segments of the responses with equal propensity. However, this is not practically true for human preferences since even "good" responses have segments that may not be preferred by the annotator. To resolve this, a 2-dimensional scoring for DPO alignment called 2D-DPO was proposed. We explore the 2D-DPO alignment paradigm and the advantages it provides over the standard DPO by comparing their win rates. It is observed that these methods, even though effective, are not robust to label/score noise. To counter this, we propose an approach of incorporating segment-level score noise robustness to the 2D-DPO algorithm. Along with theoretical backing, we also provide empirical verification in favour of the algorithm and introduce other noise models that can be present.

Abstract: Neural image compression, necessary in various machine-to-machine communication scenarios, suffers from its heavy encode-decode structures and inflexibility in switching between different compression levels. Consequently, it raises significant challenges in applying the neural image compression to edge devices that are developed for powerful servers with high computational and storage capacities. We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a new transformer-based edge-compute-free image coding framework called Easz. Easz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the heavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a patch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional uniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side through a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational overhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based reconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver side. Extensive evaluations conducted on a real-world testbed demonstrate multiple advantages of Easz over existing compression approaches, in terms of adaptability to different compression levels, computational efficiency, and image reconstruction quality.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer the potential to surpass conventional labeling by generating richer, more detailed descriptions of on-device human behavior understanding (HBU) in low-resolution vision systems, such as depth, thermal, and infrared. However, existing large vision language model (LVLM) approaches are unable to understand low-resolution data well as they are primarily designed for high-resolution data, such as RGB images. A quick fixing approach is to caption a large amount of low-resolution data, but it requires a significant amount of labor-intensive annotation efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel, labor-saving system, Llambda, designed to support low-resolution HBU. The core idea is to leverage limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to guide LLMs in generating informative captions, which can be combined with raw data to effectively fine-tune LVLM models for understanding low-resolution videos in HBU. First, we propose a Contrastive-Oriented Data Labeler, which can capture behavior-relevant information from long, low-resolution videos and generate high-quality pseudo labels for unlabeled data via contrastive learning. Second, we propose a Physical-Knowledge Guided Captioner, which utilizes spatial and temporal consistency checks to mitigate errors in pseudo labels. Therefore, it can improve LLMs' understanding of sequential data and then generate high-quality video captions. Finally, to ensure on-device deployability, we employ LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning to adapt LVLMs for low-resolution data. We evaluate Llambda using a region-scale real-world testbed and three distinct low-resolution datasets, and the experiments show that Llambda outperforms several state-of-the-art LVLM systems up to $40.03\%$ on average Bert-Score.

Abstract: It has been observed by Belkin et al.\ that overparametrized neural networks exhibit a `double descent' phenomenon. That is, as the model complexity, as reflected in the number of features, increases, the training error initially decreases, then increases, and then decreases again. A counterpart of this phenomenon in the time domain has been noted in the context of epoch-wise training, viz., that the training error decreases with time, then increases, then decreases again. This note presents a plausible explanation for this phenomenon by using the theory of two time scale stochastic approximation and singularly perturbed differential equations, applied to the continuous time limit of the gradient dynamics. This adds a `dynamic' angle to an already well studied theme.

Abstract: Biased news reporting poses a significant threat to informed decision-making and the functioning of democracies. This study introduces a novel methodology for scalable, minimally biased analysis of media bias in political news. The proposed approach examines event selection, labeling, word choice, and commission and omission biases across news sources by leveraging natural language processing techniques, including hierarchical topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and ontology learning with large language models. Through three case studies related to current political events, we demonstrate the methodology's effectiveness in identifying biases across news sources at various levels of granularity. This work represents a significant step towards scalable, minimally biased media bias analysis, laying the groundwork for tools to help news consumers navigate an increasingly complex media landscape.

Abstract: Estimating the causal effect of time-varying treatments on survival outcomes is a challenging task in many domains, particularly in medicine where treatment protocols adapt over time. While recent advances in representation learning have improved causal inference for static treatments, extending these methods to dynamic treatment regimes with survival outcomes remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce TV-SurvCaus, a novel framework that extends representation balancing techniques to the time-varying treatment setting for survival analysis. We provide theoretical guarantees through (1) a generalized bound for time-varying precision in estimation of heterogeneous effects, (2) variance control via sequential balancing weights, (3) consistency results for dynamic treatment regimes, (4) convergence rates for representation learning with temporal dependencies, and (5) a formal bound on the bias due to treatment-confounder feedback. Our neural architecture incorporates sequence modeling to handle temporal dependencies while balancing time-dependent representations. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that TV-SurvCaus outperforms existing methods in estimating individualized treatment effects with time-varying covariates and treatments. Our framework advances the field of causal inference by enabling more accurate estimation of treatment effects in dynamic, longitudinal settings with survival outcomes.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of AI-generated texts highlights the urgent need for accurate and transparent detection tools, especially in educational settings, where verifying authorship is essential. Existing literature has demonstrated that the application of stylometric features with machine learning classifiers can yield excellent results. Building on this foundation, this study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates stylometric analysis with psycholinguistic theories, offering a clear and interpretable approach to distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written texts. This research specifically maps 31 distinct stylometric features to cognitive processes such as lexical retrieval, discourse planning, cognitive load management, and metacognitive self-monitoring. In doing so, it highlights the unique psycholinguistic patterns found in human writing.

Abstract: We aim to approximate a continuously differentiable function $u:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ by a composition of functions $f\circ g$ where $g:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq d$, and $f : \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are built in a two stage procedure. For a fixed $g$, we build $f$ using classical regression methods, involving evaluations of $u$. Recent works proposed to build a nonlinear $g$ by minimizing a loss function $\mathcal{J}(g)$ derived from Poincar\'e inequalities on manifolds, involving evaluations of the gradient of $u$. A problem is that minimizing $\mathcal{J}$ may be a challenging task. Hence in this work, we introduce new convex surrogates to $\mathcal{J}$. Leveraging concentration inequalities, we provide sub-optimality results for a class of functions $g$, including polynomials, and a wide class of input probability measures. We investigate performances on different benchmarks for various training sample sizes. We show that our approach outperforms standard iterative methods for minimizing the training Poincar\'e inequality based loss, often resulting in better approximation errors, especially for rather small training sets and $m=1$.

Abstract: Humans and intelligent animals can effortlessly internalize new information ("news") and accurately extract the implications for performing downstream tasks. While large language models (LLMs) can achieve this through in-context learning (ICL) when the news is explicitly given as context, fine-tuning remains challenging for the models to consolidate learning in weights. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{New News}$, a dataset composed of hypothetical yet plausible news spanning multiple domains (mathematics, coding, discoveries, leaderboards, events), accompanied by downstream evaluation questions whose correct answers critically depend on understanding and internalizing the news. We first demonstrate a substantial gap between naive fine-tuning and in-context learning (FT-ICL gap) on our news dataset. To address this gap, we explore a suite of self-play data generation protocols -- paraphrases, implications and Self-QAs -- designed to distill the knowledge from the model with context into the weights of the model without the context, which we term $\textit{System-2 Fine-tuning}$ (Sys2-FT). We systematically evaluate ICL and Sys2-FT performance across data domains and model scales with the Qwen 2.5 family of models. Our results demonstrate that the self-QA protocol of Sys2-FT significantly improves models' in-weight learning of the news. Furthermore, we discover the $\textit{contexual shadowing effect}$, where training with the news $\textit{in context}$ followed by its rephrases or QAs degrade learning of the news. Finally, we show preliminary evidence of an emerging scaling law of Sys2-FT.

Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture is revolutionizing cellular networks with its open, multi-vendor design and AI-driven management, aiming to enhance flexibility and reduce costs. Although it has many advantages, O-RAN is not threat-free. While previous studies have mainly examined vulnerabilities arising from O-RAN's intelligent components, this paper is the first to focus on the security challenges and vulnerabilities introduced by transitioning from single-operator to multi-operator RAN architectures. This shift increases the risk of untrusted third-party operators managing different parts of the network. To explore these vulnerabilities and their potential mitigation, we developed an open-access testbed environment that integrates a wireless network simulator with the official O-RAN Software Community (OSC) RAN intelligent component (RIC) cluster. This environment enables realistic, live data collection and serves as a platform for demonstrating APATE (adversarial perturbation against traffic efficiency), an evasion attack in which a malicious cell manipulates its reported key performance indicators (KPIs) and deceives the O-RAN traffic steering to gain unfair allocations of user equipment (UE). To ensure that O-RAN's legitimate activity continues, we introduce MARRS (monitoring adversarial RAN reports), a detection framework based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder (AE) that learns contextual features across the network to monitor malicious telemetry (also demonstrated in our testbed). Our evaluation showed that by executing APATE, an attacker can obtain a 248.5% greater UE allocation than it was supposed to in a benign scenario. In addition, the MARRS detection method was also shown to successfully classify malicious cell activity, achieving accuracy of 99.2% and an F1 score of 0.978.

Abstract: Edge-cloud collaborative computing (ECCC) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for addressing the computational demands of modern intelligent applications, integrating cloud resources with edge devices to enable efficient, low-latency processing. Recent advancements in AI, particularly deep learning and large language models (LLMs), have dramatically enhanced the capabilities of these distributed systems, yet introduce significant challenges in model deployment and resource management. In this survey, we comprehensive examine the intersection of distributed intelligence and model optimization within edge-cloud environments, providing a structured tutorial on fundamental architectures, enabling technologies, and emerging applications. Additionally, we systematically analyze model optimization approaches, including compression, adaptation, and neural architecture search, alongside AI-driven resource management strategies that balance performance, energy efficiency, and latency requirements. We further explore critical aspects of privacy protection and security enhancement within ECCC systems and examines practical deployments through diverse applications, spanning autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. Performance analysis and benchmarking techniques are also thoroughly explored to establish evaluation standards for these complex systems. Furthermore, the review identifies critical research directions including LLMs deployment, 6G integration, neuromorphic computing, and quantum computing, offering a roadmap for addressing persistent challenges in heterogeneity management, real-time processing, and scalability. By bridging theoretical advancements and practical deployments, this survey offers researchers and practitioners a holistic perspective on leveraging AI to optimize distributed computing environments, fostering innovation in next-generation intelligent systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm for solving planning and learning problems of Markov decision processes. The proposed algorithm follows a policy iteration-type update by using a rank-one approximation of the transition probability matrix in the policy evaluation step. This rank-one approximation is closely related to the stationary distribution of the corresponding transition probability matrix, which is approximated using the power method. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the proposed algorithm to optimal (action-)value function with the same rate and computational complexity as the value iteration algorithm in the planning problem and as the Q-learning algorithm in the learning problem. Through our extensive numerical simulations, however, we show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms first-order algorithms and their accelerated versions for both planning and learning problems.

<title>Bayesian learning of the optimal action-value function in a Markov decision process</title>

Abstract: The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular framework for sequential decision-making problems, and uncertainty quantification is an essential component of it to learn optimal decision-making strategies. In particular, a Bayesian framework is used to maintain beliefs about the optimal decisions and the unknown ingredients of the model, which are also to be learned from the data, such as the rewards and state dynamics. However, many existing Bayesian approaches for learning the optimal decision-making strategy are based on unrealistic modelling assumptions and utilise approximate inference techniques. This raises doubts whether the benefits of Bayesian uncertainty quantification are fully realised or can be relied upon.
  We focus on infinite-horizon and undiscounted MDPs, with finite state and action spaces, and a terminal state. We provide a full Bayesian framework, from modelling to inference to decision-making. For modelling, we introduce a likelihood function with minimal assumptions for learning the optimal action-value function based on Bellman's optimality equations, analyse its properties, and clarify connections to existing works. For deterministic rewards, the likelihood is degenerate and we introduce artificial observation noise to relax it, in a controlled manner, to facilitate more efficient Monte Carlo-based inference. For inference, we propose an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to both sample from and adjust the sequence of relaxed posterior distributions. For decision-making, we choose actions using samples from the posterior distribution over the optimal strategies. While commonly done, we provide new insight that clearly shows that it is a generalisation of Thompson sampling from multi-arm bandit problems. Finally, we evaluate our framework on the Deep Sea benchmark problem and demonstrate the exploration benefits of posterior sampling in MDPs.

<title>PQS-BFL: A Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning Framework</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, but its classical cryptographic underpinnings are vulnerable to quantum attacks. This vulnerability is particularly critical in sensitive domains like healthcare. This paper introduces PQS-BFL (Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning), a framework integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with blockchain verification to secure FL against quantum adversaries. We employ ML-DSA-65 (a FIPS 204 standard candidate, formerly Dilithium) signatures to authenticate model updates and leverage optimized smart contracts for decentralized validation. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets (MNIST, SVHN, HAR) demonstrate that PQS-BFL achieves efficient cryptographic operations (average PQC sign time: 0.65 ms, verify time: 0.53 ms) with a fixed signature size of 3309 Bytes. Blockchain integration incurs a manageable overhead, with average transaction times around 4.8 s and gas usage per update averaging 1.72 x 10^6 units for PQC configurations. Crucially, the cryptographic overhead relative to transaction time remains minimal (around 0.01-0.02% for PQC with blockchain), confirming that PQC performance is not the bottleneck in blockchain-based FL. The system maintains competitive model accuracy (e.g., over 98.8% for MNIST with PQC) and scales effectively, with round times showing sublinear growth with increasing client numbers. Our open-source implementation and reproducible benchmarks validate the feasibility of deploying long-term, quantum-resistant security in practical FL systems.

Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.

<title>Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Models for Inland Water Body Segmentation from SAR Images</title>

Abstract: Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images, differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice, manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial examples for robust training, are publicly available. (Github link - https://github.com/GVCL/IWSeg-SAR-Poison.git)

<title>Discrete Spatial Diffusion: Intensity-Preserving Diffusion Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in producing high-quality images. However, because these models typically operate in continuous intensity spaces - diffusing independently per pixel and color channel - they are fundamentally ill-suited for applications where quantities such as particle counts or material units are inherently discrete and governed by strict conservation laws such as mass preservation, limiting their applicability in scientific workflows. To address this limitation, we propose Discrete Spatial Diffusion (DSD), a framework based on a continuous-time, discrete-state jump stochastic process that operates directly in discrete spatial domains while strictly preserving mass in both forward and reverse diffusion processes. By using spatial diffusion to achieve mass preservation, we introduce stochasticity naturally through a discrete formulation. We demonstrate the expressive flexibility of DSD by performing image synthesis, class conditioning, and image inpainting across widely-used image benchmarks, with the ability to condition on image intensity. Additionally, we highlight its applicability to domain-specific scientific data for materials microstructure, bridging the gap between diffusion models and mass-conditioned scientific applications.

<title>Faster logconcave sampling from a cold start in high dimension</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We present a faster algorithm to generate a warm start for sampling an arbitrary logconcave density specified by an evaluation oracle, leading to the first sub-cubic sampling algorithms for inputs in (near-)isotropic position. A long line of prior work incurred a warm-start penalty of at least linear in the dimension, hitting a cubic barrier, even for the special case of uniform sampling from convex bodies.
  Our improvement relies on two key ingredients of independent interest. (1) We show how to sample given a warm start in weaker notions of distance, in particular $q$-R\'enyi divergence for $q=\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, whereas previous analyses required stringent $\infty$-R\'enyi divergence (with the exception of Hit-and-Run, whose known mixing time is higher). This marks the first improvement in the required warmness since Lov\'asz and Simonovits (1991). (2) We refine and generalize the log-Sobolev inequality of Lee and Vempala (2018), originally established for isotropic logconcave distributions in terms of the diameter of the support, to logconcave distributions in terms of a geometric average of the support diameter and the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.

<title>Runtime Anomaly Detection for Drones: An Integrated Rule-Mining and Unsupervised-Learning Approach</title>

arXiv:2505.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UAVs, commonly referred to as drones, have witnessed a remarkable surge in popularity due to their versatile applications. These cyber-physical systems depend on multiple sensor inputs, such as cameras, GPS receivers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, with faults potentially leading to physical instability and serious safety concerns. To mitigate such risks, anomaly detection has emerged as a crucial safeguarding mechanism, capable of identifying the physical manifestations of emerging issues and allowing operators to take preemptive action at runtime. Recent anomaly detection methods based on LSTM neural networks have shown promising results, but three challenges persist: the need for models that can generalise across the diverse mission profiles of drones; the need for interpretability, enabling operators to understand the nature of detected problems; and the need for capturing domain knowledge that is difficult to infer solely from log data. Motivated by these challenges, this paper introduces RADD, an integrated approach to anomaly detection in drones that combines rule mining and unsupervised learning. In particular, we leverage rules (or invariants) to capture expected relationships between sensors and actuators during missions, and utilise unsupervised learning techniques to cover more subtle relationships that the rules may have missed. We implement this approach using the ArduPilot drone software in the Gazebo simulator, utilising 44 rules derived across the main phases of drone missions, in conjunction with an ensemble of five unsupervised learning models. We find that our integrated approach successfully detects 93.84% of anomalies over six types of faults with a low false positive rate (2.33%), and can be deployed effectively at runtime. Furthermore, RADD outperforms a state-of-the-art LSTM-based method in detecting the different types of faults evaluated in our study.

Abstract: Modular self-reconfigurable satellites refer to satellite clusters composed of individual modular units capable of altering their configurations. The configuration changes enable the execution of diverse tasks and mission objectives. Existing path planning algorithms for reconfiguration often suffer from high computational complexity, poor generalization capability, and limited support for diverse target configurations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a goal-oriented reinforcement learning-based path planning algorithm. This algorithm is the first to address the challenge that previous reinforcement learning methods failed to overcome, namely handling multiple target configurations. Moreover, techniques such as Hindsight Experience Replay and Invalid Action Masking are incorporated to overcome the significant obstacles posed by sparse rewards and invalid actions. Based on these designs, our model achieves a 95% and 73% success rate in reaching arbitrary target configurations in a modular satellite cluster composed of four and six units, respectively.

Abstract: We can approximate a constraint or an objective function that is uncertain or nonlinear with a neural network that we embed in the optimization model. This approach, which is known as constraint learning, faces the challenge that optimization models with neural network surrogates are harder to solve. Such difficulties have motivated studies on model reformulation, specialized optimization algorithms, and - to a lesser extent - pruning of the embedded networks. In this work, we double down on the use of surrogates by applying network pruning to produce a surrogate of the neural network itself. In the context of using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver to verify neural networks, we obtained faster adversarial perturbations for dense neural networks by using sparse surrogates, especially - and surprisingly - if not taking the time to finetune the sparse network to make up for the loss in accuracy. In other words, we show that a pruned network with bad classification performance can still be a good - and more efficient - surrogate.

Abstract: Individual treatment effect estimation has gained significant attention in recent data science literature. This work introduces the Double Neural Network (Double-NN) method to address this problem within the framework of extended fiducial inference (EFI). In the proposed method, deep neural networks are used to model the treatment and control effect functions, while an additional neural network is employed to estimate their parameters. The universal approximation capability of deep neural networks ensures the broad applicability of this method. Numerical results highlight the superior performance of the proposed Double-NN method compared to the conformal quantile regression (CQR) method in individual treatment effect estimation. From the perspective of statistical inference, this work advances the theory and methodology for statistical inference of large models. Specifically, it is theoretically proven that the proposed method permits the model size to increase with the sample size $n$ at a rate of $O(n^{\zeta})$ for some $0 \leq \zeta<1$, while still maintaining proper quantification of uncertainty in the model parameters. This result marks a significant improvement compared to the range $0\leq \zeta < \frac{1}{2}$ required by the classical central limit theorem. Furthermore, this work provides a rigorous framework for quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks under the neural scaling law, representing a substantial contribution to the statistical understanding of large-scale neural network models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become integral to various real-world applications, leveraging massive, web-sourced datasets like Common Crawl, C4, and FineWeb for pretraining. While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. Upon publishing, we will also opensource our model signal on the entire C4 dataset. Our work offers insights into ensuring safer LLM pretraining and serves as a resource for Responsible AI (RAI) compliance.

Abstract: Recent progress in Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) has demonstrated that using RL to learn a meta-level policy for dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) over an optimization task distribution could significantly enhance the performance of the low-level BBO algorithm. However, the online learning paradigms in existing works makes the efficiency of MetaBBO problematic. To address this, we propose an offline learning-based MetaBBO framework in this paper, termed Q-Mamba, to attain both effectiveness and efficiency in MetaBBO. Specifically, we first transform DAC task into long-sequence decision process. This allows us further introduce an effective Q-function decomposition mechanism to reduce the learning difficulty within the intricate algorithm configuration space. Under this setting, we propose three novel designs to meta-learn DAC policy from offline data: we first propose a novel collection strategy for constructing offline DAC experiences dataset with balanced exploration and exploitation. We then establish a decomposition-based Q-loss that incorporates conservative Q-learning to promote stable offline learning from the offline dataset. To further improve the offline learning efficiency, we equip our work with a Mamba architecture which helps long-sequence learning effectiveness and efficiency by selective state model and hardware-aware parallel scan respectively. Through extensive benchmarking, we observe that Q-Mamba achieves competitive or even superior performance to prior online/offline baselines, while significantly improving the training efficiency of existing online baselines. We provide sourcecodes of Q-Mamba at https://github.com/MetaEvo/Q-Mamba.

Abstract: Since the advent of the ``Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)'' paper, learning ODEs with deep learning has been applied to system identification, time-series forecasting, and related areas. Exploiting the diffeomorphic nature of ODE solution maps, neural ODEs has also enabled their use in generative modeling. Despite the rich potential to incorporate various kinds of physical information, training Neural ODEs remains challenging in practice. This study demonstrates, through the simplest one-dimensional linear model, why training Neural ODEs is difficult. We then propose a new stabilization method and provide an analytical convergence analysis. The insights and techniques presented here serve as a concise tutorial for researchers beginning work on Neural ODEs.

<title>Handling Imbalanced Pseudolabels for Vision-Language Models with Concept Alignment and Confusion-Aware Calibrated Margin</title>

Abstract: Adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks with pseudolabels has gained increasing attention. A major obstacle is that the pseudolabels generated by VLMs tend to be imbalanced, leading to inferior performance. While existing methods have explored various strategies to address this, the underlying causes of imbalance remain insufficiently investigated. To fill this gap, we delve into imbalanced pseudolabels and identify two primary contributing factors: concept mismatch and concept confusion. To mitigate these two issues, we propose a novel framework incorporating concept alignment and confusion-aware calibrated margin mechanisms. The core of our approach lies in enhancing underperforming classes and promoting balanced predictions across categories, thus mitigating imbalance. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets with three learning paradigms demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the accuracy and balance of pseudolabels, achieving a relative improvement of 6.29% over the SoTA method.

Abstract: We propose the Compact Clustering Attention (COCA) layer, an effective building block that introduces a hierarchical strategy for object-centric representation learning, while solving the unsupervised object discovery task on single images. COCA is an attention-based clustering module capable of extracting object-centric representations from multi-object scenes, when cascaded into a bottom-up hierarchical network architecture, referred to as COCA-Net. At its core, COCA utilizes a novel clustering algorithm that leverages the physical concept of compactness, to highlight distinct object centroids in a scene, providing a spatial inductive bias. Thanks to this strategy, COCA-Net generates high-quality segmentation masks on both the decoder side and, notably, the encoder side of its pipeline. Additionally, COCA-Net is not bound by a predetermined number of object masks that it generates and handles the segmentation of background elements better than its competitors. We demonstrate COCA-Net's segmentation performance on six widely adopted datasets, achieving superior or competitive results against the state-of-the-art models across nine different evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) are large-scale, pre-trained models that serve as general-purpose backbones for various computer vision tasks. As VFMs' popularity grows, there is an increasing interest in understanding their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks. However, VFMs typically produce low-resolution features, limiting their direct applicability in this context. One way to tackle this limitation is by employing a task-agnostic feature upsampling module that refines VFM features resolution. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we investigate Interactive Segmentation (IS) as a novel benchmark for evaluating feature upsampling methods on VFMs. Due to its inherent multimodal input, consisting of an image and a set of user-defined clicks, as well as its dense mask output, IS creates a challenging environment that demands comprehensive visual scene understanding. Our benchmarking experiments show that selecting appropriate upsampling strategies significantly improves VFM features quality. The code is released at https://github.com/havrylovv/iSegProbe

Abstract: Solving non-convex resource allocation problems poses significant challenges in wireless communication systems, often beyond the capability of traditional optimization techniques. To address this issue, we propose LLM-OptiRA, the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect and transform non-convex components into solvable forms, enabling fully automated resolution of non-convex resource allocation problems in wireless communication systems. LLM-OptiRA not only simplifies problem-solving by reducing reliance on expert knowledge, but also integrates error correction and feasibility validation mechanisms to ensure robustness. Experimental results show that LLM-OptiRA achieves an execution rate of 96% and a success rate of 80% on GPT-4, significantly outperforming baseline approaches in complex optimization tasks across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a powerful tool for many machine learning problems, such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Estimating hypergradients (also known as implicit gradients) is crucial for developing gradient-based methods for bilevel optimization. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient technique for incorporating curvature information into the approximation of hypergradients and present a novel algorithmic framework based on the resulting enhanced hypergradient computation. We provide convergence rate guarantees for the proposed framework in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios, particularly showing improved computational complexity over popular gradient-based methods in the deterministic setting. This improvement in complexity arises from a careful exploitation of the hypergradient structure and the inexact Newton method. In addition to the theoretical speedup, numerical experiments demonstrate the significant practical performance benefits of incorporating curvature information.

<title>QiMeng-Xpiler: Transcompiling Tensor Programs for Deep Learning Systems with a Neural-Symbolic Approach</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneous deep learning systems (DLS) such as GPUs and ASICs have been widely deployed in industrial data centers, which requires to develop multiple low-level tensor programs for different platforms. An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question.
  We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.

Abstract: Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach

Abstract: Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.

Abstract: Time series clustering is an unsupervised learning method for classifying time series data into groups with similar behavior. It is used in applications such as healthcare, finance, economics, energy, and climate science. Several time series clustering methods have been introduced and used for over four decades. Most of them focus on measuring either Euclidean distances or association dissimilarities between time series. In this work, we propose a new dissimilarity measure called ranked Pearson correlation dissimilarity (RDPC), which combines a weighted average of a specified fraction of the largest element-wise differences with the well-known Pearson correlation dissimilarity. It is incorporated into hierarchical clustering. The performance is evaluated and compared with existing clustering algorithms. The results show that the RDPC algorithm outperforms others in complicated cases involving different seasonal patterns, trends, and peaks. Finally, we demonstrate our method by clustering a random sample of customers from a Thai electricity consumption time series dataset into seven groups with unique characteristics.

Abstract: We revisit the Bayesian Black-Litterman (BL) portfolio model and remove its reliance on subjective investor views. Classical BL requires an investor "view": a forecast vector $q$ and its uncertainty matrix $\Omega$ that describe how much a chosen portfolio should outperform the market. Our key idea is to treat $(q,\Omega)$ as latent variables and learn them from market data within a single Bayesian network. Consequently, the resulting posterior estimation admits closed-form expression, enabling fast inference and stable portfolio weights. Building on these, we propose two mechanisms to capture how features interact with returns: shared-latent parametrization and feature-influenced views; both recover classical BL and Markowitz portfolios as special cases. Empirically, on 30-year Dow-Jones and 20-year sector-ETF data, we improve Sharpe ratios by 50% and cut turnover by 55% relative to Markowitz and the index baselines. This work turns BL into a fully data-driven, view-free, and coherent Bayesian framework for portfolio optimization.

Abstract: A decision tree is an easy-to-understand tool that has been widely used for classification tasks. On the one hand, due to privacy concerns, there has been an urgent need to create privacy-preserving classifiers that conceal the user's input from the classifier. On the other hand, with the rise of cloud computing, data owners are keen to reduce risk by outsourcing their model, but want security guarantees that third parties cannot steal their decision tree model. To address these issues, Joye and Salehi introduced a theoretical protocol that efficiently evaluates decision trees while maintaining privacy by leveraging their comparison protocol that is resistant to timing attacks. However, their approach was not only inefficient but also prone to side-channel attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new decision tree inference protocol in which the model is shared and evaluated among multiple entities. We partition our decision tree model by each level to be stored in a new entity we refer to as a "level-site." Utilizing this approach, we were able to gain improved average run time for classifier evaluation for a non-complete tree, while also having strong mitigations against side-channel attacks.

Abstract: Building models responsive to input prompts represents a transformative shift in machine learning. This paradigm holds significant potential for robotics problems, such as targeted manipulation amidst clutter. In this work, we present a novel approach to combine promptable foundation models with reinforcement learning (RL), enabling robots to perform dexterous manipulation tasks in a prompt-responsive manner. Existing methods struggle to link high-level commands with fine-grained dexterous control. We address this gap with a memory-augmented student-teacher learning framework. We use the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM 2) model as a perception backbone to infer an object of interest from user prompts. While detections are imperfect, their temporal sequence provides rich information for implicit state estimation by memory-augmented models. Our approach successfully learns prompt-responsive policies, demonstrated in picking objects from cluttered scenes. Videos and code are available at https://memory-student-teacher.github.io

Abstract: We propose a design principle for the learning circuits of the biological brain. The principle states that almost any dendritic weights updated via heterosynaptic plasticity can implement a generalized and efficient class of gradient-based meta-learning. The theory suggests that a broad class of biologically plausible learning algorithms, together with the standard machine learning optimizers, can be grounded in heterosynaptic circuit motifs. This principle suggests that the phenomenology of (anti-) Hebbian (HBP) and heterosynaptic plasticity (HSP) may emerge from the same underlying dynamics, thus providing a unifying explanation. It also suggests an alternative perspective of neuroplasticity, where HSP is promoted to the primary learning and memory mechanism, and HBP is an emergent byproduct. We present simulations that show that (a) HSP can explain the metaplasticity of neurons, (b) HSP can explain the flexibility of the biology circuits, and (c) gradient learning can arise quickly from simple evolutionary dynamics that do not compute any explicit gradient. While our primary focus is on biology, the principle also implies a new approach to designing AI training algorithms and physically learnable AI hardware. Conceptually, our result demonstrates that contrary to the common belief, gradient computation may be extremely easy and common in nature.

Abstract: In regions lacking medically certified causes of death, verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical and widely used tool to ascertain the cause of death through interviews with caregivers. Data collected by VAs are often analyzed using probabilistic algorithms. The performance of these algorithms often degrades due to distributional shift across populations. Most existing VA algorithms rely on centralized training, requiring full access to training data for joint modeling. This is often infeasible due to privacy and logistical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL) framework that avoids data sharing across multiple training sources. Our method enables reliable individual-level cause-of-death classification and population-level quantification of cause-specific mortality fractions (CSMFs), in a target domain with limited or no local labeled data. The proposed framework is modular, computationally efficient, and compatible with a wide range of existing VA algorithms as candidate models, facilitating flexible deployment in real-world mortality surveillance systems. We validate the performance of BFL through extensive experiments on two real-world VA datasets under varying levels of distribution shift. Our results show that BFL significantly outperforms the base models built on a single domain and achieves comparable or better performance compared to joint modeling.

Abstract: Dielectric response (DR) of insulating materials is key input information for designing electrical insulation systems and defining safe operating conditions of various HV devices. In dielectric materials, different polarization and conduction processes occur at different time scales, making it challenging to physically interpret raw measured data. To analyze DR measurement results, equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are commonly used, reducing the complexity of the physical system to a number of circuit elements that capture the dominant response. This paper examines the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inverse modeling of DR in time domain using parallel RC circuits. To assess their performance, we test PINNs on synthetic data generated from analytical solutions of corresponding ECMs, incorporating Gaussian noise to simulate measurement errors. Our results show that PINNs are highly effective at solving well-conditioned inverse problems, accurately estimating up to five unknown RC parameters with minimal requirements on neural network size, training duration, and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we extend the ECMs to incorporate temperature dependence and demonstrate that PINNs can accurately recover embedded, nonlinear temperature functions from noisy DR data sampled at different temperatures. This case study in modeling DR in time domain presents a solution with wide-ranging potential applications in disciplines relying on ECMs, utilizing the latest technology in machine learning for scientific computation.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for encoding integers using smooth real-valued functions whose integral properties implicitly reflect discrete quantities. In contrast to classical representations, where the integer appears as an explicit parameter, our approach encodes the number N in the set of natural numbers through the cumulative balance of a smooth function f_N(t), constructed from localized Gaussian bumps with alternating and decaying coefficients. The total integral I(N) converges to zero as N tends to infinity, and the integer can be recovered as the minimal point of near-cancellation.
  This method enables continuous and differentiable representations of discrete states, supports recovery through spline-based or analytical inversion, and extends naturally to multidimensional tuples (N1, N2, ...). We analyze the structure and convergence of the encoding series, demonstrate numerical construction of the integral map I(N), and develop procedures for integer recovery via numerical inversion. The resulting framework opens a path toward embedding discrete logic within continuous optimization pipelines, machine learning architectures, and smooth symbolic computation.

Abstract: Embedding layers in transformer-based NLP models typically account for the largest share of model parameters, scaling with vocabulary size but not yielding performance gains proportional to scale. We propose an alternative approach in which token embedding vectors are first generated deterministically, directly from the token IDs using a Fourier expansion of their normalized values, followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) that captures higher-order interactions. We train standard transformers and our architecture on natural language inference tasks (SNLI and MNLI), and evaluate zero-shot performance on sentence textual similarity (STS-B). Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance using significantly fewer parameters, trains faster, and operates effectively without the need for dropout. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential for scalable, memory-efficient language models and motivates further large-scale experimentation based on our findings.

Abstract: This study explores the performance of a random Gaussian smoothing zeroth-order (ZO) scheme for minimising quasar-convex (QC) and strongly quasar-convex (SQC) functions in both unconstrained and constrained settings. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the ZO algorithm's convergence to a global minimum along with its complexity when applied to both QC and SQC functions. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal-quasar-convexity and prove analogous results to the unconstrained case. Specifically, we show the complexity bounds and the convergence of the algorithm to a neighbourhood of a global minimum whose size can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme. Theoretical findings are illustrated through investigating the performance of the algorithm applied to a range of problems in machine learning and optimisation. Specifically, we observe scenarios where the ZO method outperforms gradient descent. We provide a possible explanation for this phenomenon.

Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has exposed the inefficiency of conventional von Neumann architectures, where frequent data transfers between compute units and memory create significant energy and latency bottlenecks. Analog Computing-in-Memory (ACIM) addresses this challenge by performing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations directly in the memory arrays, substantially reducing data movement. However, designing robust ACIM accelerators requires accurate modeling of device- and circuit-level non-idealities. In this work, we present NeuroSim V1.5, introducing several key advances: (1) seamless integration with TensorRT's post-training quantization flow enabling support for more neural networks including transformers, (2) a flexible noise injection methodology built on pre-characterized statistical models, making it straightforward to incorporate data from SPICE simulations or silicon measurements, (3) expanded device support including emerging non-volatile capacitive memories, and (4) up to 6.5x faster runtime than NeuroSim V1.4 through optimized behavioral simulation. The combination of these capabilities uniquely enables systematic design space exploration across both accuracy and hardware efficiency metrics. Through multiple case studies, we demonstrate optimization of critical design parameters while maintaining network accuracy. By bridging high-fidelity noise modeling with efficient simulation, NeuroSim V1.5 advances the design and validation of next-generation ACIM accelerators.

Abstract: Point cloud surface representation is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and vision. This paper presents a machine learning approach for approximating the signed distance function (SDF) of a point cloud using sparse ellipsoidal radial basis function networks, enabling a compact and accurate surface representation. Given the SDF values defined on the grid points constructed from the point cloud, our method approximates the SDF accurately with as few ellipsoidal radial basis functions (ERBFs) as possible, i.e., represent the SDF of a point cloud by sparse ERBFs. To balance sparsity and approximation precision, a dynamic multi-objective optimization strategy is introduced, which adaptively adds the regularization terms and jointly optimizes the weights, centers, shapes, and orientations of ERBFs. To improve computational efficiency, a nearest-neighbor-based data structure is employed, restricting function calculations to points near each Gaussian kernel center. The computations for each kernel are further parallelized on CUDA, which significantly improves the optimization speed. Additionally, a hierarchical octree-based refinement strategy is designed for training. Specifically, the initialization and optimization of network parameters are conducted using coarse grid points in the octree lattice structure. Subsequently, fine lattice points are progressively incorporated to accelerate model convergence and enhance training efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous sparse representation approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. The corresponding code is publicly available at https://github.com/lianbobo/SE-RBFNet.git.

Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant interest in the use of machine learning approaches in materials science research. Conventional deep learning approaches that rely on complex, nonlinear models have become increasingly important in computational materials science due to their high predictive accuracy. In contrast to these approaches, we have shown in a recent work that a remarkably simple learned heuristic rule -- based on the concept of topogivity -- can classify whether a material is topological using only its chemical composition. In this paper, we go beyond the topology classification scenario by also studying the use of machine learning to develop simple heuristic rules for classifying whether a material is a metal based on chemical composition. Moreover, we present a framework for incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias based on the structure of the periodic table. For both the topology classification and the metallicity classification tasks, we empirically characterize the performance of simple heuristic rules fit with and without chemistry-informed inductive bias across a wide range of training set sizes. We find evidence that incorporating chemistry-informed inductive bias can reduce the amount of training data required to reach a given level of test accuracy.

Abstract: Email spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems, essential for maintaining productivity, security, and user experience. Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while effective in static settings, face significant limitations in adapting to evolving spam tactics, addressing class imbalance, and managing data scarcity. These challenges necessitate innovative approaches that reduce dependency on extensive labeled datasets and frequent retraining. This study investigates the effectiveness of Zero-Shot Learning using FLAN-T5, combined with advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as BERT for email spam detection. By employing BERT to preprocess and extract critical information from email content, and FLAN-T5 to classify emails in a Zero-Shot framework, the proposed approach aims to address the limitations of traditional spam detection systems. The integration of FLAN-T5 and BERT enables robust spam detection without relying on extensive labeled datasets or frequent retraining, making it highly adaptable to unseen spam patterns and adversarial environments. This research highlights the potential of leveraging zero-shot learning and NLPs for scalable and efficient spam detection, providing insights into their capability to address the dynamic and challenging nature of spam detection tasks.

<title>JTCSE: Joint Tensor-Modulus Constraints and Cross-Attention for Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. Existing works usually aim at constraining the orientation distribution of the representations of positive and negative samples in the high-dimensional semantic space in contrastive learning, but the semantic representation tensor possesses both modulus and orientation features, and the existing works ignore the modulus feature of the representations and cause insufficient contrastive learning. % Therefore, we firstly propose a training objective that aims at modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between the positive samples in contrastive learning. Therefore, we first propose a training objective that is designed to impose modulus constraints on the semantic representation tensor, to strengthen the alignment between positive samples in contrastive learning. Then, the BERT-like model suffers from the phenomenon of sinking attention, leading to a lack of attention to CLS tokens that aggregate semantic information. In response, we propose a cross-attention structure among the twin-tower ensemble models to enhance the model's attention to CLS token and optimize the quality of CLS Pooling. Combining the above two motivations, we propose a new \textbf{J}oint \textbf{T}ensor representation modulus constraint and \textbf{C}ross-attention unsupervised contrastive learning \textbf{S}entence \textbf{E}mbedding representation framework JTCSE, which we evaluate in seven semantic text similarity computation tasks, and the experimental results show that JTCSE's twin-tower ensemble model and single-tower distillation model outperform the other baselines and become the current SOTA. In addition, we have conducted an extensive zero-shot downstream task evaluation, which shows that JTCSE outperforms other baselines overall on more than 130 tasks.

<title>SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.

<title>RM-R1: Reward Modeling as Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, especially through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. However, existing RMs either produce opaque scalar scores or directly generate the prediction of a preferred answer, making them struggle to integrate natural language critiques, thus lacking interpretability. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. In this work, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. The training consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. RM-R1 improves LLM rollouts by self-generating reasoning traces or chat-specific rubrics and evaluating candidate responses against them. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance of generative RMs across multiple comprehensive reward model benchmarks, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., Llama3.1-405B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 13.8%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at https://github.com/RM-R1-UIUC/RM-R1.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) research requires high-quality, diverse 3D scenes to effectively support skill acquisition, sim-to-real transfer, and generalization. Achieving these quality standards, however, necessitates the precise replication of real-world object diversity. Existing datasets demonstrate that this process heavily relies on artist-driven designs, which demand substantial human effort and present significant scalability challenges. To scalably produce realistic and interactive 3D scenes, we first present MetaScenes, a large-scale, simulatable 3D scene dataset constructed from real-world scans, which includes 15366 objects spanning 831 fine-grained categories. Then, we introduce Scan2Sim, a robust multi-modal alignment model, which enables the automated, high-quality replacement of assets, thereby eliminating the reliance on artist-driven designs for scaling 3D scenes. We further propose two benchmarks to evaluate MetaScenes: a detailed scene synthesis task focused on small item layouts for robotic manipulation and a domain transfer task in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) to validate cross-domain transfer. Results confirm MetaScene's potential to enhance EAI by supporting more generalizable agent learning and sim-to-real applications, introducing new possibilities for EAI research.

<title>ReeM: Ensemble Building Thermodynamics Model for Efficient HVAC Control via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superb-quality images, but its accessibility is limited by high costs, posing challenges for patients requiring longitudinal care. Low-field MRI provides affordable imaging with low-cost devices but is hindered by long scans and degraded image quality, including low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and tissue contrast. We propose a novel healthcare paradigm: using deep learning to extract personalized features from past standard high-field MRI scans and harnessing them to enable accelerated, enhanced-quality follow-up scans with low-cost systems. To overcome the SNR and contrast differences, we introduce ViT-Fuser, a feature-fusion vision transformer that learns features from past scans, e.g. those stored in standard DICOM CDs. We show that \textit{a single prior scan is sufficient}, and this scan can come from various MRI vendors, field strengths, and pulse sequences. Experiments with four datasets, including glioblastoma data, low-field ($50mT$), and ultra-low-field ($6.5mT$) data, demonstrate that ViT-Fuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing enhanced-quality images from accelerated low-field scans, with robustness to out-of-distribution data. Our freely available framework thus enables rapid, diagnostic-quality, low-cost imaging for wide healthcare applications.

Abstract: Computational chemistry tools are widely used to study the behaviour of chemical phenomena. Yet, the complexity of these tools can make them inaccessible to non-specialists and challenging even for experts. In this work, we introduce El Agente Q, an LLM-based multi-agent system that dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language user prompts. The system is built on a novel cognitive architecture featuring a hierarchical memory framework that enables flexible task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, post-analysis, and autonomous file handling and submission. El Agente Q is benchmarked on six university-level course exercises and two case studies, demonstrating robust problem-solving performance (averaging >87% task success) and adaptive error handling through in situ debugging. It also supports longer-term, multi-step task execution for more complex workflows, while maintaining transparency through detailed action trace logs. Together, these capabilities lay the foundation for increasingly autonomous and accessible quantum chemistry.

<title>Corr2Distrib: Making Ambiguous Correspondences an Ally to Predict Reliable 6D Pose Distributions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02501</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We introduce Corr2Distrib, the first correspondence-based method which estimates a 6D camera pose distribution from an RGB image, explaining the observations. Indeed, symmetries and occlusions introduce visual ambiguities, leading to multiple valid poses. While a few recent methods tackle this problem, they do not rely on local correspondences which, according to the BOP Challenge, are currently the most effective way to estimate a single 6DoF pose solution. Using correspondences to estimate a pose distribution is not straightforward, since ambiguous correspondences induced by visual ambiguities drastically decrease the performance of PnP. With Corr2Distrib, we turn these ambiguities into an advantage to recover all valid poses. Corr2Distrib first learns a symmetry-aware representation for each 3D point on the object's surface, characterized by a descriptor and a local frame. This representation enables the generation of 3DoF rotation hypotheses from single 2D-3D correspondences. Next, we refine these hypotheses into a 6DoF pose distribution using PnP and pose scoring. Our experimental evaluations on complex non-synthetic scenes show that Corr2Distrib outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for both pose distribution estimation and single pose estimation from an RGB image, demonstrating the potential of correspondences-based approaches.

<title>Resolving Memorization in Empirical Diffusion Model for Manifold Data in High-Dimensional Spaces</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models is a popular computational tool to generate new data samples. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data distribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples from the data distribution. However, when the empirical data distribution consists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will necessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to as the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine learning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the memorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end of the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model requires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not require any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model sample distribution is an $O\left(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}}\right)$ Wasserstein-1 approximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension $d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance between population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the inertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper bound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no training involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion model samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density estimator on the manifold. This reveals an interesting connection between diffusion model and manifold learning.

Abstract: Advanced neural interfaces are transforming applications ranging from neuroscience research to diagnostic tools (for mental state recognition, tremor and seizure detection) as well as prosthetic devices (for motor and communication recovery). By integrating complex functions into miniaturized neural devices, these systems unlock significant opportunities for personalized assistive technologies and adaptive therapeutic interventions. Leveraging high-density neural recordings, on-site signal processing, and machine learning (ML), these interfaces extract critical features, identify disease neuro-markers, and enable accurate, low-latency neural decoding. This integration facilitates real-time interpretation of neural signals, adaptive modulation of brain activity, and efficient control of assistive devices. Moreover, the synergy between neural interfaces and ML has paved the way for self-sufficient, ubiquitous platforms capable of operating in diverse environments with minimal hardware costs and external dependencies. In this work, we review recent advancements in AI-driven decoding algorithms and energy-efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms for next-generation miniaturized neural devices. These innovations highlight the potential for developing intelligent neural interfaces, addressing critical challenges in scalability, reliability, interpretability, and user adaptability.

Abstract: Partial hand amputations significantly affect the physical and psychosocial well-being of individuals, yet intuitive control of externally powered prostheses remains an open challenge. To address this gap, we developed a force-controlled prosthetic finger activated by electromyography (EMG) signals. The prototype, constructed around a wrist brace, functions as a supernumerary finger placed near the index, allowing for early-stage evaluation on unimpaired subjects. A neural network-based model was then implemented to estimate fingertip forces from EMG inputs, allowing for online adjustment of the prosthetic finger grip strength. The force estimation model was validated through experiments with ten participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting forces. Additionally, online trials with four users wearing the prosthesis exhibited precise control over the device. Our findings highlight the potential of using EMG-based force estimation to enhance the functionality of prosthetic fingers.

Abstract: Reasoning tasks are crucial in many domains, especially in science and engineering. Although large language models (LLMs) have made progress in reasoning tasks using techniques such as chain-of-thought and least-to-most prompting, these approaches still do not effectively scale to complex problems in either their performance or execution time. Moreover, they often require additional supervision for each new task, such as in-context examples. In this work, we introduce Recursive Decomposition with Dependencies (RDD), a scalable divide-and-conquer method for solving reasoning problems that requires less supervision than prior approaches. Our method can be directly applied to a new problem class even in the absence of any task-specific guidance. Furthermore, RDD supports sub-task dependencies, allowing for ordered execution of sub-tasks, as well as an error recovery mechanism that can correct mistakes made in previous steps. We evaluate our approach on two benchmarks with six difficulty levels each and in two in-context settings: one with task-specific examples and one without. Our results demonstrate that RDD outperforms other methods in a compute-matched setting as task complexity increases, while also being more computationally efficient.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable and interpretable framework for lane-wise highway traffic anomaly detection, leveraging multi-modal time series data extracted from surveillance cameras. Unlike traditional sensor-dependent methods, our approach uses AI-powered vision models to extract lane-specific features, including vehicle count, occupancy, and truck percentage, without relying on costly hardware or complex road modeling. We introduce a novel dataset containing 73,139 lane-wise samples, annotated with four classes of expert-validated anomalies: three traffic-related anomalies (lane blockage and recovery, foreign object intrusion, and sustained congestion) and one sensor-related anomaly (camera angle shift). Our multi-branch detection system integrates deep learning, rule-based logic, and machine learning to improve robustness and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-world intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: This paper focuses on applying entropic mirror descent to solve linear systems, where the main challenge for the convergence analysis stems from the unboundedness of the domain. To overcome this without imposing restrictive assumptions, we introduce a variant of Polyak-type stepsizes. Along the way, we strengthen the bound for $\ell_1$-norm implicit bias, obtain sublinear and linear convergence results, and generalize the convergence result to arbitrary convex $L$-smooth functions. We also propose an alternative method that avoids exponentiation, resembling the original Hadamard descent, but with provable convergence.

Abstract: Gaze may enhance the robustness of lie detectors but remains under-studied. This study evaluated the efficacy of AI models (using fixations, saccades, blinks, and pupil size) for detecting deception in Concealed Information Tests across two datasets. The first, collected with Eyelink 1000, contains gaze data from a computerized experiment where 87 participants revealed, concealed, or faked the value of a previously selected card. The second, collected with Pupil Neon, involved 36 participants performing a similar task but facing an experimenter. XGBoost achieved accuracies up to 74% in a binary classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing) and 49% in a more challenging three-classification task (Revealing vs. Concealing vs. Faking). Feature analysis identified saccade number, duration, amplitude, and maximum pupil size as the most important for deception prediction. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using gaze and AI to enhance lie detectors and encourage future research that may improve on this.

Abstract: Grasp pose detection in cluttered, real-world environments remains a significant challenge due to noisy and incomplete sensory data combined with complex object geometries. This paper introduces Grasp the Graph 2.0 (GtG 2.0) method, a lightweight yet highly effective hypothesis-and-test robotics grasping framework which leverages an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks for efficient geometric reasoning from point cloud data. Building on the success of GtG 1.0, which demonstrated the potential of Graph Neural Networks for grasp detection but was limited by assumptions of complete, noise-free point clouds and 4-Dof grasping, GtG 2.0 employs a conventional Grasp Pose Generator to efficiently produce 7-Dof grasp candidates. Candidates are assessed with an ensemble Graph Neural Network model which includes points within the gripper jaws (inside points) and surrounding contextual points (outside points). This improved representation boosts grasp detection performance over previous methods using the same generator. GtG 2.0 shows up to a 35% improvement in Average Precision on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark compared to hypothesis-and-test and Graph Neural Network-based methods, ranking it among the top three frameworks. Experiments with a 3-Dof Delta Parallel robot and Kinect-v1 camera show a success rate of 91% and a clutter completion rate of 100%, demonstrating its flexibility and reliability.

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, their robust adherence to human-assigned objectives becomes crucial for safe operation. When these agents operate independently for extended periods without human oversight, even initially well-specified goals may gradually shift. Detecting and measuring goal drift - an agent's tendency to deviate from its original objective over time - presents significant challenges, as goals can shift gradually, causing only subtle behavioral changes. This paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing goal drift in LM agents. In our experiments, agents are first explicitly given a goal through their system prompt, then exposed to competing objectives through environmental pressures. We demonstrate that while the best-performing agent (a scaffolded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet) maintains nearly perfect goal adherence for more than 100,000 tokens in our most difficult evaluation setting, all evaluated models exhibit some degree of goal drift. We also find that goal drift correlates with models' increasing susceptibility to pattern-matching behaviors as the context length grows.

This is likely due to their insufficient exposure to real-world clinical data during training, as such data is typically not included due to privacy concerns. To address this, we propose enhancing the clinical reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging real-world clinical data. We constructed reasoning-intensive questions from a nationwide sepsis registry and fine-tuned Phi-4 on these questions using reinforcement learning, resulting in C-Reason. C-Reason exhibited strong clinical reasoning capabilities on the in-domain test set, as evidenced by both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations. Furthermore, its enhanced reasoning capabilities generalized to a sepsis dataset involving different tasks and patient cohorts, an open-ended consultations on antibiotics use task, and other diseases. Future research should focus on training LLMs with large-scale, multi-disease clinical datasets to develop more powerful, general-purpose clinical reasoning models.

Abstract: Formal mathematical reasoning remains a critical challenge for artificial intelligence, hindered by limitations of existing benchmarks in scope and scale. To address this, we present FormalMATH, a large-scale Lean4 benchmark comprising 5,560 formally verified problems spanning from high-school Olympiad challenges to undergraduate-level theorems across diverse domains (e.g., algebra, applied mathematics, calculus, number theory, and discrete mathematics). To mitigate the inefficiency of manual formalization, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop autoformalization pipeline that integrates: (1) specialized large language models (LLMs) for statement autoformalization, (2) multi-LLM semantic verification, and (3) negation-based disproof filtering strategies using off-the-shelf LLM-based provers. This approach reduces expert annotation costs by retaining 72.09% of statements before manual verification while ensuring fidelity to the original natural-language problems. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based theorem provers reveals significant limitations: even the strongest models achieve only 16.46% success rate under practical sampling budgets, exhibiting pronounced domain bias (e.g., excelling in algebra but failing in calculus) and over-reliance on simplified automation tactics. Notably, we identify a counterintuitive inverse relationship between natural-language solution guidance and proof success in chain-of-thought reasoning scenarios, suggesting that human-written informal reasoning introduces noise rather than clarity in the formal reasoning settings. We believe that FormalMATH provides a robust benchmark for benchmarking formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

<title>Adaptive Bidding Policies for First-Price Auctions with Budget Constraints under Non-stationarity</title>

Abstract: We study how a budget-constrained bidder should learn to adaptively bid in repeated first-price auctions to maximize her cumulative payoff. This problem arose due to an industry-wide shift from second-price auctions to first-price auctions in display advertising recently, which renders truthful bidding (i.e., always bidding one's private value) no longer optimal. We propose a simple dual-gradient-descent-based bidding policy that maintains a dual variable for budget constraint as the bidder consumes her budget. In analysis, we consider two settings regarding the bidder's knowledge of her private values in the future: (i) an uninformative setting where all the distributional knowledge (can be non-stationary) is entirely unknown to the bidder, and (ii) an informative setting where a prediction of the budget allocation in advance. We characterize the performance loss (or regret) relative to an optimal policy with complete information on the stochasticity. For uninformative setting, We show that the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus a variation term that reflects the non-stationarity of the value distributions, and this is of optimal order. We then show that we can get rid of the variation term with the help of the prediction; specifically, the regret is \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) plus the prediction error term in the informative setting.

Abstract: Agents are predominantly evaluated and optimized via task success metrics, which are coarse, rely on manual design from experts, and fail to reward intermediate emergent behaviors. We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., "If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again", or "This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: "coverage" and "redundancy". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%. Second, we show that AutoLibra can iteratively select high-quality fine-tuning data for web navigation agents. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.

Abstract: Teleoperating humanoid robots in a whole-body manner marks a fundamental step toward developing general-purpose robotic intelligence, with human motion providing an ideal interface for controlling all degrees of freedom. Yet, most current humanoid teleoperation systems fall short of enabling coordinated whole-body behavior, typically limiting themselves to isolated locomotion or manipulation tasks. We present the Teleoperated Whole-Body Imitation System (TWIST), a system for humanoid teleoperation through whole-body motion imitation. We first generate reference motion clips by retargeting human motion capture data to the humanoid robot. We then develop a robust, adaptive, and responsive whole-body controller using a combination of reinforcement learning and behavior cloning (RL+BC). Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how incorporating privileged future motion frames and real-world motion capture (MoCap) data improves tracking accuracy. TWIST enables real-world humanoid robots to achieve unprecedented, versatile, and coordinated whole-body motor skills--spanning whole-body manipulation, legged manipulation, locomotion, and expressive movement--using a single unified neural network controller.

Abstract: There is a recent growing interest in applying Deep Learning techniques to tabular data, in order to replicate the success of other Artificial Intelligence areas in this structured domain. Specifically interesting is the case in which tabular data have a time dependence, such as, for instance financial transactions. However, the heterogeneity of the tabular values, in which categorical elements are mixed with numerical items, makes this adaptation difficult. In this paper we propose a Transformer architecture to represent heterogeneous time-dependent tabular data, in which numerical features are represented using a set of frequency functions and the whole network is uniformly trained with a unique loss function.

Abstract: The intersection of Foundation Model (FM) and Federated Learning (FL) presents a unique opportunity to unlock new possibilities for real-world applications. On the one hand, FL, as a collaborative learning paradigm, help address challenges in FM development by expanding data availability, enabling computation sharing, facilitating the collaborative development of FMs, tackling continuous data update, avoiding FM monopoly, response delay and FM service down. On the other hand, FM, equipped with pre-trained knowledge and exceptional performance, can serve as a robust starting point for FL. It can also generate synthetic data to enrich data diversity and enhance overall performance of FL. Meanwhile, FM unlocks new sharing paradigm and multi-task and multi-modality capabilities for FL. By examining the interplay between FL and FM, this paper presents the motivations, challenges, and future directions of empowering FL with FM and empowering FM with FL. We hope that this work provides a good foundation to inspire future research efforts to drive advancements in both fields.

Abstract: In recent years, Sentiment Analysis (SA) and Emotion Recognition (ER) have been increasingly popular in the Bangla language, which is the seventh most spoken language throughout the entire world. However, the language is structurally complicated, which makes this field arduous to extract emotions in an accurate manner. Several distinct approaches such as the extraction of positive and negative sentiments as well as multiclass emotions, have been implemented in this field of study. Nevertheless, the extraction of multiple sentiments is an almost untouched area in this language. Which involves identifying several feelings based on a single piece of text. Therefore, this study demonstrates a thorough method for constructing an annotated corpus based on scrapped data from Facebook to bridge the gaps in this subject area to overcome the challenges. To make this annotation more fruitful, the context-based approach has been used. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a well-known methodology of transformers, have been shown the best results of all methods implemented. Finally, a web application has been developed to demonstrate the performance of the pre-trained top-performer model (BERT) for multi-label ER in Bangla.

Abstract: Sharpness, a geometric measure in the parameter space that reflects the flatness of the loss landscape, has long been studied for its potential connections to neural network behavior. While sharpness is often associated with generalization, recent work highlights inconsistencies in this relationship, leaving its true significance unclear. In this paper, we investigate how sharpness influences the local geometric features of neural representations in feature space, offering a new perspective on its role. We introduce this problem and study three measures for compression: the Local Volumetric Ratio (LVR), based on volume compression, the Maximum Local Sensitivity (MLS), based on sensitivity to input changes, and the Local Dimensionality, based on how uniform the sensitivity is on different directions. We show that LVR and MLS correlate with the flatness of the loss around the local minima; and that this correlation is predicted by a relatively simple mathematical relationship: a flatter loss corresponds to a lower upper bound on the compression metrics of neural representations. Our work builds upon the linear stability insight by Ma and Ying, deriving inequalities between various compression metrics and quantities involving sharpness. Our inequalities readily extend to reparametrization-invariant sharpness as well. Through empirical experiments on various feedforward, convolutional, and transformer architectures, we find that our inequalities predict a consistently positive correlation between local representation compression and sharpness.

Abstract: The capability of generalization is a cornerstone for the success of modern learning systems. For non-Euclidean data, e.g., graphs, that particularly involves topological structures, one important aspect neglected by prior studies is how machine learning models generalize under topological shifts. This paper proposes AdvDIFFormer, a physics-inspired graph Transformer model designed to address this challenge. The model is derived from advective diffusion equations which describe a class of continuous message passing process with observed and latent topological structures. We show that AdvDIFFormer has provable capability for controlling generalization error with topological shifts, which in contrast cannot be guaranteed by graph diffusion models. Empirically, the model demonstrates superiority in various predictive tasks across information networks, molecular screening and protein interactions.

Abstract: To defend against privacy leakage of user data, differential privacy is widely used in federated learning, but it is not free. The addition of noise randomly disrupts the semantic integrity of the model and this disturbance accumulates with increased communication rounds. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning framework with rigorous privacy guarantees, named FedCEO, designed to strike a trade-off between model utility and user privacy by letting clients ''Collaborate with Each Other''. Specifically, we perform efficient tensor low-rank proximal optimization on stacked local model parameters at the server, demonstrating its capability to flexibly truncate high-frequency components in spectral space. This capability implies that our FedCEO can effectively recover the disrupted semantic information by smoothing the global semantic space for different privacy settings and continuous training processes. Moreover, we improve the SOTA utility-privacy trade-off bound by order of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We illustrate our theoretical results with experiments on representative datasets and observe significant performance improvements and strict privacy guarantees under different privacy settings. The code is available at https://github.com/6lyc/FedCEO_Collaborate-with-Each-Other.

Abstract: Existing models encounter bottlenecks in balancing performance and computational efficiency when modeling long sequences. Although the state space model (SSM) has achieved remarkable success in handling long sequence tasks, it still faces the problem of large number of parameters. In order to further improve the efficiency of SSM, we propose a new state space layer based on multiple-input multiple-output SSM, called efficient SSM (eSSM). Our eSSM is built on the convolutional representation of multi-input and multi-input (MIMO) SSM. We propose a variety of effective strategies to improve the computational efficiency. The diagonalization of the system matrix first decouples the original system. Then a fast tensor convolution is proposed based on the fast Fourier transform. In addition, the block diagonalization of the SSM further reduces the model parameters and improves the model flexibility. Extensive experimental results show that the performance of the proposed model on multiple databases matches the performance of state-of-the-art models, such as S4, and is significantly better than Transformers and LSTM. In the model efficiency benchmark, the parameters of eSSM are only 12.89\% of LSTM and 13.24\% of Mamba. The training speed of eSSM is 3.94 times faster than LSTM and 1.35 times faster than Mamba.

<title>REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.5\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning dynamic functional connectivity for distinguishing phenotypes from human brain networks. However, obtaining extensive labeled clinical data for training is often resource-intensive, making practical application difficult. Leveraging unlabeled data thus becomes crucial for representation learning in a label-scarce setting. Although generative self-supervised learning techniques, especially masked autoencoders, have shown promising results in representation learning in various domains, their application to dynamic graphs for dynamic functional connectivity remains underexplored, facing challenges in capturing high-level semantic representations. Here, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Joint Embedding Masked Autoencoder (ST-JEMA), drawing inspiration from the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) in computer vision. ST-JEMA employs a JEPA-inspired strategy for reconstructing dynamic graphs, which enables the learning of higher-level semantic representations considering temporal perspectives, addressing the challenges in fMRI data representation learning. Utilizing the large-scale UK Biobank dataset for self-supervised learning, ST-JEMA shows exceptional representation learning performance on dynamic functional connectivity demonstrating superiority over previous methods in predicting phenotypes and psychiatric diagnoses across eight benchmark fMRI datasets even with limited samples and effectiveness of temporal reconstruction on missing data scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of our approach as a robust representation learning method for leveraging label-scarce fMRI data.

Abstract: Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graphs (HGs) effectively model complex relationships in the real world through multi-type nodes and edges. In recent years, inspired by self-supervised learning (SSL), contrastive learning (CL)-based Heterogeneous Graphs Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown great potential in utilizing data augmentation and contrastive discriminators for downstream tasks. However, data augmentation remains limited due to the graph data's integrity. Furthermore, the contrastive discriminators suffer from sampling bias and lack local heterogeneous information. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Generative-Contrastive Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GC-HGNN). Specifically, we propose a heterogeneous graph generative learning method that enhances CL-based paradigm. This paradigm includes: 1) A contrastive view augmentation strategy using a masked autoencoder. 2) Position-aware and semantics-aware positive sample sampling strategy for generating hard negative samples. 3) A hierarchical contrastive learning strategy aimed at capturing local and global information. Furthermore, the hierarchical contrastive learning and sampling strategies aim to constitute an enhanced contrastive discriminator under the generative-contrastive perspective. Finally, we compare our model with seventeen baselines on eight real-world datasets. Our model outperforms the latest baselines on node classification and link prediction tasks.

Abstract: A core data-centric learning challenge is the identification of training samples that are detrimental to model performance. Influence functions serve as a prominent tool for this task and offer a robust framework for assessing training data influence on model predictions. Despite their widespread use, their high computational cost associated with calculating the inverse of the Hessian matrix pose constraints, particularly when analyzing large-sized deep models. In this paper, we establish a bridge between identifying detrimental training samples via influence functions and outlier gradient detection. This transformation not only presents a straightforward and Hessian-free formulation but also provides insights into the role of the gradient in sample impact. Through systematic empirical evaluations, we first validate the hypothesis of our proposed outlier gradient analysis approach on synthetic datasets. We then demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting mislabeled samples in vision models and selecting data samples for improving performance of natural language processing transformer models. We also extend its use to influential sample identification for fine-tuning Large Language Models.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a series of techniques that generate high-quality artificial data by manipulating existing data samples. By leveraging data augmentation techniques, AI models can achieve significantly improved applicability in tasks involving scarce or imbalanced datasets, thereby substantially enhancing AI models' generalization capabilities. Existing literature surveys only focus on a certain type of specific modality data, and categorize these methods from modality-specific and operation-centric perspectives, which lacks a consistent summary of data augmentation methods across multiple modalities and limits the comprehension of how existing data samples serve the data augmentation process. To bridge this gap, we propose a more enlightening taxonomy that encompasses data augmentation techniques for different common data modalities. Specifically, from a data-centric perspective, this survey proposes a modality-independent taxonomy by investigating how to take advantage of the intrinsic relationship between data samples, including single-wise, pair-wise, and population-wise sample data augmentation methods. Additionally, we categorize data augmentation methods across five data modalities through a unified inductive approach.

Abstract: In machine learning practice it is often useful to identify relevant input features, so as to obtain compact dataset for more efficient numerical handling. On the other hand, by isolating key input elements, ranked according their respective degree of relevance, can help to elaborate on the process of decision making. Here, we propose a novel method to estimate the relative importance of the input components for a Deep Neural Network. This is achieved by leveraging on a spectral re-parametrization of the optimization process. Eigenvalues associated to input nodes provide in fact a robust proxy to gauge the relevance of the supplied entry features. Notably, the spectral features ranking is performed automatically, as a byproduct of the network training, with no additional processing to be carried out. The technique is successfully challenged against both synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Tensor factorizations have been widely used for the task of uncovering patterns in various domains. Often, the input is time-evolving, shifting the goal to tracking the evolution of the underlying patterns instead. To adapt to this more complex setting, existing methods incorporate temporal regularization but they either have overly constrained structural requirements or lack uniqueness which is crucial for interpretation. In this paper, in order to capture the underlying evolving patterns, we introduce t(emporal)PARAFAC2, which utilizes temporal smoothness regularization on the evolving factors. Previously, Alternating Optimization (AO) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithmic approach has been introduced to fit the PARAFAC2 model to fully observed data. In this paper, we extend this algorithmic framework to the case of partially observed data and use it to fit the tPARAFAC2 model to complete and incomplete datasets with the goal of revealing evolving patterns. Our numerical experiments on simulated datasets demonstrate that tPARAFAC2 can extract the underlying evolving patterns more accurately compared to the state-of-the-art in the presence of high amounts of noise and missing data. Using two real datasets, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic approach in terms of handling missing data and tPARAFAC2 model in terms of revealing evolving patterns. The paper provides an extensive comparison of different approaches for handling missing data within the proposed framework, and discusses both the advantages and limitations of tPARAFAC2 model.

Abstract: We formalise the essential data of objective functions as equality constraints on composites of learners. We call these constraints "tasks", and we investigate the idealised view that such tasks determine model behaviours. We develop a flowchart-like graphical mathematics for tasks that allows us to; (1) offer a unified perspective of approaches in machine learning across domains; (2) design and optimise desired behaviours model-agnostically; and (3) import insights from theoretical computer science into practical machine learning. As a proof-of-concept of the potential practical impact of our theoretical framework, we exhibit and implement a novel "manipulator" task that minimally edits input data to have a desired attribute. Our model-agnostic approach achieves this end-to-end, and without the need for custom architectures, adversarial training, random sampling, or interventions on the data, hence enabling capable, small-scale, and training-stable models.

Abstract: Distributed deep learning in resource-constrained environments faces scalability and generalization challenges due to large effective batch sizes and non-identically distributed client data. We introduce a server-driven sampling strategy that maintains a fixed global batch size by dynamically adjusting client-side batch sizes. This decouples the effective batch size from the number of participating devices and ensures that global batches better reflect the overall data distribution. Using standard concentration bounds, we establish tighter deviation guarantees compared to existing approaches. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset confirm that the proposed method improves model accuracy, training efficiency, and convergence stability, offering a scalable solution for learning at the network edge.

Abstract: This work presents and evaluates the ranking algorithm that has been used by Federation Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) since 2020. The prominent feature of the FIVB ranking is the use of the probabilistic model, which explicitly calculates the probabilities of the future matches results using the estimated teams' strengths. Such explicit modeling is new in the context of official sport rankings, especially for multi-level outcomes, and we study the optimality of its parameters using both analytical and numerical methods. We conclude that from the modeling perspective, the current thresholds fit well the data but adding the home-field advantage (HFA) would be beneficial. Regarding the algorithm itself, we explain the rationale behind the approximations currently used and show a simple method to find new parameters (numerical score) which improve the performance. We also show that the weighting of the match results is counterproductive.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis says that natural high-dimensional data lie on or around a low-dimensional manifold. The recent success of statistical and learning-based methods in very high dimensions empirically supports this hypothesis, suggesting that typical worst-case analysis does not provide practical guarantees. A natural step for analysis is thus to assume the manifold hypothesis and derive bounds that are independent of any ambient dimensions that the data may be embedded in. Theoretical implications in this direction have recently been explored in terms of generalization of ReLU networks and convergence of Langevin methods. In this work, we consider optimal uniform approximations with functions of finite statistical complexity. While upper bounds on uniform approximation exist in the literature using ReLU neural networks, we consider the opposite: lower bounds to quantify the fundamental difficulty of approximation on manifolds. In particular, we demonstrate that the statistical complexity required to approximate a class of bounded Sobolev functions on a compact manifold is bounded from below, and moreover that this bound is dependent only on the intrinsic properties of the manifold, such as curvature, volume, and injectivity radius.

Abstract: Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) have attracted considerable attention for inferring the system states and physical parameters of differential equations according to noisy observations. However, in practice, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) used to estimate the internal parameters of the solver for BPINN often encounters these troubles including poor performance and awful convergence for a given step size used to adjust the momentum of those parameters. To address the convergence of HMC for the BPINN method and extend its application scope to multi-scale partial differential equations (PDE), we develop a robust multi-scale BPINN (dubbed MBPINN) method by integrating multi-scale deep neural networks (MscaleDNN) and the BPINN framework. In this newly proposed MBPINN method, we reframe HMC with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to ensure the most ``likely'' estimation is always provided, and we configure its solver as a Fourier feature mapping-induced MscaleDNN. This novel method offers several key advantages: (1) it is more robust than HMC, (2) it incurs less computational cost than HMC, and (3) it is more flexible for complex problems. We demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed method through some general Poisson and multi-scale elliptic problems in one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Our findings indicate that the proposed method can avoid HMC failures and provide valid results. Additionally, our method is capable of handling complex elliptic PDE and producing comparable results for general elliptic PDE under the case of lower signal-to-noise rate. These findings suggest that our proposed approach has great potential for physics-informed machine learning for parameter estimation and solution recovery in the case of ill-posed problems.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling diverse modalities and tasks, outperforming conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that are highly task-specific and modality-reliant. In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns policies from a fixed dataset, but often requires large amounts of data. The challenge arises when labeled datasets are expensive, especially when rewards have to be provided by human labelers for large datasets. In contrast, unlabelled data tends to be less expensive. This situation highlights the importance of finding effective ways to use unlabelled data in offline RL, especially when labelled data is limited or expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present the algorithm to utilize the unlabeled data in the offline RL method with kernel function approximation and give the theoretical guarantee. We present various eigenvalue decay conditions of $\mathcal{H}_k$ which determine the complexity of the algorithm. In summary, our work provides a promising approach for exploiting the advantages offered by unlabeled data in offline RL, whilst maintaining theoretical assurances.

Abstract: Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized clients to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping all the training data local. While considerable research has focused on federated image generation, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders have received less attention. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-IID (independently and identically distributed) data environments featuring multiple groups of images of different types. Non-IID data distributions can lead to difficulties in maintaining a consistent latent space and can also result in local generators with disparate texture features being blended during aggregation. We thereby introduce FissionVAE that decouples the latent space and constructs decoder branches tailored to individual client groups. This method allows for customized learning that aligns with the unique data distributions of each group. Additionally, we incorporate hierarchical VAEs and demonstrate the use of heterogeneous decoder architectures within FissionVAE. We also explore strategies for setting the latent prior distributions to enhance the decoupling process. To evaluate our approach, we assemble two composite datasets: the first combines MNIST and FashionMNIST; the second comprises RGB datasets of cartoon and human faces, wild animals, marine vessels, and remote sensing images. Our experiments demonstrate that FissionVAE greatly improves generation quality on these datasets compared to baseline federated VAE models.

Abstract: Current multimodal alignment strategies primarily use single or unified modality encoders, while optimizing the alignment on the original token space. Such a framework is easy to implement and incorporate with the pretrained knowledge, but might result in information bias. To deal with such issues, the joint encoding predictive architecture (JEPA) learns the alignment loss on the latent space, with a predictor to convert the input encoding to the output latent space. However, the application of JEPA in multimodal scenarios is limited so far. In this paper, we introduce M3-Jepa, a scalable multimodal alignment framework, with the predictor implemented by a multi-directional mixture of experts (MoE). We demonstrate the framework can maximize the mutual information with information theory derivations, by alternating the optimization between different uni-directional tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-Jepa can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in training and inference. Our study indicates that M3-Jepa might provide a new paradigm to self-supervised learning and open-world modeling.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is critical for science and society. Yet, existing methods have not managed to simultaneously have the properties of high accuracy, low uncertainty, and high computational efficiency. On one hand, to quantify the uncertainty in weather predictions, the strategy of ensemble forecast (i.e., generating a set of diverse predictions) is often employed. However, traditional ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) is computationally intensive. On the other hand, most existing machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) approaches are efficient and accurate. Nevertheless, they are deterministic and cannot capture the uncertainty of weather forecasting. In this work, we propose CoDiCast, a conditional diffusion model to generate accurate global weather prediction, while achieving uncertainty quantification with ensemble forecasts and modest computational cost. The key idea is to simulate a conditional version of the reverse denoising process in diffusion models, which starts from pure Gaussian noise to generate realistic weather scenarios for a future time point. Each denoising step is conditioned on observations from the recent past. Ensemble forecasts are achieved by repeatedly sampling from stochastic Gaussian noise to represent uncertainty quantification. CoDiCast is trained on a decade of ERA5 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several existing data-driven methods in accuracy. Our conditional diffusion model, CoDiCast, can generate 6-day global weather forecasts, at 6-hour steps and $5.625^\circ$ latitude-longitude resolution, for over 5 variables, in about 12 minutes on a commodity A100 GPU machine with 80GB memory. The open-souced code is provided at https://github.com/JimengShi/CoDiCast.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is increasingly recognized as a key component for ensuring the resilience of future communication systems. While deep learning has shown state-of-the-art AD performance, its application in critical systems is hindered by concerns regarding training data efficiency, domain adaptation and interpretability. This work considers AD in network flows using incomplete measurements, leveraging a robust tensor decomposition approach and deep unrolling techniques to address these challenges. We first propose a novel block-successive convex approximation algorithm based on a regularized model-fitting objective where the normal flows are modeled as low-rank tensors and anomalies as sparse. An augmentation of the objective is introduced to decrease the computational cost. We apply deep unrolling to derive a novel deep network architecture based on our proposed algorithm, treating the regularization parameters as learnable weights. Inspired by Bayesian approaches, we extend the model architecture to perform online adaptation to per-flow and per-time-step statistics, improving AD performance while maintaining a low parameter count and preserving the problem's permutation equivariances. To optimize the deep network weights for detection performance, we employ a homotopy optimization approach based on an efficient approximation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our proposed deep network architecture exhibits a high training data efficiency, outperforms reference methods, and adapts seamlessly to varying network topologies.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.

Abstract: We present Hybrid-Autoregressive INference TrANsducers (HAINAN), a novel architecture for speech recognition that extends the Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) model. Trained with randomly masked predictor network outputs, HAINAN supports both autoregressive inference with all network components and non-autoregressive inference without the predictor. Additionally, we propose a novel semi-autoregressive inference paradigm that first generates an initial hypothesis using non-autoregressive inference, followed by refinement steps where each token prediction is regenerated using parallelized autoregression on the initial hypothesis. Experiments on multiple datasets across different languages demonstrate that HAINAN achieves efficiency parity with CTC in non-autoregressive mode and with TDT in autoregressive mode. In terms of accuracy, autoregressive HAINAN outperforms TDT and RNN-T, while non-autoregressive HAINAN significantly outperforms CTC. Semi-autoregressive inference further enhances the model's accuracy with minimal computational overhead, and even outperforms TDT results in some cases. These results highlight HAINAN's flexibility in balancing accuracy and speed, positioning it as a strong candidate for real-world speech recognition applications.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into every aspect of our work and daily lives, there are growing concerns about user privacy, which push the trend toward local deployment of these models. There are a number of lightweight LLMs (e.g., Gemini Nano, LLAMA2 7B) that can run locally on smartphones, providing users with greater control over their personal data. As a rapidly emerging application, we are concerned about their performance on commercial-off-the-shelf mobile devices. To fully understand the current landscape of LLM deployment on mobile platforms, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on mobile devices. We evaluate both metrics that affect user experience, including token throughput, latency, and battery consumption, as well as factors critical to developers, such as resource utilization, DVFS strategies, and inference engines. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of how these hardware capabilities and system dynamics affect on-device LLM performance, which may help developers identify and address bottlenecks for mobile LLM applications. We also provide comprehensive comparisons across the mobile system-on-chips (SoCs) from major vendors, highlighting their performance differences in handling LLM workloads. We hope that this study can provide insights for both the development of on-device LLMs and the design for future mobile system architecture.

Abstract: In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/

Abstract: Self-supervision is often used for pre-training to foster performance on a downstream task by constructing meaningful representations of samples. Self-supervised learning (SSL) generally involves generating different views of the same sample and thus requires data augmentations that are challenging to construct for tabular data. This constitutes one of the main challenges of self-supervision for structured data. In the present work, we propose a novel augmentation-free SSL method for tabular data. Our approach, T-JEPA, relies on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and is akin to mask reconstruction in the latent space. It involves predicting the latent representation of one subset of features from the latent representation of a different subset within the same sample, thereby learning rich representations without augmentations. We use our method as a pre-training technique and train several deep classifiers on the obtained representation. Our experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both classification and regression tasks, outperforming models trained directly on samples in their original data space. Moreover, T-JEPA enables some methods to consistently outperform or match the performance of traditional methods likes Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. To understand why, we extensively characterize the obtained representations and show that T-JEPA effectively identifies relevant features for downstream tasks without access to the labels. Additionally, we introduce regularization tokens, a novel regularization method critical for training of JEPA-based models on structured data.

Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.

Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has gained significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction--an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers, optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems, and learning safe decision logic for aircraft systems.

Abstract: Current generative models for drug discovery primarily use molecular docking as an oracle to guide the generation of active compounds. However, such models are often not useful in practice because even compounds with high docking scores do not consistently show real-world experimental activity. More accurate methods for activity prediction exist, such as molecular dynamics based binding free energy calculations, but they are too computationally expensive to use in a generative model. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent space Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates a set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. We train a surrogate model for each oracle and use these surrogates to guide generation of compounds with high predicted activity. Unlike previous approaches that separately learn the surrogate model and generative model, MF-LAL combines the generative and multi-fidelity surrogate models into a single framework, allowing for more accurate activity prediction and higher quality samples. We train MF-LAL with a novel active learning algorithm to further reduce computational cost. Our experiments on two disease-relevant proteins show that MF-LAL produces compounds with significantly better binding free energy scores than other single and multi-fidelity approaches (~50% improvement in mean binding free energy score).

Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.

Abstract: The NTK is a widely used tool in the theoretical analysis of deep learning, allowing us to look at supervised deep neural networks through the lenses of kernel regression. Recently, several works have investigated kernel models for self-supervised learning, hypothesizing that these also shed light on the behavior of wide neural networks by virtue of the NTK. However, it remains an open question to what extent this connection is mathematically sound -- it is a commonly encountered misbelief that the kernel behavior of wide neural networks emerges irrespective of the loss function it is trained on. In this paper, we bridge the gap between the NTK and self-supervised learning, focusing on two-layer neural networks trained under the Barlow Twins loss. We prove that the NTK of Barlow Twins indeed becomes constant as the width of the network approaches infinity. Our analysis technique is a bit different from previous works on the NTK and may be of independent interest. Overall, our work provides a first justification for the use of classic kernel theory to understand self-supervised learning of wide neural networks. Building on this result, we derive generalization error bounds for kernelized Barlow Twins and connect them to neural networks of finite width.

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease that impairs mobility and safety by increasing the risk of falls. An effective FOG detection system must be accurate, real-time, and deployable in free-living environments to enable timely interventions. However, existing detection methods face challenges due to (1) intra- and inter-patient variability, (2) subject-specific training, (3) using multiple sensors in FOG dominant locations (e.g., ankles) leading to high failure points, (4) centralized, non-adaptive learning frameworks that sacrifice patient privacy and prevent collaborative model refinement across populations and disease progression, and (5) most systems are tested in controlled settings, limiting their real-world applicability for continuous in-home monitoring. Addressing these gaps, we present FOGSense, a real-world deployable FOG detection system designed for uncontrolled, free-living conditions using only a single sensor. FOGSense uses Gramian Angular Field (GAF) transformations and privacy-preserving federated deep learning to capture temporal and spatial gait patterns missed by traditional methods with a low false positive rate. We evaluated our system using a public Parkinson's dataset collected in a free-living environment. FOGSense improves accuracy by 10.4% over a single-axis accelerometer, reduces failure points compared to multi-sensor systems, and demonstrates robustness to missing values. The federated architecture allows personalized model adaptation and efficient smartphone synchronization during off-peak hours, making it effective for long-term monitoring as symptoms evolve. Overall, FOGSense achieved a 22.2% improvement in F1-score and a 74.53% reduction in false positive rate compared to state-of-the-art methods, along with enhanced sensitivity for FOG episode detection.

Abstract: Multiphysics simulation, which models the interactions between multiple physical processes, and multi-component simulation of complex structures are critical in fields like nuclear and aerospace engineering. Previous studies use numerical solvers or ML-based surrogate models for these simulations. However, multiphysics simulations typically require integrating multiple specialized solvers-each for a specific physical process-into a coupled program, which introduces significant development challenges. Furthermore, existing numerical algorithms struggle with highly complex large-scale structures in multi-component simulations. Here we propose compositional Multiphysics and Multi-component PDE Simulation with Diffusion models (M2PDE) to overcome these challenges. During diffusion-based training, M2PDE learns energy functions modeling the conditional probability of one physical process/component conditioned on other processes/components. In inference, M2PDE generates coupled multiphysics and multi-component solutions by sampling from the joint probability distribution. We evaluate M2PDE on two multiphysics tasks-reaction-diffusion and nuclear thermal coupling-where it achieves more accurate predictions than surrogate models in challenging scenarios. We then apply it to a multi-component prismatic fuel element problem, demonstrating that M2PDE scales from single-component training to a 64-component structure and outperforms existing domain-decomposition and graph-based approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/M2PDE.

Abstract: Predicting Bitcoin price remains a challenging problem due to the high volatility and complex non-linear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.

Abstract: The contextual bandit problem, where agents arrive sequentially with personal contexts and the system adapts its arm allocation decisions accordingly, has recently garnered increasing attention for enabling more personalized outcomes. However, in many healthcare and recommendation applications, agents have private profiles and may misreport their contexts to gain from the system. For example, in adaptive clinical trials, where hospitals sequentially recruit volunteers to test multiple new treatments and adjust plans based on volunteers' reported profiles such as symptoms and interim data, participants may misreport severe side effects like allergy and nausea to avoid perceived suboptimal treatments. We are the first to study this issue of private context misreporting in a stochastic contextual bandit game between the system and non-repeated agents. We show that traditional low-regret algorithms, such as UCB family algorithms and Thompson sampling, fail to ensure truthful reporting and can result in linear regret in the worst case, while traditional truthful algorithms like explore-then-commit (ETC) and $\epsilon$-greedy algorithm incur sublinear but high regret. We propose a mechanism that uses a linear program to ensure truthfulness while minimizing deviation from Thompson sampling, yielding an $O(\ln T)$ frequentist regret. Our numerical experiments further demonstrate strong performance in multiple contexts and across other distribution families.

Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.

<title>Unveiling the Mechanisms of Explicit CoT Training: How CoT Enhances Reasoning Generalization</title>

Abstract: The integration of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into training large language models (LLMs) has advanced their reasoning capabilities, yet the mechanisms by which CoT enhances generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates (1) \textit{how} CoT training reshapes internal model representations and (2) \textit{why} it improves both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning generalization. Through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, we derive the following key insights. \textbf{1)} Structural Advantage: CoT training internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Notably, CoT-trained models resolve intermediate results at shallower layers compared to non-CoT counterparts, freeing up deeper layers to specialize in subsequent reasoning steps. \textbf{2)} Theoretical Analysis: the information-theoretic generalization bounds via distributional divergence can be decomposed into ID and OOD components. While ID error diminishes with sufficient training regardless of CoT, OOD error critically depends on CoT: Non-CoT training fails to generalize to OOD samples due to unseen reasoning patterns, whereas CoT training achieves near-perfect OOD generalization by mastering subtasks and reasoning compositions during training. The identified mechanisms explain our experimental results: CoT training accelerates convergence and enhances generalization from ID to both ID and OOD scenarios while maintaining robust performance even with tolerable noise. These findings are further validated on complex real-world datasets. This paper offers valuable insights for designing CoT strategies to enhance LLM reasoning robustness.

Abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to learn a policy by exploiting a dynamics model derived from an existing dataset. Applying conservative quantification to the dynamics model, most existing works on MORL generate trajectories that approximate the real data distribution to facilitate policy learning by using current information (e.g., the state and action at time step $t$). However, these works neglect the impact of historical information on environmental dynamics, leading to the generation of unreliable trajectories that may not align with the real data distribution. In this paper, we propose a new MORL algorithm \textbf{R}eliability-guaranteed \textbf{T}ransformer (RT), which can eliminate unreliable trajectories by calculating the cumulative reliability of the generated trajectory (i.e., using a weighted variational distance away from the real data). Moreover, by sampling candidate actions with high rewards, RT can efficiently generate high-return trajectories from the existing offline data. We theoretically prove the performance guarantees of RT in policy learning, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness against state-of-the-art model-based methods on several benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization drives the unprecedented performance of modern deep neural network models across diverse applications. Adaptive algorithms have accelerated neural network training due to their rapid convergence rates; however, they struggle to find ``flat minima" reliably, resulting in suboptimal generalization compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By revisiting various adaptive algorithms' mechanisms, we propose the Frankenstein optimizer, which combines their advantages. The proposed Frankenstein dynamically adjusts first- and second-momentum coefficients according to the optimizer's current state to directly maintain consistent learning dynamics and immediately reflect sudden gradient changes. Extensive experiments across several research domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, few-shot learning, and scientific simulations show that Frankenstein surpasses existing adaptive algorithms and SGD empirically regarding convergence speed and generalization performance. Furthermore, this research deepens our understanding of adaptive algorithms through centered kernel alignment analysis and loss landscape visualization during the learning process.

Abstract: Reactor physics is the study of neutron properties, focusing on using models to examine the interactions between neutrons and materials in nuclear reactors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant contributions to reactor physics, e.g., in operational simulations, safety design, real-time monitoring, core management and maintenance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of AI approaches in reactor physics, especially considering the category of Machine Learning (ML), with the aim of describing the application scenarios, frontier topics, unsolved challenges and future research directions. From equation solving and state parameter prediction to nuclear industry applications, this paper provides a step-by-step overview of ML methods applied to steady-state, transient and combustion problems. Most literature works achieve industry-demanded models by enhancing the efficiency of deterministic methods or correcting uncertainty methods, which leads to successful applications. However, research on ML methods in reactor physics is somewhat fragmented, and the ability to generalize models needs to be strengthened. Progress is still possible, especially in addressing theoretical challenges and enhancing industrial applications such as building surrogate models and digital twins.

Abstract: Transformers with linear attention offer significant computational advantages over softmax-based transformers but often suffer from degraded performance. The symmetric power (sympow) transformer, a particular type of linear transformer, addresses some of this performance gap by leveraging symmetric tensor embeddings, achieving comparable performance to softmax transformers. However, the finite capacity of the recurrent state in sympow transformers limits their ability to retain information, leading to performance degradation when scaling the training or evaluation context length. To address this issue, we propose the conformal-sympow transformer, which dynamically frees up capacity using data-dependent multiplicative gating and adaptively stores information using data-dependent rotary embeddings. Preliminary experiments on the LongCrawl64 dataset demonstrate that conformal-sympow overcomes the limitations of sympow transformers, achieving robust performance across scaled training and evaluation contexts.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from rewards treated as unnormalized distributions. Previous works in this framework often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using drug-like molecule datasets, which teaches A-GFNs about inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further implement a goal-conditioned finetuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on a subset of ZINC dataset, and by employing robust evaluation metrics we show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods for a wide range of drug design tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the integration of additional information sources into a Bayesian optimization framework while ensuring that safety constraints are satisfied. The interdependencies between these information sources are modeled using an unknown correlation matrix. We explore how uniform error bounds must be adjusted to maintain constraint satisfaction throughout the optimization process, considering both Bayesian and frequentist statistical perspectives. This is achieved by appropriately scaling the error bounds based on a confidence interval that can be estimated from the data. Furthermore, the efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark functions and a controller parameter optimization problem. Our results highlight a significant improvement in sample efficiency, demonstrating the methods suitability for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate functions.

Abstract: The era of foundation models has revolutionized AI research, yet Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale graph corpora. Traditional graph data synthesis techniques primarily focus on simplistic structural operations, lacking the capacity to generate semantically rich nodes with meaningful textual attributes: a critical limitation for real-world applications. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional text generation capabilities, their direct application to graph synthesis is impeded by context window limitations, hallucination phenomena, and structural consistency challenges. To address these issues, we introduce GraphMaster, the first multi-agent framework specifically designed for graph data synthesis in data-limited environments. GraphMaster orchestrates four specialized LLM agents (Manager, Perception, Enhancement, and Evaluation) that collaboratively optimize the synthesis process through iterative refinement, ensuring both semantic coherence and structural integrity. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we create new data-limited "Sub" variants of six standard graph benchmarks, specifically designed to test synthesis capabilities under realistic constraints. Additionally, we develop a novel interpretability assessment framework that combines human evaluation with a principled Grassmannian manifold-based analysis, providing both qualitative and quantitative measures of semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphMaster significantly outperforms traditional synthesis methods across multiple datasets, establishing a strong foundation for advancing GFMs in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Tabular data analysis presents unique challenges due to its heterogeneous feature types, missing values, and complex interactions. While traditional machine learning methods, such as gradient boosting, often outperform deep learning approaches, recent advancements in neural architectures offer promising alternatives. This paper introduces TabKAN, a novel framework that advances tabular data modeling using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike conventional deep learning models, KANs leverge learnable activation functions on edges, which improve both interpretability and training efficiency. Our contributions include: (1) the introduction of modular KAN-based architectures for tabular data analysis, (2) the development of a transfer learning framework for KAN models that supports knowledge transfer between domains, (3) the development of model-specific interpretability for tabular data learning, which reduces dependence on post hoc and model-agnostic analysis, and (4) comprehensive evaluation of vanilla supervised learning across binary and multi-class classification tasks. Through extensive benchmarking on diverse public datasets, TabKAN demonstrates superior performance in supervised learning while significantly outperforming classical and Transformer-based models in transfer learning scenarios. Our findings highlight the advantage of KAN-based architectures in transferring knowledge across domains and narrowing the gap between traditional machine learning and deep learning for structured data.

Abstract: Recently, slow-thinking systems like GPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated great potential in solving challenging problems through explicit reflection. They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a rethinking trigger token to the end of rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse to achieve 80.4%, 63.5% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MathVision, MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with OpenAI-o1. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of our approaches.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising performance in graph analysis. Nevertheless, the inference process of GNNs remains costly, hindering their applications for large graphs. This paper proposes inference-friendly graph compression (IFGC), a graph compression scheme to accelerate GNNs inference. Given a graph $G$ and a GNN $M$, an IFGC computes a small compressed graph $G_c$, to best preserve the inference results of $M$ over $G$, such that the result can be directly inferred by accessing $G_c$ with no or little decompression cost. (1) We characterize IFGC with a class of inference equivalence relation. The relation captures the node pairs in $G$ that are not distinguishable for GNN inference. (2) We introduce three practical specifications of IFGC for representative GNNs: structural preserving compression (SPGC), which computes $G_c$ that can be directly processed by GNN inference without decompression; ($\alpha$, $r$)-compression, that allows for a configurable trade-off between compression ratio and inference quality, and anchored compression that preserves inference results for specific nodes of interest. For each scheme, we introduce compression and inference algorithms with guarantees of efficiency and quality of the inferred results. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse sets of large-scale graphs, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our graph compression approaches.

Abstract: The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.

Abstract: While non-prehensile manipulation (e.g., controlled pushing/poking) constitutes a foundational robotic skill, its learning remains challenging due to the high sensitivity to complex physical interactions involving friction and restitution. To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.

<title>Neural operators struggle to learn complex PDEs in pedestrian mobility: Hughes model case study</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of neural operators in learning solutions for a Hughes model, a first-order hyperbolic conservation law system for crowd dynamics. The model couples a Fokker-Planck equation representing pedestrian density with a Hamilton-Jacobi-type (eikonal) equation. This Hughes model belongs to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems that often exhibit complex solution structures, including shocks and discontinuities. In this study, we assess the performance of three state-of-the-art neural operators (Fourier Neural Operator, Wavelet Neural Operator, and Multiwavelet Neural Operator) in various challenging scenarios. Specifically, we consider (1) discontinuous and Gaussian initial conditions and (2) diverse boundary conditions, while also examining the impact of different numerical schemes.
  Our results show that these neural operators perform well in easy scenarios with fewer discontinuities in the initial condition, yet they struggle in complex scenarios with multiple initial discontinuities and dynamic boundary conditions, even when trained specifically on such complex samples. The predicted solutions often appear smoother, resulting in a reduction in total variation and a loss of important physical features. This smoothing behavior is similar to issues discussed by Daganzo (1995), where models that introduce artificial diffusion were shown to miss essential features such as shock waves in hyperbolic systems. These results suggest that current neural operator architectures may introduce unintended regularization effects that limit their ability to capture transport dynamics governed by discontinuities. They also raise concerns about generalizing these methods to traffic applications where shock preservation is essential.

<title>Overparametrized linear dimensionality reductions: From projection pursuit to two-layer neural networks</title>

Abstract: Given a cloud of $n$ data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, consider all projections onto $m$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and, for each such projection, the empirical distribution of the projected points. What does this collection of probability distributions look like when $n,d$ grow large?
  We consider this question under the null model in which the points are i.i.d. standard Gaussian vectors, focusing on the asymptotic regime in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n/d\to\alpha\in (0,\infty)$, while $m$ is fixed. Denoting by $\mathscr{F}_{m, \alpha}$ the set of probability distributions in $\mathbb{R}^m$ that arise as low-dimensional projections in this limit, we establish new inner and outer bounds on $\mathscr{F}_{m, \alpha}$. In particular, we characterize the Wasserstein radius of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ up to constant multiplicative factors, and determine it exactly for $m=1$. We also prove sharp bounds in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence and R\'{e}nyi information dimension.
  The previous question has application to unsupervised learning methods, such as projection pursuit and independent component analysis. We introduce a version of the same problem that is relevant for supervised learning, and prove a sharp Wasserstein radius bound. As an application, we establish an upper bound on the interpolation threshold of two-layers neural networks with $m$ hidden neurons.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has become a powerful framework for estimation under uncertainty, offering strong out-of-sample performance and principled regularization. In this paper, we propose a DRO-based method for linear regression and address a central question: how to optimally choose the robustness radius, which controls the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. Focusing on high-dimensional settings where the dimension and the number of samples are both large and comparable in size, we employ tools from high-dimensional asymptotic statistics to precisely characterize the estimation error of the resulting estimator. Remarkably, this error can be recovered by solving a simple convex-concave optimization problem involving only four scalar variables. This characterization enables efficient selection of the radius that minimizes the estimation error. In doing so, it achieves the same effect as cross-validation, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Numerical experiments confirm that our theoretical predictions closely match empirical performance and that the optimal radius selected through our method aligns with that chosen by cross-validation, highlighting both the accuracy and the practical benefits of our approach.

Abstract: It is imperative to safeguard computer applications and information systems against the growing number of cyber-attacks. Automated software testing tools can be developed to quickly analyze many lines of code and detect vulnerabilities by generating function-specific testing data. This process draws similarities to the constrained adversarial examples generated by adversarial machine learning methods, so there could be significant benefits to the integration of these methods in testing tools to identify possible attack vectors. Therefore, this literature review is focused on the current state-of-the-art of constrained data generation approaches applied for adversarial learning and software testing, aiming to guide researchers and developers to enhance their software testing tools with adversarial testing methods and improve the resilience and robustness of their information systems. The found approaches were systematized, and the advantages and limitations of those specific for white-box, grey-box, and black-box testing were analyzed, identifying research gaps and opportunities to automate the testing tools with data generated by adversarial attacks.

Abstract: The agility of animals, particularly in complex activities such as running, turning, jumping, and backflipping, stands as an exemplar for robotic system design. Transferring this suite of behaviors to legged robotic systems introduces essential inquiries: How can a robot learn multiple locomotion behaviors simultaneously? How can the robot execute these tasks with a smooth transition? How to integrate these skills for wide-range applications? This paper introduces the Versatile Instructable Motion prior (VIM) - a Reinforcement Learning framework designed to incorporate a range of agile locomotion tasks suitable for advanced robotic applications. Our framework enables legged robots to learn diverse agile low-level skills by imitating animal motions and manually designed motions. Our Functionality reward guides the robot's ability to adopt varied skills, and our Stylization reward ensures that robot motions align with reference motions. Our evaluations of the VIM framework span both simulation and the real world. Our framework allows a robot to concurrently learn diverse agile locomotion skills using a single learning-based controller in the real world.

Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of learning quantum processes from quantum statistical queries. We focus on two fundamental learning tasks in this new access model: shadow tomography of quantum processes and process tomography with respect to diamond distance. For the former, we present an efficient average-case algorithm along with a nearly matching lower bound with respect to the number of observables to be predicted. For the latter, we present average-case query complexity lower bounds for learning classes of unitaries. We obtain an exponential lower bound for learning unitary 2-designs and a doubly exponential lower bound for Haar-random unitaries. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our access model by applying our learning algorithm to attack an authentication protocol using Classical-Readout Quantum Physically Unclonable Functions, partially addressing an important open question in quantum hardware security.

arXiv:2310.04606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses challenges in robust transfer learning stemming from ambiguity in Bayes classifiers and weak transferable signals between the target and source distribution. We introduce a novel quantity called the ''ambiguity level'' that measures the discrepancy between the target and source regression functions, propose a simple transfer learning procedure, and establish a general theorem that shows how this new quantity is related to the transferability of learning in terms of risk improvements. Our proposed ''Transfer Around Boundary'' (TAB) model, with a threshold balancing the performance of target and source data, is shown to be both efficient and robust, improving classification while avoiding negative transfer. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the TAB model on non-parametric classification and logistic regression tasks, achieving upper bounds which are optimal up to logarithmic factors. Simulation studies lend further support to the effectiveness of TAB. We also provide simple approaches to bound the excess misclassification error without the need for specialized knowledge in transfer learning.

Abstract: Clustering of time series is a well-studied problem, with applications ranging from quantitative, personalized models of metabolism obtained from metabolite concentrations to state discrimination in quantum information theory. We consider a variant, where given a set of trajectories and a number of parts, we jointly partition the set of trajectories and learn linear dynamical system (LDS) models for each part, so as to minimize the maximum error across all the models. We present globally convergent methods and EM heuristics, accompanied by promising computational results. The key highlight of this method is that it does not require a predefined hidden state dimension but instead provides an upper bound. Additionally, it offers guidance for determining regularization in the system identification.

Abstract: Hypergraphs represent complex systems involving interactions among more than two entities and allow the investigation of higher-order structure and dynamics in complex systems. Node attribute data, which often accompanies network data, can enhance the inference of community structure in complex systems. While mixed-membership stochastic block models have been employed to infer community structure in hypergraphs, they complicate the visualization and interpretation of inferred community structure by assuming that nodes may possess soft community memberships. In this study, we propose a framework, HyperNEO, that combines mixed-membership stochastic block models for hypergraphs with dimensionality reduction methods. Our approach generates a node layout that largely preserves the community memberships of nodes. We evaluate our framework on both synthetic and empirical hypergraphs with node attributes. We expect our framework will broaden the investigation and understanding of higher-order community structure in complex systems.

Abstract: Routes represent an integral part of triggering emotions in drivers. Navigation systems allow users to choose a navigation strategy, such as the fastest or shortest route. However, they do not consider the driver's emotional well-being. We present HappyRouting, a novel navigation-based empathic car interface guiding drivers through real-world traffic while evoking positive emotions. We propose design considerations, derive a technical architecture, and implement a routing optimization framework. Our contribution is a machine learning-based generated emotion map layer, predicting emotions along routes based on static and dynamic contextual data. We evaluated HappyRouting in a real-world driving study (N=13), finding that happy routes increase subjectively perceived valence by 11% (p=.007). Although happy routes take 1.25 times longer on average, participants perceived the happy route as shorter, presenting an emotion-enhanced alternative to today's fastest routing mechanisms. We discuss how emotion-based routing can be integrated into navigation apps, promoting emotional well-being for mobility use.

arXiv:2402.07407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.

Abstract: Average treatment effect estimation is the most central problem in causal inference with application to numerous disciplines. While many estimation strategies have been proposed in the literature, the statistical optimality of these methods has still remained an open area of investigation, especially in regimes where these methods do not achieve parametric rates. In this paper, we adopt the recently introduced structure-agnostic framework of statistical lower bounds, which poses no structural properties on the nuisance functions other than access to black-box estimators that achieve some statistical estimation rate. This framework is particularly appealing when one is only willing to consider estimation strategies that use non-parametric regression and classification oracles as black-box sub-processes. Within this framework, we prove the statistical optimality of the celebrated and widely used doubly robust estimators for both the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) and the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT), as well as weighted variants of the former, which arise in policy evaluation.

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have demonstrated promising results across various applications within seismology and earthquake engineering. These models rely primarily on utilizing ground motion records for tasks such as earthquake event classification, localization, earthquake early warning systems, and structural health monitoring. However, the extent to which these models truly extract meaningful patterns from these complex time-series signals remains underexplored. In this study, our objective is to evaluate the degree to which auxiliary information, such as seismic phase arrival times or seismic station distribution within a network, dominates the process of deep learning from ground motion records, potentially hindering its effectiveness. Our experimental results reveal a strong dependence on the highly correlated Primary (P) and Secondary (S) phase arrival times. These findings expose a critical gap in the current research landscape, highlighting the lack of robust methodologies for deep learning from single-station ground motion recordings that do not rely on auxiliary inputs.

Abstract: Scaling multi-dimensional transformers to long sequences is indispensable across various domains. However, the challenges of large memory requirements and slow speeds of such sequences necessitate sequence parallelism. All existing approaches fall under the category of embedded sequence parallelism, which are limited to shard along a single sequence dimension, thereby introducing significant communication overhead. However, the nature of multi-dimensional transformers involves independent calculations across multiple sequence dimensions. To this end, we propose Dynamic Sequence Parallelism (DSP) as a novel abstraction of sequence parallelism. DSP dynamically switches the parallel dimension among all sequences according to the computation stage with efficient resharding strategy. DSP offers significant reductions in communication costs, adaptability across modules, and ease of implementation with minimal constraints. Experimental evaluations demonstrate DSP's superiority over state-of-the-art embedded sequence parallelism methods by remarkable throughput improvements ranging from 32.2% to 10x, with less than 25% communication volume.

Abstract: How physical networks of neurons, bound by spatio-temporal locality constraints, can perform efficient credit assignment, remains, to a large extent, an open question. In machine learning, the answer is almost universally given by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time. However, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible assumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality. Alternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning only partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due to prohibitive storage requirements. We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework for fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical networks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local mismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and parameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be interpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of backpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with continuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic plasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to enable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as well as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with respect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of information propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of time-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a spatio-temporal convolution. For the backward computation, it permits the temporal inversion of feedback signals, which consequently approximate the adjoint variables necessary for useful parameter updates.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.

Abstract: Biological nervous systems constitute important sources of inspiration towards computers that are faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient. Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.

Abstract: We consider Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) with One Sided Noncompliance that arise in applications such as digital recommendations and adaptive medical trials. These are settings where decision makers encourage individuals to take treatments over time, but adapt encouragements based on previous encouragements, treatments, states, and outcomes. Importantly, individuals may not comply with encouragements based on unobserved confounders. For settings with binary treatments and encouragements, we provide nonparametric identification, estimation, and inference for Dynamic Local Average Treatment Effects (LATEs), which are expected values of multiple time period treatment effect contrasts for the respective complier subpopulations. Under One Sided Noncompliance and sequential extensions of the assumptions in Imbens and Angrist (1994), we show that one can identify Dynamic LATEs that correspond to treating at single time steps. In Staggered Adoption settings, we show that the assumptions are sufficient to identify Dynamic LATEs for treating in multiple time periods. Moreover, this result extends to any setting where the effect of a treatment in one period is uncorrelated with the compliance event in a subsequent period.

Abstract: Given $d$-dimensional standard Gaussian vectors $\boldsymbol{x}_1,\dots, \boldsymbol{x}_n$, we consider the set of all empirical distributions of its $m$-dimensional projections, for $m$ a fixed constant. Diaconis and Freedman (1984) proved that, if $n/d\to \infty$, all such distributions converge to the standard Gaussian distribution. In contrast, we study the proportional asymptotics, whereby $n,d\to \infty$ with $n/d\to \alpha \in (0, \infty)$. In this case, the projection of the data points along a typical random subspace is again Gaussian, but the set $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of all probability distributions that are asymptotically feasible as $m$-dimensional projections contains non-Gaussian distributions corresponding to exceptional subspaces.
  Non-rigorous methods from statistical physics yield an indirect characterization of $\mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ in terms of a generalized Parisi formula. Motivated by the goal of putting this formula on a rigorous basis, and to understand whether these projections can be found efficiently, we study the subset $\mathscr{F}^{\rm alg}_{m,\alpha}\subseteq \mathscr{F}_{m,\alpha}$ of distributions that can be realized by a class of iterative algorithms. We prove that this set is characterized by a certain stochastic optimal control problem, and obtain a dual characterization of this problem in terms of a variational principle that extends Parisi's formula.
  As a byproduct, we obtain computationally achievable values for a class of random optimization problems including `generalized spherical perceptron' models.

<title>Deep Implicit Optimization enables Robust Learnable Features for Deformable Image Registration</title>

Abstract: Deep Learning in Image Registration (DLIR) methods have been tremendously successful in image registration due to their speed and ability to incorporate weak label supervision at training time. However, existing DLIR methods forego many of the benefits and invariances of optimization methods. The lack of a task-specific inductive bias in DLIR methods leads to suboptimal performance, especially in the presence of domain shift. Our method aims to bridge this gap between statistical learning and optimization by explicitly incorporating optimization as a layer in a deep network. A deep network is trained to predict multi-scale dense feature images that are registered using a black box iterative optimization solver. This optimal warp is then used to minimize image and label alignment errors. By implicitly differentiating end-to-end through an iterative optimization solver, we explicitly exploit invariances of the correspondence matching problem induced by the optimization, while learning registration and label-aware features, and guaranteeing the warp functions to be a local minima of the registration objective in the feature space. Our framework shows excellent performance on in-domain datasets, and is agnostic to domain shift such as anisotropy and varying intensity profiles. For the first time, our method allows switching between arbitrary transformation representations (free-form to diffeomorphic) at test time with zero retraining. End-to-end feature learning also facilitates interpretability of features and arbitrary test-time regularization, which is not possible with existing DLIR methods.

Abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, and potentially introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here, we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation. Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.

Abstract: The training phase of machine learning models is a delicate step, especially in cybersecurity contexts. Recent research has surfaced a series of insidious training-time attacks that inject backdoors in models designed for security classification tasks without altering the training labels. With this work, we propose new techniques that leverage insights in cybersecurity threat models to effectively mitigate these clean-label poisoning attacks, while preserving the model utility. By performing density-based clustering on a carefully chosen feature subspace, and progressively isolating the suspicious clusters through a novel iterative scoring procedure, our defensive mechanism can mitigate the attacks without requiring many of the common assumptions in the existing backdoor defense literature. To show the generality of our proposed mitigation, we evaluate it on two clean-label model-agnostic attacks on two different classic cybersecurity data modalities: network flows classification and malware classification, using gradient boosting and neural network models.

Abstract: Estimating a distribution given access to its unnormalized density is pivotal in Bayesian inference, where the posterior is generally known only up to an unknown normalizing constant. Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are the predominant tools for this task; however, both are often challenging to apply reliably, particularly when the posterior has complex geometry. Here, we introduce Soft Contrastive Variational Inference (SoftCVI), which allows a family of variational objectives to be derived through a contrastive estimation framework. The approach parameterizes a classifier in terms of a variational distribution, reframing the inference task as a contrastive estimation problem aiming to identify a single true posterior sample among a set of samples. Despite this framing, we do not require positive or negative samples, but rather learn by sampling the variational distribution and computing ground truth soft classification labels from the unnormalized posterior itself. The objectives have zero variance gradient when the variational approximation is exact, without the need for specialized gradient estimators. We empirically investigate the performance on a variety of Bayesian inference tasks, using both simple (e.g. normal) and expressive (normalizing flow) variational distributions. We find that SoftCVI can be used to form objectives which are stable to train and mass-covering, frequently outperforming inference with other variational approaches.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language processing tasks, they still struggle with generating logically sound arguments, resulting in potential risks such as spreading misinformation. To address this issue, we introduce FIPO, a fallacy-informed framework that leverages preference optimization methods to steer LLMs toward logically sound arguments. FIPO includes a classification loss, to capture the fine-grained information on fallacy types. Our results on argumentation datasets show that our method reduces the fallacy errors by up to 17.5%. Furthermore, our human evaluation results indicate that the quality of the generated arguments by our method significantly outperforms the fine-tuned baselines, as well as other preference optimization methods, such as DPO. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring models are aware of logical fallacies for effective argument generation. Our code is available at github.com/lucamouchel/Logical-Fallacies.

Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Moreover, we demonstrate improved robustness during MD simulations of the MLIP models trained with the proposed weakly supervised loss. Finally, our approach improves the fine-tuning of foundation models on sparse, highly accurate ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various fields, from natural language processing to sectors like medicine and finance. However, despite their rapid proliferation, the applications of LLMs in telecommunications remain limited, often relying on general-purpose models that lack domain-specific specialization. This lack of specialization results in underperformance, particularly when dealing with telecommunications-specific technical terminology and their associated mathematical representations. This paper addresses this gap by first creating and disseminating Tele-Data, a comprehensive dataset of telecommunications material curated from relevant sources, and Tele-Eval, a large-scale question-and-answer dataset tailored to the domain. Through extensive experiments, we explore the most effective training techniques for adapting LLMs to the telecommunications domain, ranging from examining the division of expertise across various telecommunications aspects to employing parameter-efficient techniques. We also investigate how models of different sizes behave during adaptation and analyze the impact of their training data on this behavior. Leveraging these findings, we develop and open-source Tele-LLMs, the first series of language models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, specifically tailored for telecommunications. Our evaluations demonstrate that these models outperform their general-purpose counterparts on Tele-Eval and telecommunications-related literature tasks while retaining their previously acquired capabilities, thus avoiding the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon.

Abstract: Objective: To improve prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied to an integrated clinical and claims dataset of varying observation windows, supported by explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and reduce bias.
  Materials and Methods: We utilized data about 10,326 CKD patients, combining their clinical and claims information from 2009 to 2018. Following data preprocessing, cohort identification, and feature engineering, we evaluated multiple statistical, ML and DL models using data extracted from five distinct observation windows. Feature importance and Shapley value analysis were employed to understand key predictors. Models were tested for robustness, clinical relevance, misclassification errors and bias issues.
  Results: Integrated data models outperformed those using single data sources, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieving the highest AUC (0.93) and F1 score (0.65). A 24-month observation window was identified as optimal for balancing early detection and prediction accuracy. The 2021 eGFR equation improved prediction accuracy and reduced racial bias, notably for African American patients. Discussion: Improved ESRD prediction accuracy, results interpretability and bias mitigation strategies presented in this study have the potential to significantly enhance CKD and ESRD management, support targeted early interventions and reduce healthcare disparities.
  Conclusion: This study presents a robust framework for predicting ESRD outcomes in CKD patients, improving clinical decision-making and patient care through multi-sourced, integrated data and AI/ML methods. Future research will expand data integration and explore the application of this framework to other chronic diseases.

Abstract: Motivated by information geometry, a distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is advocated. Starting with sequences of Markov chains the Bhattacharyya angle is advocated as the natural tool for comparing both short and long term Markov chain runs. Bounds on the convergence of the distance and mixing times are derived. Guided by the desire to compare different Markov chain models, especially in the setting of healthcare processes, a new distance function on the space of stochastic matrices is presented. It is a true distance measure which has a closed form and is efficient to implement for numerical evaluation. In the case of ergodic Markov chains, it is shown that considering either the Bhattacharyya angle on Markov sequences or the new stochastic matrix distance leads to the same distance between models.

<title>From Gradient Clipping to Normalization for Heavy Tailed SGD</title>

Abstract: Recent empirical evidence indicates that many machine learning applications involve heavy-tailed gradient noise, which challenges the standard assumptions of bounded variance in stochastic optimization. Gradient clipping has emerged as a popular tool to handle this heavy-tailed noise, as it achieves good performance in this setting both theoretically and practically. However, our current theoretical understanding of non-convex gradient clipping has three main shortcomings. First, the theory hinges on large, increasing clipping thresholds, which are in stark contrast to the small constant clipping thresholds employed in practice. Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge of problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. Lastly, even with this knowledge, current sampling complexity upper bounds for the method are sub-optimal in nearly all parameters. To address these issues, we study convergence of Normalized SGD (NSGD). First, we establish a parameter-free sample complexity for NSGD of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. Furthermore, we prove tightness of this result, by providing a matching algorithm-specific lower bound. In the setting where all problem parameters are known, we show this complexity is improved to $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\right)$, matching the previously known lower bound for all first-order methods in all problem dependent parameters. Finally, we establish high-probability convergence of NSGD with a mild logarithmic dependence on the failure probability. Our work complements the studies of gradient clipping under heavy tailed noise improving the sample complexities of existing algorithms and offering an alternative mechanism to achieve high probability convergence.

Abstract: This paper studies pricing of weather-derivative (WD) contracts on temperature and precipitation. For temperature-linked strangles in Toronto and Chicago, we benchmark a harmonic-regression/ARMA model against a feed-forward neural network (NN), finding that the NN reduces out-of-sample mean-squared error (MSE) and materially shifts December fair values relative to both the time-series model and the industry-standard Historic Burn Approach (HBA).
  For precipitation, we employ a compound Poisson--Gamma framework: shape and scale parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and via a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on 30-day rainfall sequences spanning multiple seasons. The CNN adaptively learns season-specific $(\alpha,\beta)$ mappings, thereby capturing heterogeneity across regimes that static i.i.d.\ fits miss. At valuation, we assume days are i.i.d.\ $\Gamma(\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta})$ within each regime and apply a mean-count approximation (replacing the Poisson count by its mean ($n\hat{\lambda}$) to derive closed-form strangle prices.
  Exploratory analysis of 1981--2023 NASA POWER data confirms pronounced seasonal heterogeneity in $(\alpha,\beta)$ between summer and winter, demonstrating that static global fits are inadequate. Back-testing on Toronto and Chicago grids shows that our regime-adaptive CNN yields competitive valuations and underscores how model choice can shift strangle prices. Payoffs are evaluated analytically when possible and by simulation elsewhere, enabling a like-for-like comparison of forecasting and valuation methods.

Abstract: The successive projection algorithm (SPA) is a workhorse algorithm to learn the $r$ vertices of the convex hull of a set of $(r-1)$-dimensional data points, a.k.a. a latent simplex, which has numerous applications in data science. In this paper, we revisit the robustness to noise of SPA and several of its variants. In particular, when $r \geq 3$, we prove the tightness of the existing error bounds for SPA and for two more robust preconditioned variants of SPA. We also provide significantly improved error bounds for SPA, by a factor proportional to the conditioning of the $r$ vertices, in two special cases: for the first extracted vertex, and when $r \leq 2$. We then provide further improvements for the error bounds of a translated version of SPA proposed by Arora et al. (''A practical algorithm for topic modeling with provable guarantees'', ICML, 2013) in two special cases: for the first two extracted vertices, and when $r \leq 3$. Finally, we propose a new more robust variant of SPA that first shifts and lifts the data points in order to minimize the conditioning of the problem. We illustrate our results on synthetic data.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is the de facto standard for compressing large-scale models into smaller ones. Prior works have explored ever more complex KD strategies involving different objective functions, teacher-ensembles, and weight inheritance. In this work we explore an alternative, yet simple approach -- active data curation as effective distillation for contrastive multimodal pretraining. Our simple online batch selection method, ACID, outperforms strong KD baselines across various model-, data- and compute-configurations. Further, we find such an active data curation strategy to in fact be complementary to standard KD, and can be effectively combined to train highly performant inference-efficient models. Our simple and scalable pretraining framework, ACED, achieves state-of-the-art results across 27 zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks with upto 11% less inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate that our ACED models yield strong vision-encoders for training generative multimodal models in the LiT-Decoder setting, outperforming larger vision encoders for image-captioning and visual question-answering tasks.

Abstract: Achieving precise alignment between textual instructions and generated images in text-to-image generation is a significant challenge, particularly in rendering written text within images. Sate-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), Flux, and AuraFlow still struggle with accurate text depiction, resulting in misspelled or inconsistent text. We introduce a training-free method with minimal computational overhead that significantly enhances text rendering quality. Specifically, we introduce an overshooting sampler for pretrained rectified flow (RF) models, by alternating between over-simulating the learned ordinary differential equation (ODE) and reintroducing noise. Compared to the Euler sampler, the overshooting sampler effectively introduces an extra Langevin dynamics term that can help correct the compounding error from successive Euler steps and therefore improve the text rendering. However, when the overshooting strength is high, we observe over-smoothing artifacts on the generated images. To address this issue, we propose an Attention Modulated Overshooting sampler (AMO), which adaptively controls the strength of overshooting for each image patch according to their attention score with the text content. AMO demonstrates a 32.3% and 35.9% improvement in text rendering accuracy on SD3 and Flux without compromising overall image quality or increasing inference cost.

Abstract: We present LiDAR-EDIT, a novel paradigm for generating synthetic LiDAR data for autonomous driving. Our framework edits real-world LiDAR scans by introducing new object layouts while preserving the realism of the background environment. Compared to end-to-end frameworks that generate LiDAR point clouds from scratch, LiDAR-EDIT offers users full control over the object layout, including the number, type, and pose of objects, while keeping most of the original real-world background. Our method also provides object labels for the generated data. Compared to novel view synthesis techniques, our framework allows for the creation of counterfactual scenarios with object layouts significantly different from the original real-world scene. LiDAR-EDIT uses spherical voxelization to enforce correct LiDAR projective geometry in the generated point clouds by construction. During object removal and insertion, generative models are employed to fill the unseen background and object parts that were occluded in the original real LiDAR scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework produces realistic LiDAR scans with practical value for downstream tasks.

Abstract: We consider an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with unknown boundary conditions. Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a large dataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and a bulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data, we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensional structure in the expansion coefficients using an autoencoder, which provides a parametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We then train an operator network to map the expansion coefficients representing the boundary data to the finite element (FE) solution of the PDE. Finally, we connect the autoencoder's decoder to the operator network which enables us to solve the inverse problem by optimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space. We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method (FEM) in the linear setting and establish an optimal error estimate in the $H^1$-norm. The nonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Optimization is crucial for MEC networks to function efficiently and reliably, most of which are NP-hard and lack efficient approximation algorithms. This leads to a paucity of optimal solution, constraining the effectiveness of conventional deep learning approaches. Most existing learning-based methods necessitate extensive optimal data and fail to exploit the potential benefits of suboptimal data that can be obtained with greater efficiency and effectiveness. Taking the multi-server multi-user computation offloading (MSCO) problem, which is widely observed in systems like Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks, as a concrete scenario, we present a Graph Diffusion-based Solution Generation (GDSG) method. This approach is designed to work with suboptimal datasets while converging to the optimal solution large probably. We transform the optimization issue into distribution-learning and offer a clear explanation of learning from suboptimal training datasets. We build GDSG as a multi-task diffusion model utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to acquire the distribution of high-quality solutions. We use a simple and efficient heuristic approach to obtain a sufficient amount of training data composed entirely of suboptimal solutions. In our implementation, we enhance the backbone GNN and achieve improved generalization. GDSG also reaches nearly 100\% task orthogonality, ensuring no interference between the discrete and continuous generation tasks. We further reveal that this orthogonality arises from the diffusion-related training loss, rather than the neural network architecture itself. The experiments demonstrate that GDSG surpasses other benchmark methods on both the optimal and suboptimal training datasets. The MSCO datasets has open-sourced at this http URL, as well as the GDSG algorithm codes at https://github.com/qiyu3816/GDSG.

Abstract: Traditional sound design workflows rely on manual alignment of audio events to visual cues, as in Foley sound design, where everyday actions like footsteps or object interactions are recreated to match the on-screen motion. This process is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and lacks automation tools that preserve creative intent. Despite recent advances in vision-to-audio generation, producing temporally coherent and semantically controllable sound effects from video remains a major challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce FolAI, a two-stage generative framework that decouples the when and the what of sound synthesis, i.e., the temporal structure extraction and the semantically guided generation, respectively. In the first stage, we estimate a smooth control signal from the video that captures the motion intensity and rhythmic structure over time, serving as a temporal scaffold for the audio. In the second stage, a diffusion-based generative model produces sound effects conditioned both on this temporal envelope and on high-level semantic embeddings, provided by the user, that define the desired auditory content (e.g., material or action type). This modular design enables precise control over both timing and timbre, streamlining repetitive tasks while preserving creative flexibility in professional Foley workflows. Results on diverse visual contexts, such as footstep generation and action-specific sonorization, demonstrate that our model reliably produces audio that is temporally aligned with visual motion, semantically consistent with user intent, and perceptually realistic. These findings highlight the potential of FolAI as a controllable and modular solution for scalable, high-quality Foley sound synthesis in professional and interactive settings. Supplementary materials are accessible on our dedicated demo page at https://ispamm.github.io/FolAI.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revolutionized many fields, including healthcare. However, these advances raise significant privacy concerns, especially when pre-trained models fine-tuned and specialized on sensitive data can memorize and then expose and regurgitate personal information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving language modeling approach to address the problem of language models anonymization, and thus promote their sharing. Specifically, we propose both a Masking Language Modeling (MLM) methodology to specialize a BERT-like language model, and a Causal Language Modeling (CLM) methodology to specialize a GPT-like model that avoids the model from memorizing direct and indirect identifying information present in the training data. We have comprehensively evaluated our approaches using a medical dataset and compared them against different baselines. Our results indicate that by avoiding memorizing both direct and indirect identifiers during model specialization, our masking and causal language modeling schemes offer a good tradeoff for maintaining high privacy while retaining high utility.

Abstract: Connectionist approaches to machine learning, \emph{i.e.} neural networks, are enjoying a considerable vogue right now. However, these methods require large volumes of data and produce models that are uninterpretable to humans. An alternative framework that is compatible with neural networks and gradient-based learning, but explicitly models compositionality, is Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). VSAs are a family of algebras on high-dimensional vector representations. They arose in cognitive science from the need to unify neural processing and the kind of symbolic reasoning that humans perform. While machine learning methods have benefited from category-theoretical analyses, VSAs have not yet received similar treatment. In this paper, we present a first attempt at applying category theory to VSAs. Specifically, We generalise from vectors to co-presheaves, and describe VSA operations as the right Kan extensions of the external tensor product. This formalisation involves a proof that the right Kan extension in such cases can be expressed as simple, element-wise operations. We validate our formalisation with worked examples that connect to current VSA implementations, while suggesting new possible designs for VSAs.

Abstract: Anatomical landmark localization in 2D/3D images is a critical task in medical imaging. Although many general-purpose tools exist for landmark localization in classical computer vision tasks, such as pose estimation, they lack the specialized features and modularity necessary for anatomical landmark localization applications in the medical domain. Therefore, we introduce landmarker, a Python package built on PyTorch. The package provides a comprehensive, flexible toolkit for developing and evaluating landmark localization algorithms, supporting a range of methodologies, including static and adaptive heatmap regression. landmarker enhances the accuracy of landmark identification, streamlines research and development processes, and supports various image formats and preprocessing pipelines. Its modular design allows users to customize and extend the toolkit for specific datasets and applications, accelerating innovation in medical imaging. landmarker addresses a critical need for precision and customization in landmark localization tasks not adequately met by existing general-purpose pose estimation tools.

<title>DAOP: Data-Aware Offloading and Predictive Pre-Calculation for Efficient MoE Inference</title>

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, though highly effective for various machine learning tasks, face significant deployment challenges on memory-constrained devices. While GPUs offer fast inference, their limited memory compared to CPUs means not all experts can be stored on the GPU simultaneously, necessitating frequent, costly data transfers from CPU memory, often negating GPU speed advantages. To address this, we present DAOP, an on-device MoE inference engine to optimize parallel GPU-CPU execution. DAOP dynamically allocates experts between CPU and GPU based on per-sequence activation patterns, and selectively pre-calculates predicted experts on CPUs to minimize transfer latency. This approach enables efficient resource utilization across various expert cache ratios while maintaining model accuracy through a novel graceful degradation mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across various datasets show that DAOP outperforms traditional expert caching and prefetching methods by up to 8.20x and offloading techniques by 1.35x while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Images depicting complex, dynamic scenes are challenging to parse automatically, requiring both high-level comprehension of the overall situation and fine-grained identification of participating entities and their interactions. Current approaches use distinct methods tailored to sub-tasks such as Situation Recognition and detection of Human-Human and Human-Object Interactions. However, recent advances in image understanding have often leveraged web-scale vision-language (V&amp;L) representations to obviate task-specific engineering. In this work, we propose a framework for dynamic scene understanding tasks by leveraging knowledge from modern, frozen V&amp;L representations. By framing these tasks in a generic manner - as predicting and parsing structured text, or by directly concatenating representations to the input of existing models - we achieve state-of-the-art results while using a minimal number of trainable parameters relative to existing approaches. Moreover, our analysis of dynamic knowledge of these representations shows that recent, more powerful representations effectively encode dynamic scene semantics, making this approach newly possible.

Abstract: This study introduces a deep learning model based on the U-net architecture to reconstruct missing leads in electrocardiograms (ECGs). The model was trained to reconstruct 12-lead ECG data from reduced lead configurations using publicly available datasets. The results highlight the ability of the model to quantify the information content of each ECG lead and its inter-lead correlations. This has significant implications for optimizing lead selection in diagnostic scenarios, particularly in settings where complete 12-lead ECGs are impractical. In addition, the study provides insights into the physiological underpinnings of ECG signals and their propagation. The findings pave the way for advances in telemedicine, portable ECG devices, and personalized cardiac diagnostics by reducing redundancy and improving signal interpretation.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion models to downstream tasks often requires finetuning new models or gradient-based guidance at inference time to enable sampling from the reward-tilted posterior. In this work, we explore a simple inference-time gradient-free guidance approach, called controlled denoising (CoDe), that circumvents the need for differentiable guidance functions and model finetuning. CoDe is a blockwise sampling method applied during intermediate denoising steps, allowing for alignment with downstream rewards. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, CoDe offers a favorable trade-off between reward alignment, prompt instruction following, and inference cost, achieving a competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly used to automate or aid human decisions, yet recent research shows that these algorithms may exhibit bias across legally protected demographic groups. However, data on these groups may be unavailable to organizations or external auditors due to privacy legislation. This paper studies bias detection using an unsupervised clustering tool when data on demographic groups are unavailable. We collaborate with the Dutch Executive Agency for Education to audit an algorithm that was used to assign risk scores to college students at the national level in the Netherlands between 2012-2023. Our audit covers more than 250,000 students from the whole country. The unsupervised clustering tool highlights known disparities between students with a non-European migration background and Dutch origin. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) we assess bias in a real-world, large-scale and high-stakes decision-making process by a governmental organization; (2) we use simulation studies to highlight potential pitfalls of using the unsupervised clustering tool to detect true bias when demographic group data are unavailable and provide recommendations for valid inferences; (3) we provide the unsupervised clustering tool in an open-source library. Our work serves as a starting point for a deliberative assessment by human experts to evaluate potential discrimination in algorithmic-supported decision-making processes.

arXiv:2502.01860v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown significant promise in various software engineering (SE) tasks, including code generation, debugging, and requirement refinement. Despite these advances, existing evaluation frameworks are insufficient for assessing model performance in iterative, context-rich workflows characteristic of SE activities. To address this limitation, we introduce SE Arena, an interactive platform designed to evaluate FMs in SE tasks. SE Arena provides a transparent, open-source leaderboard, supports multi-round conversational workflows, and enables end-to-end model comparisons. The platform introduces novel metrics, including model consistency score that measures the consistency of model outputs through self-play matches, and conversation efficiency index that evaluates model performance while accounting for the number of interaction rounds required to reach conclusions. Moreover, SE Arena incorporates a new feature called RepoChat, which automatically injects repository-related context (e.g., issues, commits, pull requests) into the conversation, further aligning evaluations with real-world development processes. This paper outlines the design and capabilities of SE Arena, emphasizing its potential to advance the evaluation and practical application of FMs in software engineering.

<title>When Pre-trained Visual Representations Fall Short: Limitations in Visuo-Motor Robot Learning</title>

arXiv:2502.03270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs) into visuo-motor robot learning has emerged as a promising alternative to training visual encoders from scratch. However, PVRs face critical challenges in the context of policy learning, including temporal entanglement and an inability to generalise even in the presence of minor scene perturbations. These limitations hinder performance in tasks requiring temporal awareness and robustness to scene changes. This work identifies these shortcomings and proposes solutions to address them. First, we augment PVR features with temporal perception and a sense of task completion, effectively disentangling them in time. Second, we introduce a module that learns to selectively attend to task-relevant local features, enhancing robustness when evaluated on out-of-distribution scenes. Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements, particularly in PVRs trained with masking objectives, and validate the effectiveness of our enhancements in addressing PVR-specific limitations.

Abstract: As next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) networks continue to grow, the number of connected devices is rapidly increasing, along with their energy demands. This creates challenges for resource management and sustainability. Energy-efficient communication, particularly for power-limited IoT devices, is therefore a key research focus. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices and transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the global system energy efficiency of wireless LoRa networks by joint optimization of transmission power, spreading factor, bandwidth, and user association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa GW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm, significantly improves the global system energy efficiency and surpasses the popular MARL and other conventional schemes.

<title>Recursive Inference Scaling: A Winning Path to Scalable Inference in Language and Multimodal Systems</title>

Abstract: Inspired by recent findings on the fractal geometry of language, we introduce Recursive INference Scaling (RINS) as a complementary, plug-in recipe for scaling inference time in language and multimodal systems. RINS is a particular form of recursive depth that significantly outperforms +55 other variants, including the recent "repeat-all-over" (RAO) strategy in Mobile LLM (Liu et al., 2024) and latent recurrent thinking (Geiping et al., 2025). Unlike prior works, we carry out our comparisons on a compute-matched regime, and demonstrate that for a fixed model size and training compute budget, RINS substantially improves language modeling performance. It also generalizes beyond pure language tasks, delivering gains in multimodal systems, including a +2% improvement in 0-shot ImageNet accuracy for SigLIP-B/16. Additionally, by deriving data scaling laws, we show that RINS improves both the asymptotic performance limits and the scaling exponents. More importantly, with light-weight (linear) adapters (comprising <1% of model parameters) and stochastic dropout, RINS offers a no-regret strategy, meaning that RINS-enabled pretraining improves performance in language modeling even when recursive depth is not applied at inference time. This corresponds to improving performance on a training compute-, parameter-, and inference-matched regime, suggesting its potential as a viable component of LLM pretraining!

arXiv:2502.08033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.

Abstract: Code generation, symbolic math reasoning, and other tasks require LLMs to produce outputs that are both syntactically and semantically correct. Constrained LLM generation is a promising direction to enforce adherence to formal grammar, but prior works have empirically observed that strict enforcement of formal constraints often diminishes the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical explanation for why constraining LLM outputs to very restrictive grammars that only allow syntactically valid final answers reduces the reasoning capabilities of the model. Second, we demonstrate that by augmenting the output grammar with carefully designed additional rules, it is always possible to preserve the reasoning capabilities of the LLM while ensuring syntactic and semantic correctness in its outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose a reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, CRANE, which effectively balances the correctness of constrained generation with the flexibility of unconstrained generation. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs and benchmarks show that CRANE significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art constrained decoding strategies and standard unconstrained decoding, showing up to 10% points accuracy improvement over baselines on challenging symbolic reasoning benchmarks GSM-symbolic and FOLIO.

arXiv:2502.09203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to large intra-subject and inter-subject variabilities of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) usually need subject-specific calibration to tailor the decoding algorithm for each new subject, which is time-consuming and user-unfriendly, hindering their real-world applications. Transfer learning (TL) has been extensively used to expedite the calibration, by making use of EEG data from other subjects/sessions. An important consideration in TL for EEG-based BCIs is to reduce the data distribution discrepancies among different subjects/sessions, to avoid negative transfer. Euclidean alignment (EA) was proposed in 2020 to address this challenge. Numerous experiments from 13 different BCI paradigms demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency. This paper revisits EA, explaining its procedure and correct usage, introducing its applications and extensions, and pointing out potential new research directions. It should be very helpful to BCI researchers, especially those who are working on EEG signal decoding.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for text generation has led to widespread concerns about AI-generated content detection. However, an overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate twelve state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation (APT-Eval) dataset, which contains 14.7K samples refined at varying AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models. These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection methodologies.

<title>Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title>

Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding. It asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment. In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger. It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.

arXiv:2502.17579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voice data is increasingly being used in modern digital communications, yet there is still a lack of comprehensive tools for automated voice analysis and characterization. To this end, we developed the VANPY (Voice Analysis in Python) framework for automated pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification of voice data. The VANPY is an open-source end-to-end comprehensive framework that was developed for the purpose of speaker characterization from voice data. The framework is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy integration of new components and adaptation to various voice analysis applications. It currently incorporates over fifteen voice analysis components - including music/speech separation, voice activity detection, speaker embedding, vocal feature extraction, and various classification models.
  Four of the VANPY's components were developed in-house and integrated into the framework to extend its speaker characterization capabilities: gender classification, emotion classification, age regression, and height regression. The models demonstrate robust performance across various datasets, although not surpassing state-of-the-art performance.
  As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the framework's ability to extract speaker characteristics on a use-case challenge of analyzing character voices from the movie "Pulp Fiction." The results illustrate the framework's capability to extract multiple speaker characteristics, including gender, age, height, emotion type, and emotion intensity measured across three dimensions: arousal, dominance, and valence.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion in the scale of large language models (LLMs), enabling efficient distributed inference across multiple computing units has become increasingly critical. However, communication overheads from popular distributed inference techniques such as Tensor Parallelism pose a significant challenge to achieve scalability and low latency. Therefore, we introduce a novel optimization technique, Sync-Point Drop (SPD), to reduce communication overheads in tensor parallelism by selectively dropping synchronization on attention outputs. In detail, we first propose a block design that allows execution to proceed without communication through SPD. Second, we apply different SPD strategies to attention blocks based on their sensitivity to the model accuracy. The proposed methods effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks while minimizing accuracy degradation during LLM inference, offering a scalable solution for diverse distributed environments: SPD offered about 20% overall inference latency reduction with < 1% accuracy regression for LLaMA2-70B inference over 8 GPUs.

<title>A Systematic Literature Review on Safety of the Intended Functionality for Automated Driving Systems</title>

Abstract: In the automobile industry, ensuring the safety of automated vehicles equipped with the Automated Driving System (ADS) is becoming a significant focus due to the increasing development and deployment of automated driving. Automated driving depends on sensing both the external and internal environments of a vehicle, utilizing perception sensors and algorithms, and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems for situational awareness and response. ISO 21448 is the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) that aims to ensure that the ADS operate safely within their intended functionality. SOTIF focuses on preventing or mitigating potential hazards that may arise from the limitations or failures of the ADS, including hazards due to insufficiencies of specification, or performance insufficiencies, as well as foreseeable misuse of the intended functionality. However, the challenge lies in ensuring the safety of vehicles despite the limited availability of extensive and systematic literature on SOTIF. To address this challenge, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on SOTIF for the ADS is performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The objective is to methodically gather and analyze the existing literature on SOTIF. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) presenting a summary of the literature by synthesizing and organizing the collective findings, methodologies, and insights into distinct thematic groups, and (ii) summarizing and categorizing the acknowledged limitations based on data extracted from an SLR of 51 research papers published between 2018 and 2023. Furthermore, research gaps are determined, and future research directions are proposed.

Abstract: Effective trajectory stitching for long-horizon planning is a significant challenge in robotic decision-making. While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

<title>Better Estimation of the KL Divergence Between Language Models</title>

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between language models has many applications, e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), interpretability, and knowledge distillation. However, computing the exact KL divergence between two arbitrary language models is intractable. Thus, practitioners often resort to the use of sampling-based estimators. While it is easy to fashion a simple Monte Carlo (MC) estimator that provides an unbiased estimate of the KL divergence between language models, this estimator notoriously suffers from high variance, and can even result in a negative estimate of the KL divergence, a non-negative quantity. In this paper, we introduce a Rao--Blackwellized estimator that is also unbiased and provably has variance less than or equal to that of the standard Monte Carlo estimator. In an empirical study on sentiment-controlled fine-tuning, we show that our estimator provides more stable KL estimates and reduces variance substantially in practice. Additionally, we derive an analogous Rao--Blackwellized estimator of the gradient of the KL divergence, which leads to more stable training and produces models that more frequently appear on the Pareto frontier of reward vs. KL compared to the ones trained with the MC estimator of the gradient.

arXiv:2504.12279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a geometry-driven method for normalizing dysarthric speech by modeling time, frequency, and amplitude distortions as smooth, local Lie group transformations of spectrograms. Scalar fields generate these deformations via exponential maps, and a neural network is trained - using only synthetically warped healthy speech - to infer the fields and apply an approximate inverse at test time. We introduce a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking (SSB) potential that encourages the model to discover non-trivial field configurations. On real pathological speech, the system delivers consistent gains: up to 17 percentage-point WER reduction on challenging TORGO utterances and a 16 percent drop in WER variance, with no degradation on clean CommonVoice data. Character and phoneme error rates improve in parallel, confirming linguistic relevance. Our results demonstrate that geometrically structured warping provides consistent, zero-shot robustness gains for dysarthric ASR.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning aims to quickly identify solutions for new tasks with minimal or no additional interaction with the environment. Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) addresses this by combining a set of base policies to produce a new one that is at least as good -- though not necessarily optimal -- as any individual base policy. Optimality can be ensured, particularly in the linear-reward case, via techniques that compute a Convex Coverage Set (CCS). However, these are computationally expensive and do not scale to complex domains. The Option Keyboard (OK) improves upon GPI by producing policies that are at least as good -- and often better. It achieves this through a learned meta-policy that dynamically combines base policies. However, its performance critically depends on the choice of base policies. This raises a key question: is there an optimal set of base policies -- an optimal behavior basis -- that enables zero-shot identification of optimal solutions for any linear tasks? We solve this open problem by introducing a novel method that efficiently constructs such an optimal behavior basis. We show that it significantly reduces the number of base policies needed to ensure optimality in new tasks. We also prove that it is strictly more expressive than a CCS, enabling particular classes of non-linear tasks to be solved optimally. We empirically evaluate our technique in challenging domains and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, increasingly so as task complexity increases.

<div> Sparse Mixture of Experts, scalability, deep learning, routing fluctuations, model non-robustness

Summary:
In this study, the authors explore the limitations of Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) in deep learning models. They introduce the concept of probabilistic graphical models (PGM) to analyze the issue of routing fluctuations and non-robustness in SMoE. By addressing the independence in expert selection of tokens, the authors propose a new model called Similarity-Aware (S)MoE. This model considers token interactions during expert selection, leading to the development of the Attention-Aware (S)MoE which utilizes the attention matrix for guiding token routing. Theoretical analysis shows that similarity/attention-aware routing reduces entropy in expert selection, resulting in more stable token routing mechanisms. Empirical validation on various tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of these models, showing improvements in reducing routing fluctuations, enhancing accuracy, and increasing model robustness compared to baseline models. <div>
arXiv:2505.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a key to achieving unprecedented scalability in deep learning. By activating only a small subset of parameters per sample, SMoE achieves an exponential increase in parameter counts while maintaining a constant computational overhead. However, SMoE models are susceptible to routing fluctuations--changes in the routing of a given input to its target expert--at the late stage of model training, leading to model non-robustness. In this work, we unveil the limitation of SMoE through the perspective of the probabilistic graphical model (PGM). Through this PGM framework, we highlight the independence in the expert-selection of tokens, which exposes the model to routing fluctuation and non-robustness. Alleviating this independence, we propose the novel Similarity-Aware (S)MoE, which considers interactions between tokens during expert selection. We then derive a new PGM underlying an (S)MoE-Attention block, going beyond just a single (S)MoE layer. Leveraging the token similarities captured by the attention matrix, we propose the innovative Attention-Aware (S)MoE, which employs the attention matrix to guide the routing of tokens to appropriate experts in (S)MoE. We theoretically prove that Similarity/Attention-Aware routing help reduce the entropy of expert selection, resulting in more stable token routing mechanisms. We empirically validate our models on various tasks and domains, showing significant improvements in reducing routing fluctuations, enhancing accuracy, and increasing model robustness over the baseline MoE-Transformer with token routing via softmax gating.

Summary:  
The paper discusses the challenges faced in gradient-based bilevel optimization due to the computational expense of calculating second-order and mixed derivatives. It introduces a novel algorithm called MixFlow-MG that utilizes mixed-mode differentiation to improve the efficiency and scalability of computational graphs in meta-learning setups. By exploiting the specific structure of these problems, MixFlow-MG achieves over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements compared to standard implementations. The algorithm addresses the limitations of modern automatic differentiation libraries by enhancing the performance of gradient-of-a-gradient calculations, making it a valuable tool for various applications such as hyperparameter optimization, task adaptation, and algorithm discovery. <div>
arXiv:2505.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation process itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.

Summary: 
The article discusses the Explanatory View Hypothesis, which posits that neural networks inherently contain implicit explanations that can be extracted and understood. It introduces the concept of Explanatory Faithfulness, which assesses how well an explanation aligns with a model. The authors define Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing detailed, model-level, ontic, causal-mechanistic, and falsifiable explanations of neural networks. This definition allows for a clear distinction between MI and other interpretability paradigms while outlining the inherent limitations of MI. The article also introduces the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, suggesting that a positive outlook on the explanatory capabilities of neural networks is crucial for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability. <div>

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. We argue for the Explanatory View Hypothesis: that Mechanistic Interpretability research is a principled approach to understanding models because neural networks contain implicit explanations which can be extracted and understood. We hence show that Explanatory Faithfulness, an assessment of how well an explanation fits a model, is well-defined. We propose a definition of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing Model-level, Ontic, Causal-Mechanistic, and Falsifiable explanations of neural networks, allowing us to distinguish MI from other interpretability paradigms and detail MI's inherent limits. We formulate the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, a conjecture which we argue is a necessary precondition for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability.

arXiv:2505.00810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate a scalable methodology for harmonizing inconsistent units in large-scale clinical datasets, addressing a key barrier to data interoperability.
  Materials and Methods: We designed a novel unit harmonization system combining BM25, sentence embeddings, Bayesian optimization, and a bidirectional transformer based binary classifier for retrieving and matching laboratory test entries. The system was evaluated using the Optum Clinformatics Datamart dataset (7.5 billion entries). We implemented a multi-stage pipeline: filtering, identification, harmonization proposal generation, automated re-ranking, and manual validation. Performance was assessed using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and other standard information retrieval metrics.
  Results: Our hybrid retrieval approach combining BM25 and sentence embeddings (MRR: 0.8833) significantly outperformed both lexical-only (MRR: 0.7985) and embedding-only (MRR: 0.5277) approaches. The transformer-based reranker further improved performance (absolute MRR improvement: 0.10), bringing the final system MRR to 0.9833. The system achieved 83.39\% precision at rank 1 and 94.66\% recall at rank 5.
  Discussion: The hybrid architecture effectively leverages the complementary strengths of lexical and semantic approaches. The reranker addresses cases where initial retrieval components make errors due to complex semantic relationships in medical terminology.
  Conclusion: Our framework provides an efficient, scalable solution for unit harmonization in clinical datasets, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy. Once harmonized, data can be reused seamlessly in different analyses, ensuring consistency across healthcare systems and enabling more reliable multi-institutional studies and meta-analyses.

Summary:<br />
Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks can suffer from degraded generalization performance when trained with noisy supervision. Existing methods to address this issue often come with drawbacks such as high computational costs and the need for heavy hyperparameter tuning. In this study, a novel two-stage noisy learning framework is proposed to optimize at the instance level using a dynamically weighted loss function, eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning. A metric called wrong event is introduced to capture the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples for noise modeling without adding significant computational costs. The framework first builds a strong base model using wrong event information and then conducts noise-robust training on this model using a probabilistic approach. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming existing methods in performance while also significantly reducing computational time and improving model scalability.<br />

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that deep neural networks degrade in generalization performance under noisy supervision. Existing methods focus on isolating clean subsets or correcting noisy labels, facing limitations such as high computational costs, heavy hyperparameter tuning process, and coarse-grained optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage noisy learning framework that enables instance-level optimization through a dynamically weighted loss function, avoiding hyperparameter tuning. To obtain stable and accurate information about noise modeling, we introduce a simple yet effective metric, termed wrong event, which dynamically models the cleanliness and difficulty of individual samples while maintaining computational costs. Our framework first collects wrong event information and builds a strong base model. Then we perform noise-robust training on the base model, using a probabilistic model to handle the wrong event information of samples. Experiments on five synthetic and real-world LNL benchmarks demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance, achieves a nearly 75% reduction in computational time and improves model scalability.

Summary:
This paper presents a mathematical framework for causal nonlinear prediction in settings where observations are generated from a hidden Markov model (HMM). The framework is motivated by the decoder-only transformer architecture used for sequence prediction tasks. The proposed solution is based on an optimal control approach, redefining the prediction objective as an optimal control problem and deriving a fixed-point equation on the space of probability measures. The dual filter algorithm is introduced to solve the fixed-point equation, resembling the architecture of decoder-only transformers. The parallels between the algorithm and transformer models are discussed, highlighting prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the algorithm, using parameters commonly found in large-scale transformer models. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for causal nonlinear prediction in settings where observations are generated from an underlying hidden Markov model (HMM). Both the problem formulation and the proposed solution are motivated by the decoder-only transformer architecture, in which a finite sequence of observations (tokens) is mapped to the conditional probability of the next token. Our objective is not to construct a mathematical model of a transformer. Rather, our interest lies in deriving, from first principles, transformer-like architectures that solve the prediction problem for which the transformer is designed. The proposed framework is based on an original optimal control approach, where the prediction objective (MMSE) is reformulated as an optimal control problem. An analysis of the optimal control problem is presented leading to a fixed-point equation on the space of probability measures. To solve the fixed-point equation, we introduce the dual filter, an iterative algorithm that closely parallels the architecture of decoder-only transformers. These parallels are discussed in detail along with the relationship to prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers as transport on the space of probability measures. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm using parameter values used in researchscale transformer models.

Summary: 
Phase change is crucial in thermal management, but measuring temperature in complex flow regimes is challenging. This study introduces a data-driven approach using a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to infer temperature fields from phase contours in a pool boiling setup. By training the model with high-speed imaging data and simulations, temperature fields can be reconstructed with less than 6% error. Standard data augmentation techniques improve accuracy and physical realism of the predicted maps for both simulated and experimental data. The results demonstrate the potential of deep generative models to enhance understanding of multiphase heat transfer processes and interpret experimental measurements in complex two-phase systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change plays a critical role in thermal management systems, yet quantitative characterization of multiphase heat transfer remains limited by the challenges of measuring temperature fields in chaotic, rapidly evolving flow regimes. While computational methods offer spatiotemporal resolution in idealized cases, replicating complex experimental conditions remains prohibitively difficult. Here, we present a data-driven framework that leverages a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to infer temperature fields from geometric phase contours in a canonical pool boiling configuration where advanced data collection techniques are restricted. Using high-speed imaging data and simulation-informed training, our model demonstrates the ability to reconstruct temperature fields with errors below 6%. We further show that standard data augmentation strategies are effective in enhancing both accuracy and physical plausibility of the predicted maps across both simulation and experimental datasets when precise physical constraints are not applicable. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to bridge the gap between observable multiphase phenomena and underlying thermal transport, offering a powerful approach to augment and interpret experimental measurements in complex two-phase systems.

<div> intersectional fairness, regression tasks, protected attributes, fairness measure, ID

Summary:
In a new research paper, the focus is on addressing the gaps in measuring fairness in regression tasks, unlike existing work that mainly concentrates on classification tasks. The proposal introduces the concept of intersectional fairness in regression, considering combinations of all protected attributes, rather than just individual ones. Additionally, the paper argues that evaluating group errors without considering imbalanced domain preferences is inadequate. The concept of Intersectional Divergence (ID) is introduced as a fairness measure for regression tasks that describes fair model behavior across multiple protected attributes and takes into account the impact of predictions in relevant target ranges. The paper demonstrates how ID can be used as a loss function, called IDLoss, in optimization problems. Experimental results show that incorporating IDLoss into optimization can significantly enhance single-attribute and intersectional fairness of models while maintaining competitive predictive performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on fairness in machine learning has been mainly framed in the context of classification tasks, leaving critical gaps in regression. In this paper, we propose a seminal approach to measure intersectional fairness in regression tasks, going beyond the focus on single protected attributes from existing work to consider combinations of all protected attributes. Furthermore, we contend that it is insufficient to measure the average error of groups without regard for imbalanced domain preferences. To this end, we propose Intersectional Divergence (ID) as the first fairness measure for regression tasks that 1) describes fair model behavior across multiple protected attributes and 2) differentiates the impact of predictions in target ranges most relevant to users. We extend our proposal demonstrating how ID can be adapted into a loss function, IDLoss, and used in optimization problems. Through an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate how ID allows unique insights into model behavior and fairness, and how incorporating IDLoss into optimization can considerably improve single-attribute and intersectional model fairness while maintaining a competitive balance in predictive performance.

Abstract: Wildfires pose a critical environmental issue to ecosystems, economies, and public safety, particularly in Mediterranean regions such as Spain. Accurate predictive models rely on high-resolution spatio-temporal data to capture the complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. To address the lack of localised and fine-grained datasets in Spain, this work introduces IberFire, a spatio-temporal datacube at 1 km x 1 km x 1-day resolution covering mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands from December 2007 to December 2024. IberFire integrates 260 features across eight main categories: auxiliary features, fire history, geography, topography, meteorology, vegetation indices, human activity, and land cover. All features are derived from open-access sources, ensuring transparency and real-time applicability. The data processing pipeline was implemented entirely using open-source tools, and the codebase has been made publicly available. This work not only enhances spatio-temporal granularity and feature diversity compared to existing European datacubes but also provides a reproducible methodology for constructing similar datasets. IberFire supports advanced wildfire risk modelling through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, enables climate pattern analysis and informs strategic planning in fire prevention and land management.

<div> quantization, outlier suppression, index coding, Large Language Models, ICQuant

Summary:
ICQuant is a new framework designed to address the challenge of outlier suppression in weight quantization for Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging outlier statistics, ICQuant utilizes an efficient index coding scheme to improve quantization quality while minimizing bit overhead. Unlike existing techniques, ICQuant requires only a fraction of a bit to adjust quantization ranges, resulting in significant memory savings, especially in extreme compression scenarios. When applied to a 2-bit Llama3-70B model, ICQuant enhances zero-shot accuracy by up to 130% - 150% compared to other methods like QTIP and QuIP#. Furthermore, ICQuant achieves comparable performance to the top fine-tuned quantizer without the need for additional fine-tuning. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ICQuant in outlier-aware weight-only quantization for LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Effectively modeling time information and incorporating it into applications or models involving chronologically occurring events is crucial. Real-world scenarios often involve diverse and complex time patterns, which pose significant challenges for time encoding methods. While previous methods focus on capturing time patterns, many rely on specific inductive biases, such as using trigonometric functions to model periodicity. This narrow focus on single-pattern modeling makes them less effective in handling the diversity and complexities of real-world time patterns. In this paper, we investigate to improve the existing commonly used time encoding methods and introduce Learnable Transformation-based Generalized Time Encoding (LeTE). We propose using deep function learning techniques to parameterize non-linear transformations in time encoding, making them learnable and capable of modeling generalized time patterns, including diverse and complex temporal dynamics. By enabling learnable transformations, LeTE encompasses previous methods as specific cases and allows seamless integration into a wide range of tasks. Through extensive experiments across diverse domains, we demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of LeTE.

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to novel tasks and enhancing their overall capabilities often requires large, high-quality training datasets. Synthetic data, generated at scale, serves a valuable alternative when real-world data is scarce or difficult to obtain. However, ensuring the quality of synthetic datasets is challenging, as developers must manually inspect and refine numerous samples to identify errors and areas for improvement. This process is time-consuming and requires specialized tools. We introduce NeMo-Inspector, an open-source tool designed to simplify the analysis of synthetic datasets with integrated inference capabilities. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two real-world cases. Analysis and cleaning of the synthetically generated GSM-Plus dataset with NeMo-Inspector led to a significant decrease in low-quality samples from 46.99% to 19.51%. The tool also helped identify and correct generation errors in OpenMath models, improving accuracy by 1.92% on the MATH dataset and by 4.17% on the GSM8K dataset for a Meta-Llama-3-8B model fine-tuned on synthetic data generated from Nemotron-4-340B.

Summary:  
Control barrier functions are essential for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing synthesis algorithms face issues with dimensionality, prompting the use of deep learning. This paper introduces an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets, focusing on preventing the system from entering unsafe or unreliable states. The Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs) generated by the algorithm demonstrate improved safety and out-of-distribution avoidance without significant task performance degradation. <div>
arXiv:2505.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filters, particularly those based on control barrier functions, have gained increased interest as effective tools for safe control of dynamical systems. Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by proposing an algorithm for training control barrier functions from offline datasets. Our algorithm trains the filter to not only prevent the system from reaching unsafe states but also out-of-distribution ones, at which the filter would be unreliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety and out-of-distribution avoidance while minimally affecting task performance.

Summary: 
The article presents a Gaussian Process (GP)-based policy iteration framework for addressing forward and inverse problems in Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and mean field games. Policy iteration involves solving the value function under a fixed control policy and updating the policy based on the resulting value function. By leveraging the linear structure of GPs, each policy evaluation step has an explicit closed-form solution, eliminating the need for numerical optimization.

Abstract: We propose a Gaussian Process (GP)-based policy iteration framework for addressing both forward and inverse problems in Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations and mean field games (MFGs). Policy iteration is formulated as an alternating procedure between solving the value function under a fixed control policy and updating the policy based on the resulting value function. By exploiting the linear structure of GPs for function approximation, each policy evaluation step admits an explicit closed-form solution, eliminating the need for numerical optimization. To improve convergence, we incorporate the additive Schwarz acceleration as a preconditioning step following each policy update. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Schwarz acceleration in improving computational efficiency.

Summary:
Many offline-to-online algorithms struggle with fine-tuning learned policies, often experiencing performance degradation or slow learning. Traditional approaches focus on improving learning efficiency but result in initially decreased agent performance during fine-tuning. A new fine-tuning algorithm, based on the Jump Start algorithm, gradually increases exploration based on online performance estimates. This approach leads to faster fine-tuning and reduces performance degradation compared to existing algorithms. By incorporating online estimates of performance, the algorithm manages exploration more effectively, resulting in improved policy adaptation during the fine-tuning stage. This advancement addresses the challenges of fine-tuning learned networks online, offering a solution to the common problem of performance degradation during the initial fine-tuning phase. <div>
arXiv:2505.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning policies learned offline remains a major challenge in application domains. Monotonic performance improvement during \emph{fine-tuning} is often challenging, as agents typically experience performance degradation at the early fine-tuning stage. The community has identified multiple difficulties in fine-tuning a learned network online, however, the majority of progress has focused on improving learning efficiency during fine-tuning. In practice, this comes at a serious cost during fine-tuning: initially, agent performance degrades as the agent explores and effectively overrides the policy learned offline. We show across a range of settings, many offline-to-online algorithms exhibit either (1) performance degradation or (2) slow learning (sometimes effectively no improvement) during fine-tuning. We introduce a new fine-tuning algorithm, based on an algorithm called Jump Start, that gradually allows more exploration based on online estimates of performance. Empirically, this approach achieves fast fine-tuning and significantly reduces performance degradations compared with existing algorithms designed to do the same.

Summary:
The study examines how a one-layer transformer learns to solve regular language recognition tasks like even pairs and parity check. It analyzes the training dynamics under gradient descent. Even pairs can be solved directly by the transformer, but parity check requires the integration of Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer rapidly maps data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer stabilizes, while the linear layer grows logarithmically towards a max-margin hyperplane. The loss decreases at a rate of O(1/t) as the linear layer approaches correct separation of outputs. Experimental results confirm the theoretical findings. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.

<div> Transformer architecture, long sequences, self-attention computation, scalable models, memory mechanism 

Summary:
The Transformer architecture has been successful in various language processing and visual tasks but struggles with scaling to long sequences due to quadratic self-attention computation. To address this challenge, several methods break sequences into segments, limiting self-attention to local dependencies within each segment. However, these approaches introduce additional compute overhead. The Compact Recurrent Transformer (CRT) proposed in this study combines shallow Transformer models with recurrent neural networks to efficiently compress and manage long-range global information using a single memory vector. CRT achieves competitive results on language datasets like WordPTB and WikiText-103, using shorter segments and reduced computational complexity compared to full-length Transformers. It also demonstrates top performance on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset. This approach offers a promising solution for applications with limited compute resources like edge computing.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has shown significant success in many language processing and visual tasks. However, the method faces challenges in efficiently scaling to long sequences because the self-attention computation is quadratic with respect to the input length. To overcome this limitation, several approaches scale to longer sequences by breaking long sequences into a series of segments, restricting self-attention to local dependencies between tokens within each segment and using a memory mechanism to manage information flow between segments. However, these approached generally introduce additional compute overhead that restricts them from being used for applications where limited compute memory and power are of great concern (such as edge computing). We propose a novel and efficient Compact Recurrent Transformer (CRT), which combines shallow Transformer models that process short local segments with recurrent neural networks to compress and manage a single persistent memory vector that summarizes long-range global information between segments. We evaluate CRT on WordPTB and WikiText-103 for next-token-prediction tasks, as well as on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset for classification. CRT achieves comparable or superior prediction results to full-length Transformers in the language datasets while using significantly shorter segments (half or quarter size) and substantially reduced FLOPs. Our approach also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Toyota Smarthome video dataset.

<div> Algorithm, Anomaly, Root cause, Fix, Interventional estimates

Summary:<br />
The article presents a novel algorithm called In-Distribution Interventions (IDI) aimed at diagnosing the root cause of anomalies in complex interconnected systems. IDI predicts root cause nodes by considering nodes with anomalous values that, if restored to usual values, would prevent the anomaly. Unlike previous methods that rely on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) and counterfactual estimates, IDI uses interventional estimates obtained from the SCM at in-distribution inputs to overcome the unreliability of counterfactual estimates for rare anomalies. Theoretical analysis is provided to compare and bound the errors in assessing the fix condition using interventional and counterfactual estimates. Experimental results on synthetic and PetShop RCD benchmark datasets demonstrate that IDI outperforms nine existing state-of-the-art Root Cause Diagnosis (RCD) baselines by accurately and robustly identifying true root causes. The code for IDI is available on GitHub for further exploration and use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing the root cause of an anomaly in a complex interconnected system is a pressing problem in today's cloud services and industrial operations. We propose In-Distribution Interventions (IDI), a novel algorithm that predicts root cause as nodes that meet two criteria: 1) **Anomaly:** root cause nodes should take on anomalous values; 2) **Fix:** had the root cause nodes assumed usual values, the target node would not have been anomalous. Prior methods of assessing the fix condition rely on counterfactuals inferred from a Structural Causal Model (SCM) trained on historical data. But since anomalies are rare and fall outside the training distribution, the fitted SCMs yield unreliable counterfactual estimates. IDI overcomes this by relying on interventional estimates obtained by solely probing the fitted SCM at in-distribution inputs. We present a theoretical analysis comparing and bounding the errors in assessing the fix condition using interventional and counterfactual estimates. We then conduct experiments by systematically varying the SCM's complexity to demonstrate the cases where IDI's interventional approach outperforms the counterfactual approach and vice versa. Experiments on both synthetic and PetShop RCD benchmark datasets demonstrate that \our\ consistently identifies true root causes more accurately and robustly than nine existing state-of-the-art RCD baselines. Code is released at https://github.com/nlokeshiisc/IDI_release.

Summary:
The paper introduces a Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for detecting faulty bikes in bike-sharing systems. The model utilizes spatiotemporal features extracted from GPS data and trip records. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations through a self-supervised objective, and in the fine-tuning phase, it is adapted for binary classification. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Chengdu show that SSTransformer outperforms traditional methods, achieving high accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358).

Abstract: The rapid expansion of bike-sharing systems (BSS) has greatly improved urban "last-mile" connectivity, yet large-scale deployments face escalating operational challenges, particularly in detecting faulty bikes. Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex anomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance solutions for shared mobility.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQCNNs) represent a promising frontier in machine learning, leveraging the complementary strengths of both models. In this work, we propose the development of TunnElQNN, a non-sequential architecture composed of alternating classical and quantum layers. Within the classical component, we employ the Tunnelling Diode Activation Function (TDAF), inspired by the I-V characteristics of quantum tunnelling. We evaluate the performance of this hybrid model on a synthetic dataset of interleaving half-circle for multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of class overlap. The model is compared against a baseline hybrid architecture that uses the conventional ReLU activation function (ReLUQNN). Our results show that the TunnElQNN model consistently outperforms the ReLUQNN counterpart. Furthermore, we analyse the decision boundaries generated by TunnElQNN under different levels of class overlap and compare them to those produced by a neural network implementing TDAF within a fully classical architecture. These findings highlight the potential of integrating physics-inspired activation functions with quantum components to enhance the expressiveness and robustness of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning architectures.

Summary: 
StablePCA is introduced as a method for robust learning of latent representations in multi-source high-dimensional data. The nonconvexity of the fixed rank constraint in traditional PCA is addressed using the Fantope relaxation, transforming the problem into a convex minimax optimization. The Mirror Prox algorithm is utilized to solve the relaxed formulation, ensuring global convergence with a specified convergence rate. Practical criteria are provided to evaluate the solution's proximity to the original nonconvex formulation. Through numerical experiments, StablePCA is shown to accurately and efficiently extract robust low-dimensional representations across various finite-sample scenarios. This method facilitates the extraction of low-dimensional features that can effectively approximate original features across different sources, promoting the discovery of transferable knowledge, mitigating systematic biases, and enhancing fairness in data analysis. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: When synthesizing multisource high-dimensional data, a key objective is to extract low-dimensional feature representations that effectively approximate the original features across different sources. Such general feature extraction facilitates the discovery of transferable knowledge, mitigates systematic biases such as batch effects, and promotes fairness. In this paper, we propose Stable Principal Component Analysis (StablePCA), a novel method for group distributionally robust learning of latent representations from high-dimensional multi-source data. A primary challenge in generalizing PCA to the multi-source regime lies in the nonconvexity of the fixed rank constraint, rendering the minimax optimization nonconvex. To address this challenge, we employ the Fantope relaxation, reformulating the problem as a convex minimax optimization, with the objective defined as the maximum loss across sources. To solve the relaxed formulation, we devise an optimistic-gradient Mirror Prox algorithm with explicit closed-form updates. Theoretically, we establish the global convergence of the Mirror Prox algorithm, with the convergence rate provided from the optimization perspective. Furthermore, we offer practical criteria to assess how closely the solution approximates the original nonconvex formulation. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate StablePCA's high accuracy and efficiency in extracting robust low-dimensional representations across various finite-sample scenarios.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for system monitoring and risk identification, across various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, for most reconstruction-based approaches, detecting anomalies remains a challenge due to the complexity of sequential patterns in time series data. On the one hand, reconstruction-based techniques are susceptible to computational deviation stemming from anomalies, which can lead to impure representations of normal sequence patterns. On the other hand, they often focus on the time-domain dependencies of time series, while ignoring the alignment of frequency information beyond the time domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-augmented Convolutional Transformer (FreCT). FreCT utilizes patch operations to generate contrastive views and employs an improved Transformer architecture integrated with a convolution module to capture long-term dependencies while preserving local topology information. The introduced frequency analysis based on Fourier transformation could enhance the model's ability to capture crucial characteristics beyond the time domain. To protect the training quality from anomalies and improve the robustness, FreCT deploys stop-gradient Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and absolute error to optimize consistency information in both time and frequency domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreCT outperforms existing methods in identifying anomalies.

Abstract: Fraud detection is crucial in social service networks to maintain user trust and improve service network security. Existing spectral graph-based methods address this challenge by leveraging different graph filters to capture signals with different frequencies in service networks. However, most graph filter-based methods struggle with deriving clean and discriminative graph signals. On the one hand, they overlook the noise in the information propagation process, resulting in degradation of filtering ability. On the other hand, they fail to discriminate the frequency-specific characteristics of graph signals, leading to distortion of signals fusion. To address these issues, we develop a novel spectral graph network based on information bottleneck theory (SGNN-IB) for fraud detection in service networks. SGNN-IB splits the original graph into homophilic and heterophilic subgraphs to better capture the signals at different frequencies. For the first limitation, SGNN-IB applies information bottleneck theory to extract key characteristics of encoded representations. For the second limitation, SGNN-IB introduces prototype learning to implement signal fusion, preserving the frequency-specific characteristics of signals. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SGNN-IB outperforms state-of-the-art fraud detection methods.

Summary:
In the realm of neural network verification, formal verification techniques are crucial for ensuring quality and reliability. The state-of-the-art approach, Branch and Bound (BaB), has shown effectiveness but lacks efficiency due to its simplistic exploration strategy. To address this limitation, a novel verification method called ABONN has been introduced. ABONN utilizes an adaptive exploration approach inspired by Monte-Carlo tree search, prioritizing sub-problems with higher likelihoods of containing counterexamples. This strategy leads to significant speedups, with ABONN achieving up to 15.2 times faster verification on the MNIST dataset and 24.7 times faster on CIFAR-10 compared to baseline approaches. The study also delves into the impact of hyperparameters on ABONN's performance and highlights the efficacy of the adaptive tree exploration strategy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Formal verification is a rigorous approach that can provably ensure the quality of neural networks, and to date, Branch and Bound (BaB) is the state-of-the-art that performs verification by splitting the problem as needed and applying off-the-shelf verifiers to sub-problems for improved performance. However, existing BaB may not be efficient, due to its naive way of exploring the space of sub-problems that ignores the \emph{importance} of different sub-problems. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a notion of ``importance'' that reflects how likely a counterexample can be found with a sub-problem, and then we devise a novel verification approach, called ABONN, that explores the sub-problem space of BaB adaptively, in a Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) style. The exploration is guided by the ``importance'' of different sub-problems, so it favors the sub-problems that are more likely to find counterexamples. As soon as it finds a counterexample, it can immediately terminate; even though it cannot find, after visiting all the sub-problems, it can still manage to verify the problem. We evaluate ABONN with 552 verification problems from commonly-used datasets and neural network models, and compare it with the state-of-the-art verifiers as baseline approaches. Experimental evaluation shows that ABONN demonstrates speedups of up to $15.2\times$ on MNIST and $24.7\times$ on CIFAR-10. We further study the influences of hyperparameters to the performance of ABONN, and the effectiveness of our adaptive tree exploration.

Summary: The article introduces a new approach, Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (TSW) distance, which enhances topological structure capturing in integration domains. The method utilizes nonlinear projections, ensuring the injectivity of Radon Transform and metric well-definedness. Efficient metrics for Euclidean spaces and spheres are constructed through appropriate projections. Extensive numerical experiments validate the proposed metric's efficacy for Euclidean and spherical datasets. Applications in gradient flows, self-supervised learning, and generative models show significant improvements over previous Sliced Wasserstein and Tree-Sliced Wasserstein variants.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Tree-Sliced methods have recently emerged as an alternative to the traditional Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, replacing one-dimensional lines with tree-based metric spaces and incorporating a splitting mechanism for projecting measures. This approach enhances the ability to capture the topological structures of integration domains in Sliced Optimal Transport while maintaining low computational costs. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel nonlinear projectional framework for the Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (TSW) distance, substituting the linear projections in earlier versions with general projections, while ensuring the injectivity of the associated Radon Transform and preserving the well-definedness of the resulting metric. By designing appropriate projections, we construct efficient metrics for measures on both Euclidean spaces and spheres. Finally, we validate our proposed metric through extensive numerical experiments for Euclidean and spherical datasets. Applications include gradient flows, self-supervised learning, and generative models, where our methods demonstrate significant improvements over recent SW and TSW variants.

<div> minimax-MDP, sequential decision-making, predictive uncertainty, machine learning, robust online decision-making

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a framework for sequential decision-making in the presence of augmented predictions from machine learning algorithms. The decision-maker receives prediction intervals for unknown parameters that become more accurate over time. The proposed framework, minimax Markov Decision Process (minimax-MDP), involves an adversarially evolving environment state and an internal state controlled by the decision-maker. Future-imposed conditions are introduced to ensure feasibility and enable the design of robustly competitive policies. Three applications are discussed to illustrate the framework: multi-period inventory ordering with refining demand predictions, resource allocation with uncertain utility functions, and a multi-phase extension of the minimax-MDP for inventory problems with changing ordering costs. The results provide a tractable approach to robust online decision-making under predictive uncertainty.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We study a class of sequential decision-making problems with augmented predictions, potentially provided by a machine learning algorithm. In this setting, the decision-maker receives prediction intervals for unknown parameters that become progressively refined over time, and seeks decisions that are competitive with the hindsight optimal under all possible realizations of both parameters and predictions. We propose a minimax Markov Decision Process (minimax-MDP) framework, where the system state consists of an adversarially evolving environment state and an internal state controlled by the decision-maker. We introduce a set of future-imposed conditions that characterize the feasibility of minimax-MDPs and enable the design of efficient, often closed-form, robustly competitive policies. We illustrate the framework through three applications: multi-period inventory ordering with refining demand predictions, resource allocation with uncertain utility functions, and a multi-phase extension of the minimax-MDP applied to the inventory problem with time-varying ordering costs. Our results provide a tractable and versatile approach to robust online decision-making under predictive uncertainty.

<div> Keywords: deep neural network training, FOSI, DHO2, distributed design, memory optimization

Summary:
The article introduces a new hybrid order optimizer, FOSI, which combines gradient and curvature information to accelerate deep neural network (DNN) training. The distributed design, DHO$_2$, optimizes the calculation of curvature information and model update to reduce memory burden and speed up training. A novel strategy is implemented to parallelize these processes on multiple devices, leading to a linear reduction in memory burden and a significant speedup in training time compared to conventional optimizers. The distributed design achieves a memory burden reduction and a speedup ranging from 1.4x to 2.1x when compared to other distributed designs using conventional optimizers. This approach provides a promising solution for accelerating DNN training in resource-constrained settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling deep neural network (DNN) training to more devices can reduce time-to-solution. However, it is impractical for users with limited computing resources. FOSI, as a hybrid order optimizer, converges faster than conventional optimizers by taking advantage of both gradient information and curvature information when updating the DNN model. Therefore, it provides a new chance for accelerating DNN training in the resource-constrained setting. In this paper, we explore its distributed design, namely DHO$_2$, including distributed calculation of curvature information and model update with partial curvature information to accelerate DNN training with a low memory burden. To further reduce the training time, we design a novel strategy to parallelize the calculation of curvature information and the model update on different devices. Experimentally, our distributed design can achieve an approximate linear reduction of memory burden on each device with the increase of the device number. Meanwhile, it achieves $1.4\times\sim2.1\times$ speedup in the total training time compared with other distributed designs based on conventional first- and second-order optimizers.

<div> Keywords: DiGraph Neural Networks, Knowledge Distillation, Hierarchical Knowledge Tree, Mutual Information, (Di)graph datasets

Summary:
The article introduces EDEN (Entropy-driven Digraph Knowledge Distillation), a new paradigm for data-centric learning in directed graphs. EDEN utilizes hierarchical encoding theory to construct a Hierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT) based on directed structural measurements. It quantifies mutual information of node profiles to refine knowledge flow in the HKT, facilitating data-centric Knowledge Distillation (KD) supervision during model training. EDEN significantly improves predictive performance for DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs) by leveraging the correlations between directed edges and node profiles. The framework extends naturally to undirected scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art results across 14 (di)graph datasets and 4 downstream tasks. Overall, EDEN demonstrates superior performance, highlighting the importance of exploring data-centric approaches for enhancing model-centric neural networks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The directed graph (digraph), as a generalization of undirected graphs, exhibits superior representation capability in modeling complex topology systems and has garnered considerable attention in recent years. Despite the notable efforts made by existing DiGraph Neural Networks (DiGNNs) to leverage directed edges, they still fail to comprehensively delve into the abundant data knowledge concealed in the digraphs. This data-level limitation results in model-level sub-optimal predictive performance and underscores the necessity of further exploring the potential correlations between the directed edges (topology) and node profiles (feature and labels) from a data-centric perspective, thereby empowering model-centric neural networks with stronger encoding capabilities.
  In this paper, we propose \textbf{E}ntropy-driven \textbf{D}igraph knowl\textbf{E}dge distillatio\textbf{N} (EDEN), which can serve as a data-centric digraph learning paradigm or a model-agnostic hot-and-plug data-centric Knowledge Distillation (KD) module. The core idea is to achieve data-centric ML, guided by our proposed hierarchical encoding theory for structured data. Specifically, EDEN first utilizes directed structural measurements from a topology perspective to construct a coarse-grained Hierarchical Knowledge Tree (HKT). Subsequently, EDEN quantifies the mutual information of node profiles to refine knowledge flow in the HKT, enabling data-centric KD supervision within model training. As a general framework, EDEN can also naturally extend to undirected scenarios and demonstrate satisfactory performance. In our experiments, EDEN has been widely evaluated on 14 (di)graph datasets (homophily and heterophily) and across 4 downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that EDEN attains SOTA performance and exhibits strong improvement for prevalent (Di)GNNs.

Summary: 
Continual Test-time adaptation (CTTA) continuously adapts the deployed model on incoming data batches. However, existing CTTA approaches are often not feasible on edge devices due to high memory and energy consumption. To address this, a novel paradigm of on-demand TTA is introduced, triggering adaptation only when significant domain shift is detected. The OD-TTA framework incorporates lightweight domain shift detection, selection of an appropriate source model for adaptation, and a decoupled Batch Normalization update scheme for memory-efficient adaptation. Experimental results show that OD-TTA achieves comparable or better performance while significantly reducing energy and computation overhead, making Test-time adaptation a practical solution for edge devices.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Continual Test-time adaptation (CTTA) continuously adapts the deployed model on every incoming batch of data. While achieving optimal accuracy, existing CTTA approaches present poor real-world applicability on resource-constrained edge devices, due to the substantial memory overhead and energy consumption. In this work, we first introduce a novel paradigm -- on-demand TTA -- which triggers adaptation only when a significant domain shift is detected. Then, we present OD-TTA, an on-demand TTA framework for accurate and efficient adaptation on edge devices. OD-TTA comprises three innovative techniques: 1) a lightweight domain shift detection mechanism to activate TTA only when it is needed, drastically reducing the overall computation overhead, 2) a source domain selection module that chooses an appropriate source model for adaptation, ensuring high and robust accuracy, 3) a decoupled Batch Normalization (BN) update scheme to enable memory-efficient adaptation with small batch sizes. Extensive experiments show that OD-TTA achieves comparable and even better performance while reducing the energy and computation overhead remarkably, making TTA a practical reality.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel watermarking method for embedding ownership information into deep neural networks (DNNs) that is resistant to fine-tuning. The method involves proving that specific frequency components of a convolutional filter remain unchanged during the fine-tuning process when the input feature of a convolutional layer contains only low-frequency components. A revised Fourier transform is proposed to extract these frequency components from the convolutional filter, which are found to be invariant to weight scaling and permutations. A watermark module is designed to encode the ownership information into these specific frequency components. Initial experiments have shown promising results in terms of the method's effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: This paper proves a new watermarking method to embed the ownership information into a deep neural network (DNN), which is robust to fine-tuning. Specifically, we prove that when the input feature of a convolutional layer only contains low-frequency components, specific frequency components of the convolutional filter will not be changed by gradient descent during the fine-tuning process, where we propose a revised Fourier transform to extract frequency components from the convolutional filter. Additionally, we also prove that these frequency components are equivariant to weight scaling and weight permutations. In this way, we design a watermark module to encode the watermark information to specific frequency components in a convolutional filter. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the growing concern surrounding photorealistic images created by generative models due to their potential misuse in misinformation and fraud. Current detection methods often have limitations such as requiring access to model weights or extensive real image datasets. To address this issue, the authors introduce a novel black box detection framework that only requires API access. This framework utilizes a corrupt and recover strategy by masking part of an image to measure the model's ability to reconstruct it, indicating the likelihood that the image was generated by the model. For black-box models that do not support masked inputs, a cost-efficient surrogate model aligned with the target model distribution is incorporated for enhanced detection capability. The framework demonstrates strong performance, outperforming baseline methods by 4.31% in mean average precision across multiple diffusion model variant datasets. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic images created by generative models has sparked both excitement and concern, as these images are increasingly indistinguishable from real ones to the human eye. While offering new creative and commercial possibilities, the potential for misuse, such as in misinformation and fraud, highlights the need for effective detection methods. Current detection approaches often rely on access to model weights or require extensive collections of real image datasets, limiting their scalability and practical application in real world scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel black box detection framework that requires only API access, sidestepping the need for model weights or large auxiliary datasets. Our approach leverages a corrupt and recover strategy: by masking part of an image and assessing the model ability to reconstruct it, we measure the likelihood that the image was generated by the model itself. For black-box models that do not support masked image inputs, we incorporate a cost efficient surrogate model trained to align with the target model distribution, enhancing detection capability. Our framework demonstrates strong performance, outperforming baseline methods by 4.31% in mean average precision across eight diffusion model variant datasets.

Summary:
Stagnation in evolutionary algorithms can actually aid in the convergence of the entire population, challenging the common belief that stagnation hinders progress. The study suggests that convergence does not necessarily indicate optimality, not even local optimality. It is important to note that simply achieving convergence is not enough to ensure the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms. The paper presents several counterexamples to illustrate this point, emphasizing that a more nuanced understanding of stagnation and convergence is crucial for improving the performance of evolutionary computation methods. <div>

Abstract: In the evolutionary computation community, it is widely believed that stagnation impedes convergence in evolutionary algorithms, and that convergence inherently indicates optimality. However, this perspective is misleading. In this study, it is the first to highlight that the stagnation of an individual can actually facilitate the convergence of the entire population, and convergence does not necessarily imply optimality, not even local optimality. Convergence alone is insufficient to ensure the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms. Several counterexamples are provided to illustrate this argument.

Summary: 
Actor-critic methods, especially single-timescale algorithms, have shown impressive performance in various tasks, yet their theoretical understanding remains challenging. Existing studies often focus on rare variants, but this research delves into the classic single-sample single-timescale actor-critic on continuous state-action space, using the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem as a benchmark. The study demonstrates that the single-timescale actor-critic can achieve an epsilon-optimal solution with a sample complexity of epsilon to -2 for solving LQR on continuous state-action space. This finding sheds new light on the performance of single-timescale actor-critic algorithms, bridging the gap between theoretical analysis and practical applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actor-critic methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various challenging tasks. However, theoretical understandings of their performance remain elusive and challenging. Existing studies mostly focus on practically uncommon variants such as double-loop or two-timescale stepsize actor-critic algorithms for simplicity. These results certify local convergence on finite state- or action-space only. We push the boundary to investigate the classic single-sample single-timescale actor-critic on continuous (infinite) state-action space, where we employ the canonical linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem as a case study. We show that the popular single-timescale actor-critic can attain an epsilon-optimal solution with an order of epsilon to -2 sample complexity for solving LQR on the demanding continuous state-action space. Our work provides new insights into the performance of single-timescale actor-critic, which further bridges the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various domains. However, the substantial hardware resources required for their training present a significant barrier to efficiency and scalability. To mitigate this challenge, low-precision training techniques have been widely adopted, leading to notable advancements in training efficiency. Despite these gains, low-precision training involves several components$\unicode{x2013}$such as weights, activations, and gradients$\unicode{x2013}$each of which can be represented in different numerical formats. The resulting diversity has created a fragmented landscape in low-precision training research, making it difficult for researchers to gain a unified overview of the field. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing low-precision training methods. To systematically organize these approaches, we categorize them into three primary groups based on their underlying numerical formats, which is a key factor influencing hardware compatibility, computational efficiency, and ease of reference for readers. The categories are: (1) fixed-point and integer-based methods, (2) floating-point-based methods, and (3) customized format-based methods. Additionally, we discuss quantization-aware training approaches, which share key similarities with low-precision training during forward propagation. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to advance this field.

In this work, the authors provide an analysis of consistency models, a new alternative to traditional diffusion models, showing that they offer accelerated generation of high-quality samples in few steps. They demonstrate that a consistency model can achieve KL divergence of order $O(\varepsilon^2)$ with only $O\left(\log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)$ iterations using constant step size.

Theoretical analysis for estimation of consistency models concludes that accurate learning is possible with small discretization steps in smooth and non-smooth settings.

Abstract: Consistency models have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to traditional SDE based diffusion models, offering a significant acceleration in generation by producing high quality samples in very few steps. Despite their empirical success, a proper theoretic justification for their speed up is still lacking. In this work, we provide the analysis which bridges this gap, showing that given a consistency model which can map the input at a given time to arbitrary timestamps along the reverse trajectory, one can achieve KL divergence of order $ O(\varepsilon^2) $ using only $ O\left(\log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $ iterations with constant step size, where d is the data dimension. Additionally, under minimal assumptions on the data distribution an increasingly common setting in recent diffusion model analyses we show that a similar KL convergence guarantee can be obtained, with the number of steps scaling as $ O\left(d \log\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\right) $. Going further, we also provide a theoretical analysis for estimation of such consistency models, concluding that accurate learning is feasible using small discretization steps, both in smooth and non smooth settings. Notably, our results for the non smooth case yield best in class convergence rates compared to existing SDE or ODE based analyses under minimal assumptions.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have emerged as powerful tools for modeling the responses of complex nonlinear materials directly from experimental measurements. Among these methods, the data-driven constitutive models present advantages in physical interpretability and generalizability across different boundary conditions/domain settings. However, the well-posedness of these learned models is generally not guaranteed a priori, which makes the models prone to non-physical solutions in downstream simulation tasks. In this study, we introduce monotone peridynamic neural operator (MPNO), a novel data-driven nonlocal constitutive model learning approach based on neural operators. Our approach learns a nonlocal kernel together with a nonlinear constitutive relation, while ensuring solution uniqueness through a monotone gradient network. This architectural constraint on gradient induces convexity of the learnt energy density function, thereby guaranteeing solution uniqueness of MPNO in small deformation regimes. To validate our approach, we evaluate MPNO's performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. On synthetic datasets with manufactured kernel and constitutive relation, we show that the learnt model converges to the ground-truth as the measurement grid size decreases both theoretically and numerically. Additionally, our MPNO exhibits superior generalization capabilities than the conventional neural networks: it yields smaller displacement solution errors in down-stream tasks with new and unseen loadings. Finally, we showcase the practical utility of our approach through applications in learning a homogenized model from molecular dynamics data, highlighting its expressivity and robustness in real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
Knowledge distillation is a technique used to train compact student models using larger teacher models. Teacher models have richer feature representations, leading to potential fairness issues when labels correlate with specific input attributes. Early-Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) have been used to address this by enabling predictions at multiple intermediate layers. This paper proposes using Laplace approximation-based methods to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates to reweight challenging instances and improve group fairness. Laplace approximation is hypothesized to provide a more robust identification of difficult or ambiguous instances compared to margin-based approaches. The approach is benchmarked using a Bert-based model on the MultiNLI dataset. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a powerful tool for training compact student models using larger, pretrained teacher models, often requiring less data and computational resources. Teacher models typically possess more layers and thus exhibit richer feature representations compared to their student counterparts. Furthermore, student models tend to learn simpler, surface-level features in their early layers. This discrepancy can increase errors in groups where labels spuriously correlate with specific input attributes, leading to a decline in group fairness even when overall accuracy remains comparable to the teacher. To mitigate these challenges, Early-Exit Neural Networks (EENNs), which enable predictions at multiple intermediate layers, have been employed. Confidence margins derived from these early exits have been utilized to reweight both cross-entropy and distillation losses on a per-instance basis. In this paper, we propose that leveraging Laplace approximation-based methods to obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates can also effectively reweight challenging instances and improve group fairness. We hypothesize that Laplace approximation offers a more robust identification of difficult or ambiguous instances compared to margin-based approaches. To validate our claims, we benchmark our approach using a Bert-based model on the MultiNLI dataset.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Federated Foundation Models (FedFM) as a privacy-preserving approach to fine-tune models in federated learning. A key challenge is addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, especially in FedFM where large parameter scales and data heterogeneity pose challenges. The proposed FedOA method utilizes adapter-based fine-tuning for efficient parameter usage and personalized adapters with feature distance-based regularization to ensure OOD generalization for each client. The global model in FedFM inherently has OOD generalization capabilities, and FedOA enhances personalized model OOD generalization through regularization informed by the global model. The method is proven to converge under general non-convex settings. Empirical validation on NLP tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of FedOA. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As foundation models gain prominence, Federated Foundation Models (FedFM) have emerged as a privacy-preserving approach to collaboratively fine-tune models in federated learning (FL) frameworks using distributed datasets across clients. A key challenge for FedFM, given the versatile nature of foundation models, is addressing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where unseen tasks or clients may exhibit distribution shifts leading to suboptimal performance. Although numerous studies have explored OOD generalization in conventional FL, these methods are inadequate for FedFM due to the challenges posed by large parameter scales and increased data heterogeneity. To address these, we propose FedOA, which employs adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for efficacy and introduces personalized adapters with feature distance-based regularization to align distributions and guarantee OOD generalization for each client. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the conventional aggregated global model in FedFM inherently retains OOD generalization capabilities, and our proposed method enhances the personalized model's OOD generalization through regularization informed by the global model, with proven convergence under general non-convex settings. Empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on benchmark datasets across various NLP tasks.

<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a Stratonovich-based backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) formulation with stochastic Heun integration to address the performance gap observed in existing BSDE-based solvers compared to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The root cause of underperformance is attributed to a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme. The proposed Heun-based BSDE method eliminates this bias and outperforms EM-based variants, achieving competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. The integration scheme plays a crucial role in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an aspect that has not been adequately explored in the literature till now. This work sheds light on the significance of integration schemes for improving the computational efficiency and accuracy of BSDE-based deep learning methods in solving high-dimensional PDEs, particularly in stochastic optimal control applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, existing BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to short-horizon self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step sizes or longer self-consistency horizons. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.

This study introduces a complex water resource management case study based on the Nile river basin, modeled as a MORL environment. Existing MORL algorithms were tested on this task, revealing that specialized water management methods outperformed state-of-the-art MORL approaches.

Abstract: Many real-world problems (e.g., resource management, autonomous driving, drug discovery) require optimizing multiple, conflicting objectives. Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends classic reinforcement learning to handle multiple objectives simultaneously, yielding a set of policies that capture various trade-offs. However, the MORL field lacks complex, realistic environments and benchmarks. We introduce a water resource (Nile river basin) management case study and model it as a MORL environment. We then benchmark existing MORL algorithms on this task. Our results show that specialized water management methods outperform state-of-the-art MORL approaches, underscoring the scalability challenges MORL algorithms face in real-world scenarios.

Summary:  
Pipeline Parallelism (PP) enables training large neural networks on interconnected devices by splitting the model. Asynchronous optimization in PP offers 100% pipeline utilization but faces challenges due to stale gradients. A variant of Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) is introduced to address this issue by modifying the look-ahead step in NAG. The theoretical proof shows convergence at a sublinear rate with fixed delays in gradients. Experiments on large-scale language modeling tasks with up to 1B parameters using decoder-only architectures demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms existing asynchronous methods, even surpassing synchronous baselines. <div>

Abstract: Pipeline Parallelism (PP) enables large neural network training on small, interconnected devices by splitting the model into multiple stages. To maximize pipeline utilization, asynchronous optimization is appealing as it offers 100% pipeline utilization by construction. However, it is inherently challenging as the weights and gradients are no longer synchronized, leading to stale (or delayed) gradients. To alleviate this, we introduce a variant of Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) for asynchronous optimization in PP. Specifically, we modify the look-ahead step in NAG to effectively address the staleness in gradients. We theoretically prove that our approach converges at a sublinear rate in the presence of fixed delay in gradients. Our experiments on large-scale language modelling tasks using decoder-only architectures with up to 1B parameters, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing asynchronous methods, even surpassing the synchronous baseline.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The Competitive/Collaborative Fusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE) is a novel Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling technique addressing uncertainty in learning problems with multiple patterns. It blends predictions from simple sub-models to achieve high expressiveness and local interpretability. Unlike classical Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), CoCoAFusE considers the fusion of experts' distributions, leading to tighter credible bounds on the response variable, thus avoiding multimodality artifacts. This approach enhances model flexibility and expressiveness, demonstrated through numerical and real-data examples. CoCoAFusE showcases efficacy in tackling complex regression problems with a focus on uncertainty, contributing to advances in model interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification. <div>
arXiv:2505.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many learning problems involve multiple patterns and varying degrees of uncertainty dependent on the covariates. Advances in Deep Learning (DL) have addressed these issues by learning highly nonlinear input-output dependencies. However, model interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have often straggled behind. In this context, we introduce the Competitive/Collaborative Fusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE), a novel, Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling technique. CoCoAFusE builds on the very philosophy behind Mixtures of Experts (MoEs), blending predictions from several simple sub-models (or "experts") to achieve high levels of expressiveness while retaining a substantial degree of local interpretability. Our formulation extends that of a classical Mixture of Experts by contemplating the fusion of the experts' distributions in addition to their more usual mixing (i.e., superimposition). Through this additional feature, CoCoAFusE better accommodates different scenarios for the intermediate behavior between generating mechanisms, resulting in tighter credible bounds on the response variable. Indeed, only resorting to mixing, as in classical MoEs, may lead to multimodality artifacts, especially over smooth transitions. Instead, CoCoAFusE can avoid these artifacts even under the same structure and priors for the experts, leading to greater expressiveness and flexibility in modeling. This new approach is showcased extensively on a suite of motivating numerical examples and a collection of real-data ones, demonstrating its efficacy in tackling complex regression problems where uncertainty is a key quantity of interest.

Abstract: With the advent of score-matching techniques for model training and Langevin dynamics for sample generation, energy-based models (EBMs) have gained renewed interest as generative models. Recent EBMs usually use neural networks to define their energy functions. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid approach that combines an EBM with an exponential family model to incorporate inductive bias into data modeling. Specifically, we augment the energy term with a parameter-free statistic function to help the model capture key data statistics. Like an exponential family model, the hybrid model aims to align the distribution statistics with data statistics during model training, even when it only approximately maximizes the data likelihood. This property enables us to impose constraints on the hybrid model. Our empirical study validates the hybrid model's ability to match statistics. Furthermore, experimental results show that data fitting and generation improve when suitable informative statistics are incorporated into the hybrid model.

The article introduces a new framework called Justice that integrates Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) with Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL) to address the limitations of traditional IAMs in capturing trade-offs among economic growth, temperature goals, and climate justice.

The framework identifies equitable Pareto-optimal policies, facilitating deliberative decision-making by presenting policymakers with the inherent trade-offs in climate and economic policy. This new approach aims to improve the accuracy and fairness of policy recommendations related to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing climate change requires coordinated policy efforts of nations worldwide. These efforts are informed by scientific reports, which rely in part on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), prominent tools used to assess the economic impacts of climate policies. However, traditional IAMs optimize policies based on a single objective, limiting their ability to capture the trade-offs among economic growth, temperature goals, and climate justice. As a result, policy recommendations have been criticized for perpetuating inequalities, fueling disagreements during policy negotiations. We introduce Justice, the first framework integrating IAM with Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MOMARL). By incorporating multiple objectives, Justice generates policy recommendations that shed light on equity while balancing climate and economic goals. Further, using multiple agents can provide a realistic representation of the interactions among the diverse policy actors. We identify equitable Pareto-optimal policies using our framework, which facilitates deliberative decision-making by presenting policymakers with the inherent trade-offs in climate and economic policy.

Summary:
The paper addresses the challenge of deploying machine learning models in the presence of adversarial actions by proposing a versatile framework for evaluating model robustness. Initially focusing on Support Vector Regression (SVR), the approach can be extended to various learning techniques based on relaxed optimization. The framework allows for the assessment of model vulnerability without the need for additional test data and operates in a distribution-free setup. These results provide a tool to enhance trust in the model's applicability and aid in decision-making among competing alternatives. Additionally, the findings offer insights for advancing results within the out-of-distribution framework. <div>
arXiv:2505.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning models capable of providing reliable predictions in the face of adversarial actions has become a central focus of the machine learning community in recent years. This challenge arises from observing that data encountered at deployment time often deviate from the conditions under which the model was trained. In this paper, we address deployment-time adversarial actions and propose a versatile, well-principled framework to evaluate the model's robustness against attacks of diverse types and intensities. While we initially focus on Support Vector Regression (SVR), the proposed approach extends naturally to the broad domain of learning via relaxed optimization techniques. Our results enable an assessment of the model vulnerability without requiring additional test data and operate in a distribution-free setup. These results not only provide a tool to enhance trust in the model's applicability but also aid in selecting among competing alternatives. Later in the paper, we show that our findings also offer useful insights for establishing new results within the out-of-distribution framework.

Summary: 
This study introduces the Consensus of Dependent Experts (CoDE) method for aggregating single-modality distributions in multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs). Unlike current methods, CoDE considers the dependence between modalities, leading to a more accurate estimation of the joint likelihood of multimodal data. The CoDE-VAE model shows improved performance in balancing generative coherence and quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. It also minimizes the generative quality gap with increasing modalities, approaching the quality of unimodal VAEs. Additionally, the classification accuracy of CoDE-VAE is comparable to state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models. This novel approach offers promise for more efficient and effective multimodal learning with VAEs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning with variational autoencoders (VAEs) requires estimating joint distributions to evaluate the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Current methods, the product and mixture of experts, aggregate single-modality distributions assuming independence for simplicity, which is an overoptimistic assumption. This research introduces a novel methodology for aggregating single-modality distributions by exploiting the principle of consensus of dependent experts (CoDE), which circumvents the aforementioned assumption. Utilizing the CoDE method, we propose a novel ELBO that approximates the joint likelihood of the multimodal data by learning the contribution of each subset of modalities. The resulting CoDE-VAE model demonstrates better performance in terms of balancing the trade-off between generative coherence and generative quality, as well as generating more precise log-likelihood estimations. CoDE-VAE further minimizes the generative quality gap as the number of modalities increases. In certain cases, it reaches a generative quality similar to that of unimodal VAEs, which is a desirable property that is lacking in most current methods. Finally, the classification accuracy achieved by CoDE-VAE is comparable to that of state-of-the-art multimodal VAE models.

It incorporates advanced cross-modality alignment techniques to effectively combine textual and numerical data for enhanced comprehension. The model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on fifteen datasets, demonstrating the benefits of leveraging textual information in time series analysis.

arXiv:2505.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing single-modal time series models rely solely on numerical series, which suffer from the limitations imposed by insufficient information. Recent studies have revealed that multimodal models can address the core issue by integrating textual information. However, these models focus on either historical or future textual information, overlooking the unique contributions each plays in time series forecasting. Besides, these models fail to grasp the intricate relationships between textual and time series data, constrained by their moderate capacity for multimodal comprehension. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dual-Forecaster, a pioneering multimodal time series model that combines both descriptively historical textual information and predictive textual insights, leveraging advanced multimodal comprehension capability empowered by three well-designed cross-modality alignment techniques. Our comprehensive evaluations on fifteen multimodal time series datasets demonstrate that Dual-Forecaster is a distinctly effective multimodal time series model that outperforms or is comparable to other state-of-the-art models, highlighting the superiority of integrating textual information for time series forecasting. This work opens new avenues in the integration of textual information with numerical time series data for multimodal time series analysis.

arXiv:2505.01156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the growing computational challenges of power grid simulations, particularly with the increasing integration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar. As grid operators must analyze significantly more scenarios in near real-time to prevent failures and ensure stability, traditional physical-based simulations become computationally impractical. To tackle this, a competition was organized to develop AI-driven methods that accelerate power flow simulations by at least an order of magnitude while maintaining operational reliability. This competition utilized a regional-scale grid model with a 30\% renewable energy mix, mirroring the anticipated near-future composition of the French power grid. A key contribution of this work is through the use of LIPS (Learning Industrial Physical Systems), a benchmarking framework that evaluates solutions based on four critical dimensions: machine learning performance, physical compliance, industrial readiness, and generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Machine Learning for Physical Simulation (ML4PhySim) competition, detailing the benchmark suite, analyzing top-performing solutions that outperformed traditional simulation methods, and sharing key organizational insights and best practices for running large-scale AI competitions. Given the promising results achieved, the study aims to inspire further research into more efficient, scalable, and sustainable power network simulation methodologies.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces TActiLE, a novel Active Learning (AL) algorithm designed for the context of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) on wearable devices, specifically smart glasses. The algorithm aims to minimize the labeling effort by selecting a small subset of unlabeled data from on-device sensor streams for the user to label and add to the training set. This addresses the challenge of scarce labeled data collected on-device.

Abstract: Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms have seen extensive use in recent years, enabling wearable devices to be not only connected but also genuinely intelligent by running machine learning (ML) computations directly on-device. Among such devices, smart glasses have particularly benefited from TinyML advancements. TinyML facilitates the on-device execution of the inference phase of ML algorithms on embedded and wearable devices, and more recently, it has expanded into On-device Learning (ODL), which allows both inference and learning phases to occur directly on the device. The application of ODL techniques to wearable devices is particularly compelling, as it enables the development of more personalized models that adapt based on the data of the user. However, one of the major challenges of ODL algorithms is the scarcity of labeled data collected on-device. In smart wearable contexts, requiring users to manually label large amounts of data is often impractical and could lead to user disengagement with the technology. To address this issue, this paper explores the application of Active Learning (AL) techniques, i.e., techniques that aim at minimizing the labeling effort, by actively selecting from a large quantity of unlabeled data only a small subset to be labeled and added to the training set of the algorithm. In particular, we propose TActiLE, a novel AL algorithm that selects from the stream of on-device sensor data the ones that would help the ML algorithm improve the most once coupled with labels provided by the user. TActiLE is the first Active Learning technique specifically designed for the TinyML context. We evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency through experiments on multiple image classification datasets. The results demonstrate its suitability for tiny and wearable devices.

Abstract: Accurate time series forecasting is essential in many real-time applications that demand both high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. This study provides an empirical comparison between a Polynomial Classifier and a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) across four real-world time series datasets (weather conditions, gold prices, crude oil prices, and beer production volumes) that cover both seasonal and nonseasonal patterns. Model performance is evaluated by forecasting accuracy (using Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Coefficient of Variation of Root Mean Squared Error) and computational time to assess each model's viability for real time forecasting. The results show that the PC yields more accurate and faster forecasts for non seasonal series, whereas the RBFNN performs better on series with pronounced seasonal patterns. From an interpretability standpoint, the polynomial model offers a simpler, more transparent structure (in contrast to the black box nature of neural network), which is advantageous for understanding and trust in real time decision making. The performance differences between PC and RBFNN are statistically significant, as confirmed by paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. These findings provide practical guidance for model selection in time series forecasting, indicating that PC may be preferable for quick, interpretable forecasts in non-seasonal contexts, whereas RBFNN is superior for capturing complex seasonal behaviors

Abstract: The development of model ensemble attacks has significantly improved the transferability of adversarial examples, but this progress also poses severe threats to the security of deep neural networks. Existing methods, however, face two critical challenges: insufficient capture of shared gradient directions across models and a lack of adaptive weight allocation mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose a novel method Harmonized Ensemble for Adversarial Transferability (HEAT), which introduces domain generalization into adversarial example generation for the first time. HEAT consists of two key modules: Consensus Gradient Direction Synthesizer, which uses Singular Value Decomposition to synthesize shared gradient directions; and Dual-Harmony Weight Orchestrator which dynamically balances intra-domain coherence, stabilizing gradients within individual models, and inter-domain diversity, enhancing transferability across models. Experimental results demonstrate that HEAT significantly outperforms existing methods across various datasets and settings, offering a new perspective and direction for adversarial attack research.

Abstract: A flow matching model learns a time-dependent vector field $v_t(x)$ that generates a probability path $\{ p_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ that interpolates between a well-known noise distribution ($p_0$) and the data distribution ($p_1$). It can be distilled into a \emph{two-timed flow model} (TTFM) $\phi_{s,x}(t)$ that can transform a sample belonging to the distribution at an initial time $s$ to another belonging to the distribution at a terminal time $t$ in one function evaluation. We present a new loss function for TTFM distillation called the \emph{initial/terminal velocity matching} (ITVM) loss that extends the Lagrangian Flow Map Distillation (LFMD) loss proposed by Boffi et al. by adding redundant terms to match the initial velocities at time $s$, removing the derivative from the terminal velocity term at time $t$, and using a version of the model under training, stabilized by exponential moving averaging (EMA), to compute the target terminal average velocity. Preliminary experiments show that our loss leads to better few-step generation performance on multiple types of datasets and model architectures over baselines.

Abstract: To improve crop forecasting and provide farmers with actionable data-driven insights, we propose a novel approach integrating IoT, machine learning, and blockchain technologies. Using IoT, real-time data from sensor networks continuously monitor environmental conditions and soil nutrient levels, significantly improving our understanding of crop growth dynamics. Our study demonstrates the exceptional accuracy of the Random Forest model, achieving a 99.45\% accuracy rate in predicting optimal crop types and yields, thereby offering precise crop projections and customized recommendations. To ensure the security and integrity of the sensor data used for these forecasts, we integrate the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a robust and secure platform. This ensures that the forecasted data remain tamper-proof and reliable. Stakeholders can access real-time and historical crop projections through an intuitive online interface, enhancing transparency and facilitating informed decision-making. By presenting multiple predicted crop scenarios, our system enables farmers to optimize production strategies effectively. This integrated approach promises significant advances in precision agriculture, making crop forecasting more accurate, secure, and user-friendly.

Abstract: Medical audio signals, such as heart and lung sounds, play a crucial role in clinical diagnosis. However, analyzing these signals remains challenging: traditional methods rely on handcrafted features or supervised deep learning models that demand extensive labeled datasets, limiting their scalability and applicability. To address these issues, we propose CaReAQA, an audio-language model that integrates a foundation audio model with the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling clinically relevant, open-ended diagnostic responses. Alongside CaReAQA, we introduce CaReSound, a benchmark dataset of annotated medical audio recordings enriched with metadata and paired question-answer examples, intended to drive progress in diagnostic reasoning research. Evaluation results show that CaReAQA achieves 86.2% accuracy on open-ended diagnostic reasoning tasks, outperforming baseline models. It also generalizes well to closed-ended classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy of 56.9% on unseen datasets. Our findings show how audio-language integration and reasoning advances medical diagnostics, enabling efficient AI systems for clinical decision support.

<title>Quantitative Attractor Analysis of High-Capacity Kernel Logistic Regression Hopfield Networks</title>

Abstract: Traditional Hopfield networks, using Hebbian learning, face severe storage capacity limits ($\approx 0.14$ P/N) and spurious attractors. Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) offers a non-linear approach, mapping patterns to high-dimensional feature spaces for improved separability. Our previous work showed KLR dramatically improves capacity and noise robustness over conventional methods. This paper quantitatively analyzes the attractor structures in KLR-trained networks via extensive simulations. We evaluated recall from diverse initial states across wide storage loads (up to 4.0 P/N) and noise levels. We quantified convergence rates and speed. Our analysis confirms KLR's superior performance: high capacity (up to 4.0 P/N) and robustness. The attractor landscape is remarkably "clean," with near-zero spurious fixed points. Recall failures under high load/noise are primarily due to convergence to other learned patterns, not spurious ones. Dynamics are exceptionally fast (typically 1-2 steps for high-similarity states). This characterization reveals how KLR reshapes dynamics for high-capacity associative memory, highlighting its effectiveness and contributing to AM understanding.

<title>Enhancing Obsolescence Forecasting with Deep Generative Data Augmentation: A Semi-Supervised Framework for Low-Data Industrial Applications</title>

arXiv:2505.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of electronic component obsolescence is particularly critical in systems with long life cycles. Various obsolescence management methods are employed to mitigate its impact, with obsolescence forecasting being a highly sought-after and prominent approach. As a result, numerous machine learning-based forecasting methods have been proposed. However, machine learning models require a substantial amount of relevant data to achieve high precision, which is lacking in the current obsolescence landscape in some situations. This work introduces a novel framework for obsolescence forecasting based on deep learning. The proposed framework solves the lack of available data through deep generative modeling, where new obsolescence cases are generated and used to augment the training dataset. The augmented dataset is then used to train a classical machine learning-based obsolescence forecasting model. To train classical forecasting models using augmented datasets, existing classical supervised-learning classifiers are adapted for semi-supervised learning within this framework. The proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmarking datasets.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting and swift inference provision are essential for intelligent transportation systems. However, the present Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based approaches cannot extract and fuse multi-granular spatiotemporal features across various spatial and temporal scales sufficiently, proven to yield less accurate forecasts. Besides, additional feature extraction branches introduced in prior studies critically increased model complexity and extended inference time, making it challenging to provide fast inference for traffic forecasting. In this paper, we propose MultiGran-STGCNFog, an efficient fog distributed inference system with a novel traffic forecasting model that employs multi-granular spatiotemporal feature fusion on generated dynamic traffic graphs to fully capture interdependent traffic dynamics. The proposed scheduling algorithm GA-DPHDS, optimizing layer execution order and layer-device scheduling scheme simultaneously, contributes to considerable inference throughput improvement by leveraging heterogeneous fog devices in a pipelined manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over selected baselines.

Abstract: While data-driven methods such as neural operator have achieved great success in solving differential equations (DEs), they suffer from domain shift problems caused by different learning environments (with data bias or equation changes), which can be alleviated by transfer learning (TL). However, existing TL methods adopted in DEs problems lack either generalizability in general DEs problems or physics preservation during training. In this work, we focus on a general transfer learning method that adaptively correct the domain shift and preserve physical information. Mathematically, we characterize the data domain as product distribution and the essential problems as distribution bias and operator bias. A Physics-preserved Optimal Tensor Transport (POTT) method that simultaneously admits generalizability to common DEs and physics preservation of specific problem is proposed to adapt the data-driven model to target domain utilizing the push-forward distribution induced by the POTT map. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance, generalizability and physics preservation of the proposed POTT method.

<title>2DXformer: Dual Transformers for Wind Power Forecasting with Dual Exogenous Variables</title>

Abstract: Accurate wind power forecasting can help formulate scientific dispatch plans, which is of great significance for maintaining the safety, stability, and efficient operation of the power system. In recent years, wind power forecasting methods based on deep learning have focused on extracting the spatiotemporal correlations among data, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy. However, they exhibit two limitations. First, there is a lack of modeling for the inter-variable relationships, which limits the accuracy of the forecasts. Second, by treating endogenous and exogenous variables equally, it leads to unnecessary interactions between the endogenous and exogenous variables, increasing the complexity of the model. In this paper, we propose the 2DXformer, which, building upon the previous work's focus on spatiotemporal correlations, addresses the aforementioned two limitations. Specifically, we classify the inputs of the model into three types: exogenous static variables, exogenous dynamic variables, and endogenous variables. First, we embed these variables as variable tokens in a channel-independent manner. Then, we use the attention mechanism to capture the correlations among exogenous variables. Finally, we employ a multi-layer perceptron with residual connections to model the impact of exogenous variables on endogenous variables. Experimental results on two real-world large-scale datasets indicate that our proposed 2DXformer can further improve the performance of wind power forecasting. The code is available in this repository: \href{https://github.com/jseaj/2DXformer}{https://github.com/jseaj/2DXformer}.

<title>Integration of Multi-Mode Preference into Home Energy Management System Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.01332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Parallel data collection has redefined Reinforcement Learning (RL), unlocking unprecedented efficiency and powering breakthroughs in large-scale real-world applications. In this paradigm, $N$ identical agents operate in $N$ replicas of an environment simulator, accelerating data collection by a factor of $N$. A critical question arises: \textit{Does specializing the policies of the parallel agents hold the key to surpass the $N$ factor acceleration?} In this paper, we introduce a novel learning framework that maximizes the entropy of collected data in a parallel setting. Our approach carefully balances the entropy of individual agents with inter-agent diversity, effectively minimizing redundancies. The latter idea is implemented with a centralized policy gradient method, which shows promise when evaluated empirically against systems of identical agents, as well as synergy with batch RL techniques that can exploit data diversity. Finally, we provide an original concentration analysis that shows faster rates for specialized parallel sampling distributions, which supports our methodology and may be of independent interest.

Abstract: We consider binary classification restricted to a class of continuous piecewise linear functions whose decision boundaries are (possibly nonconvex) starshaped polyhedral sets, supported on a fixed polyhedral simplicial fan. We investigate the expressivity of these function classes and describe the combinatorial and geometric structure of the loss landscape, most prominently the sublevel sets, for two loss-functions: the 0/1-loss (discrete loss) and an exponential loss function. In particular, we give explicit bounds on the VC dimension of this model, and concretely describe the sublevel sets of the discrete loss as chambers in a hyperplane arrangement. For the exponential loss, we give sufficient conditions for the optimum to be unique, and describe the geometry of the optimum when varying the rate parameter of the underlying exponential probability distribution.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.01348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning to stabilize (LTS) a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Policy gradient (PG) methods for control assume access to an initial stabilizing policy. However, designing such a policy for an unknown system is one of the most fundamental problems in control, and it may be as hard as learning the optimal policy itself. Existing work on the LTS problem requires large data as it scales quadratically with the ambient dimension. We propose a two-phase approach that first learns the left unstable subspace of the system and then solves a series of discounted linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems on the learned unstable subspace, targeting to stabilize only the system's unstable dynamics and reduce the effective dimension of the control space. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for both phases and demonstrate that operating on the unstable subspace reduces sample complexity. In particular, when the number of unstable modes is much smaller than the state dimension, our analysis reveals that LTS on the unstable subspace substantially speeds up the stabilization process. Numerical experiments are provided to support this sample complexity reduction achieved by our approach.

Abstract: Temporal Difference (TD) learning is a foundational algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL). For nearly forty years, TD learning has served as a workhorse for applied RL as well as a building block for more complex and specialized algorithms. However, despite its widespread use, it is not without drawbacks, the most prominent being its sensitivity to step size. A poor choice of step size can dramatically inflate the error of value estimates and slow convergence. Consequently, in practice, researchers must use trial and error in order to identify a suitable step size -- a process that can be tedious and time consuming. As an alternative, we propose implicit TD algorithms that reformulate TD updates into fixed-point equations. These updates are more stable and less sensitive to step size without sacrificing computational efficiency. Moreover, our theoretical analysis establishes asymptotic convergence guarantees and finite-time error bounds. Our results demonstrate their robustness and practicality for modern RL tasks, establishing implicit TD as a versatile tool for policy evaluation and value approximation.

Abstract: Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to understand neural networks through causal explanations. Though MI has many explanation-generating methods, progress has been limited by the lack of a universal approach to evaluating explanations. Here we analyse the fundamental question "What makes a good explanation?" We introduce a pluralist Explanatory Virtues Framework drawing on four perspectives from the Philosophy of Science - the Bayesian, Kuhnian, Deutschian, and Nomological - to systematically evaluate and improve explanations in MI. We find that Compact Proofs consider many explanatory virtues and are hence a promising approach. Fruitful research directions implied by our framework include (1) clearly defining explanatory simplicity, (2) focusing on unifying explanations and (3) deriving universal principles for neural networks. Improved MI methods enhance our ability to monitor, predict, and steer AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of machine learning (ML) systems necessitates a more comprehensive evaluation of their environmental impact, particularly their carbon footprint, which comprises operational carbon from training and inference execution and embodied carbon from hardware manufacturing and its entire life-cycle. Despite the increasing importance of embodied emissions, there is a lack of tools and frameworks to holistically quantify and optimize the total carbon footprint of ML systems. To address this, we propose CATransformers, a carbon-aware architecture search framework that enables sustainability-driven co-optimization of ML models and hardware architectures. By incorporating both operational and embodied carbon metrics into early design space exploration of domain-specific hardware accelerators, CATransformers demonstrates that optimizing for carbon yields design choices distinct from those optimized solely for latency or energy efficiency. We apply our framework to multi-modal CLIP-based models, producing CarbonCLIP, a family of CLIP models achieving up to 17% reduction in total carbon emissions while maintaining accuracy and latency compared to state-of-the-art edge small CLIP baselines. This work underscores the need for holistic optimization methods to design high-performance, environmentally sustainable AI systems.

Abstract: We propose Derivative Learning (DERL), a supervised approach that models physical systems by learning their partial derivatives. We also leverage DERL to build physical models incrementally, by designing a distillation protocol that effectively transfers knowledge from a pre-trained to a student model. We provide theoretical guarantees that our approach can learn the true physical system, being consistent with the underlying physical laws, even when using empirical derivatives. DERL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizing an ODE to unseen initial conditions and a parametric PDE to unseen parameters. We finally propose a method based on DERL to transfer physical knowledge across models by extending them to new portions of the physical domain and new range of PDE parameters. We believe this is the first attempt at building physical models incrementally in multiple stages.

Abstract: Predicting the price that has the least error and can provide the best and highest accuracy has been one of the most challenging issues and one of the most critical concerns among capital market activists and researchers. Therefore, a model that can solve problems and provide results with high accuracy is one of the topics of interest among researchers. In this project, using time series prediction models such as ARIMA to estimate the price, variables, and indicators related to technical analysis show the behavior of traders involved in involving psychological factors for the model. By linking all of these variables to stepwise regression, we identify the best variables influencing the prediction of the variable. Finally, we enter the selected variables as inputs to the artificial neural network. In other words, we want to call this whole prediction process the "ARIMA_Stepwise Regression_Neural Network" model and try to predict the price of gold in international financial markets. This approach is expected to be able to be used to predict the types of stocks, commodities, currency pairs, financial market indicators, and other items used in local and international financial markets. Moreover, a comparison between the results of this method and time series methods is also expressed. Finally, based on the results, it can be seen that the resulting hybrid model has the highest accuracy compared to the time series method, regression, and stepwise regression.

Abstract: The Everglades play a crucial role in flood and drought regulation, water resource planning, and ecosystem management in the surrounding regions. However, traditional physics-based and statistical methods for predicting water levels often face significant challenges, including high computational costs and limited adaptability to diverse or unforeseen conditions. Recent advancements in large time series models have demonstrated the potential to address these limitations, with state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models achieving remarkable success in time series forecasting across various domains. Despite this progress, their application to critical environmental systems, such as the Everglades, remains underexplored. In this study, we fill the gap by investigating twelve task-specific models and five time series foundation models across six categories for a real-world application focused on water level prediction in the Everglades. Our primary results show that the foundation model, Chronos, significantly outperforms all other models while the remaining foundation models exhibit relatively poor performance. Moreover, the performance of task-specific models varies with the model architectures. Lastly, we discuss the possible reasons for the varying performance of models.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming -- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.

Abstract: Metal additive manufacturing enables unprecedented design freedom and the production of customized, complex components. However, the rapid melting and solidification dynamics inherent to metal AM processes generate heterogeneous, non-equilibrium microstructures that significantly impact mechanical properties and subsequent functionality. Predicting microstructure and its evolution across spatial and temporal scales remains a central challenge for process optimization and defect mitigation. While conventional experimental techniques and physics-based simulations provide a physical foundation and valuable insights, they face critical limitations. In contrast, data-driven machine learning offers an alternative prediction approach and powerful pattern recognition but often operate as black-box, lacking generalizability and physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, physics-informed machine learning, including physics-informed neural networks, has emerged as a promising paradigm by embedding governing physical laws into neural network architectures, thereby enhancing accuracy, transparency, data efficiency, and extrapolation capabilities. This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of modeling strategies for microstructure prediction in metal AM. The strengths and limitations of experimental, computational, and data-driven methods are analyzed in depth, and highlight recent advances in hybrid PIML frameworks that integrate physical knowledge with ML. Key challenges, such as data scarcity, multi-scale coupling, and uncertainty quantification, are discussed alongside future directions. Ultimately, this assessment underscores the importance of PIML-based hybrid approaches in enabling predictive, scalable, and physically consistent microstructure modeling for site-specific, microstructure-aware process control and the reliable production of high-performance AM components.

Abstract: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is fundamental for advanced software development, supporting faster and more efficient delivery of code changes into cloud environments. However, security issues in the CI/CD pipeline remain challenging, and incidents (e.g., DDoS, Bot, Log4j, etc.) are happening over the cloud environments. While plenty of literature discusses static security testing and CI/CD practices, only a few deal with network traffic pattern analysis to detect different cyberattacks. This research aims to enhance CI/CD pipeline security by implementing anomaly detection through AI (Artificial Intelligence) support. The goal is to identify unusual behaviour or variations from network traffic patterns in pipeline and cloud platforms. The system shall integrate into the workflow to continuously monitor pipeline activities and cloud infrastructure. Additionally, it aims to explore adaptive response mechanisms to mitigate the detected anomalies or security threats. This research employed two popular network traffic datasets, CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and CSE-CIC-IDS2017. We implemented a combination of Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to detect unusual traffic patterns. We achieved an accuracy of 98.69% and 98.30% and generated log files in different CI/CD pipeline stages that resemble the network anomalies affected to address security challenges in modern DevOps practices, contributing to advancing software security and reliability.

Abstract: Moral stories are a time-tested vehicle for transmitting values, yet modern NLP lacks a large, structured corpus that couples coherent narratives with explicit ethical lessons. We close this gap with TF1-EN-3M, the first open dataset of three million English-language fables generated exclusively by instruction-tuned models no larger than 8B parameters. Each story follows a six-slot scaffold (character -> trait -> setting -> conflict -> resolution -> moral), produced through a combinatorial prompt engine that guarantees genre fidelity while covering a broad thematic space.
  A hybrid evaluation pipeline blends (i) a GPT-based critic that scores grammar, creativity, moral clarity, and template adherence with (ii) reference-free diversity and readability metrics. Among ten open-weight candidates, an 8B-parameter Llama-3 variant delivers the best quality-speed trade-off, producing high-scoring fables on a single consumer GPU (<24 GB VRAM) at approximately 13.5 cents per 1,000 fables.
  We release the dataset, generation code, evaluation scripts, and full metadata under a permissive license, enabling exact reproducibility and cost benchmarking. TF1-EN-3M opens avenues for research in instruction following, narrative intelligence, value alignment, and child-friendly educational AI, demonstrating that large-scale moral storytelling no longer requires proprietary giant models.

Abstract: Motivated by the emerging demand in the financial industry for the automatic analysis of unstructured and structured data at scale, Question Answering (QA) systems can provide lucrative and competitive advantages to companies by facilitating the decision making of financial advisers. Consequently, we propose a novel financial QA system using the transformer-based pre-trained BERT language model to address the limitations of data scarcity and language specificity in the financial domain. Our system focuses on financial non-factoid answer selection, which retrieves a set of passage-level texts and selects the most relevant as the answer. To increase efficiency, we formulate the answer selection task as a re-ranking problem, in which our system consists of an Answer Retriever using BM25, a simple information retrieval approach, to first return a list of candidate answers, and an Answer Re-ranker built with variants of pre-trained BERT language models to re-rank and select the most relevant answers. We investigate various learning, further pre-training, and fine-tuning approaches for BERT. Our experiments suggest that FinBERT-QA, a model built from applying the Transfer and Adapt further fine-tuning and pointwise learning approach, is the most effective, improving the state-of-the-art results of task 2 of the FiQA dataset by 16% on MRR, 17% on NDCG, and 21% on Precision@1.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel primality test based on the eigenvalue structure of circulant matrices constructed from roots of unity. We prove that an integer $n > 2$ is prime if and only if the minimal polynomial of the circulant matrix $C_n = W_n + W_n^2$ has exactly two irreducible factors over $\mathbb{Q}$. This characterization connects cyclotomic field theory with matrix algebra, providing both theoretical insights and practical applications. We demonstrate that the eigenvalue patterns of these matrices reveal fundamental distinctions between prime and composite numbers, leading to a deterministic primality test. Our approach leverages the relationship between primitive roots of unity, Galois theory, and the factorization of cyclotomic polynomials. We provide comprehensive experimental validation across various ranges of integers, discuss practical implementation considerations, and analyze the computational complexity of our method in comparison with established primality tests. The visual interpretation of our mathematical framework provides intuitive understanding of the algebraic structures that distinguish prime numbers. Our experimental validation demonstrates that our approach offers a deterministic alternative to existing methods, with performance characteristics reflecting its algebraic foundations.

Abstract: Advancements in remote sensing (RS) imagery have provided high-resolution detail and vast coverage, yet existing methods, such as image-level captioning/retrieval and object-level detection/segmentation, often fail to capture mid-scale semantic entities essential for interpreting large-scale scenes. To address this, we propose the conteXtual referring Map (XeMap) task, which focuses on contextual, fine-grained localization of text-referred regions in large-scale RS scenes. Unlike traditional approaches, XeMap enables precise mapping of mid-scale semantic entities that are often overlooked in image-level or object-level methods. To achieve this, we introduce XeMap-Network, a novel architecture designed to handle the complexities of pixel-level cross-modal contextual referring mapping in RS. The network includes a fusion layer that applies self- and cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the interaction between text and image embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Scale Semantic Alignment (HMSA) module that aligns multiscale visual features with the text semantic vector, enabling precise multimodal matching across large-scale RS imagery. To support XeMap task, we provide a novel, annotated dataset, XeMap-set, specifically tailored for this task, overcoming the lack of XeMap datasets in RS imagery. XeMap-Network is evaluated in a zero-shot setting against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. This highlights its effectiveness in accurately mapping referring regions and providing valuable insights for interpreting large-scale RS environments.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose a serious challenge to agriculture by reducing crop yield and affecting food quality. Early detection and classification of these diseases are essential for minimising losses and improving crop management practices. This study applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to classify plant leaf diseases using a dataset containing 70,295 training images and 17,572 validation images across 38 disease classes. The CNN model was trained using the Adam optimiser with a learning rate of 0.0001 and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. After 10 training epochs, the model achieved a training accuracy of 99.1% and a validation accuracy of 96.4%. The LSTM model reached a validation accuracy of 93.43%. Performance was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, confirming the reliability of the CNN-based approach. The results suggest that deep learning models, particularly CNN, enable an effective solution for accurate and scalable plant disease classification, supporting practical applications in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Mobile video analysis systems often encounter various deploying environments, where environment shifts present greater demands for responsiveness in adaptations of deployed "expert DNN models". Existing model adaptation frameworks primarily operate in a cloud-centric way, exhibiting degraded performance during adaptation and delayed reactions to environment shifts. Instead, this paper proposes MOCHA, a novel framework optimizing the responsiveness of continuous model adaptation through hierarchical collaborations between mobile and cloud resources. Specifically, MOCHA (1) reduces adaptation response delays by performing on-device model reuse and fast fine-tuning before requesting cloud model retrieval and end-to-end retraining; (2) accelerates history expert model retrieval by organizing them into a structured taxonomy utilizing domain semantics analyzed by a cloud foundation model as indices; (3) enables efficient local model reuse by maintaining onboard expert model caches for frequent scenes, which proactively prefetch model weights from the cloud model database. Extensive evaluations with real-world videos on three DNN tasks show MOCHA improves the model accuracy during adaptation by up to 6.8% while saving the response delay and retraining time by up to 35.5x and 3.0x respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in building fully autonomous agents. However, fully autonomous LLM-based agents still face significant challenges, including limited reliability due to hallucinations, difficulty in handling complex tasks, and substantial safety and ethical risks, all of which limit their feasibility and trustworthiness in real-world applications. To overcome these limitations, LLM-based human-agent systems (LLM-HAS) incorporate human-provided information, feedback, or control into the agent system to enhance system performance, reliability and safety. This paper provides the first comprehensive and structured survey of LLM-HAS. It clarifies fundamental concepts, systematically presents core components shaping these systems, including environment & profiling, human feedback, interaction types, orchestration and communication, explores emerging applications, and discusses unique challenges and opportunities. By consolidating current knowledge and offering a structured overview, we aim to foster further research and innovation in this rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to understand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic information of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and line-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging. Conventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with several parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the spherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent way as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that spherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions can be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our method to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter mass densities given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled classical safe control methods, such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, to generalize to complex robotic systems operating directly from high-dimensional sensor observations. However, obtaining comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical scenarios during world model training is extremely challenging. As a result, latent safety filters built on top of these models may miss novel hazards and even fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently misclassifying risky out-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this, we introduce an uncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from both known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model's epistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We propose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by calibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing reachability analysis in an augmented state space-spanning both the latent representation and the epistemic uncertainty-we synthesize a latent safety filter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and unseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware safety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably proposes safe, in-distribution actions.

Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are complex and typically only simple systems can be analytically studied. In applications, these systems are usually defined with a set of tunable parameters and as the parameters are varied the system response undergoes significant topological changes or bifurcations. In a high dimensional parameter space, it is difficult to determine which direction to vary the system parameters to achieve a desired system response or state. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for optimally navigating a dynamical system parameter space that is rooted in topological data analysis. Specifically we use the differentiability of persistence diagrams to define a topological language for intuitively promoting or deterring different topological features in the state space response of a dynamical system and use gradient descent to optimally move from one point in the parameter space to another. The end result is a path in this space that guides the system to a set of parameters that yield the desired topological features defined by the loss function. We show a number of examples by applying the methods to different dynamical systems and scenarios to demonstrate how to promote different features and how to choose the hyperparameters to achieve different outcomes.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in areas that significantly impact human lives, concerns about fairness and transparency have grown, especially regarding their impact on protected groups. Recently, the intersection of explainability and fairness has emerged as an important area to promote responsible AI systems. This paper explores how explainability methods can be leveraged to detect and interpret unfairness. We propose a pipeline that integrates local post-hoc explanation methods to derive fairness-related insights. During the pipeline design, we identify and address critical questions arising from the use of explanations as bias detectors such as the relationship between distributive and procedural fairness, the effect of removing the protected attribute, the consistency and quality of results across different explanation methods, the impact of various aggregation strategies of local explanations on group fairness evaluations, and the overall trustworthiness of explanations as bias detectors. Our results show the potential of explanation methods used for fairness while highlighting the need to carefully consider the aforementioned critical aspects.

Abstract: Background: As empirical software engineering evolves, more studies adopt data strategies$-$approaches that investigate digital artifacts such as models, source code, or system logs rather than relying on human subjects. Synthesizing results from such studies introduces new methodological challenges.
  Aims: This study assesses the effects of model quantization on correctness and resource efficiency in deep learning (DL) systems. Additionally, it explores the methodological implications of aggregating evidence from empirical studies that adopt data strategies.
  Method: We conducted a research synthesis of six primary studies that empirically evaluate model quantization. We applied the Structured Synthesis Method (SSM) to aggregate the findings, which combines qualitative and quantitative evidence through diagrammatic modeling. A total of 19 evidence models were extracted and aggregated.
  Results: The aggregated evidence indicates that model quantization weakly negatively affects correctness metrics while consistently improving resource efficiency metrics, including storage size, inference latency, and GPU energy consumption$-$a manageable trade-off for many DL deployment contexts. Evidence across quantization techniques remains fragmented, underscoring the need for more focused empirical studies per technique.
  Conclusions: Model quantization offers substantial efficiency benefits with minor trade-offs in correctness, making it a suitable optimization strategy for resource-constrained environments. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of using SSM to synthesize findings from data strategy-based research.

Abstract: A clustered adaptive intervention (cAI) is a pre-specified sequence of decision rules that guides practitioners on how best - and based on which measures - to tailor cluster-level intervention to improve outcomes at the level of individuals within the clusters. A clustered sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (cSMART) is a type of trial that is used to inform the empirical development of a cAI. The most common type of secondary aim in a cSMART focuses on assessing causal effect moderation by candidate tailoring variables. We introduce a clustered Q-learning framework with the M-out-of-N Cluster Bootstrap using data from a cSMART to evaluate whether a set of candidate tailoring variables may be useful in defining an optimal cAI. This approach could construct confidence intervals (CI) with near-nominal coverage to assess parameters indexing the causal effect moderation function. Specifically, it allows reliable inferences concerning the utility of candidate tailoring variables in constructing a cAI that maximizes a mean end-of-study outcome even when "non-regularity", a well-known challenge exists. Simulations demonstrate the numerical performance of the proposed method across varying non-regularity conditions and investigate the impact of varying number of clusters and intra-cluster correlation coefficient on CI coverage. Methods are applied on ADEPT dataset to inform the construction of a clinic-level cAI for improving evidence-based practice in treating mood disorders.

Abstract: Appropriate modelling of extreme skew surges is crucial, particularly for coastal risk management. Our study focuses on modelling extreme skew surges along the French Atlantic coast, with a particular emphasis on investigating the extremal dependence structure between stations. We employ the peak-over-threshold framework, where a multivariate extreme event is defined whenever at least one location records a large value, though not necessarily all stations simultaneously. A novel method for determining an appropriate level (threshold) above which observations can be classified as extreme is proposed. Two complementary approaches are explored. First, the multivariate generalized Pareto distribution is employed to model extremes, leveraging its properties to derive a generative model that predicts extreme skew surges at one station based on observed extremes at nearby stations. Second, a novel extreme regression framework is assessed for point predictions. This specific regression framework enables accurate point predictions using only the "angle" of input variables, i.e. input variables divided by their norms. The ultimate objective is to reconstruct historical skew surge time series at stations with limited data. This is achieved by integrating extreme skew surge data from stations with longer records, such as Brest and Saint-Nazaire, which provide over 150 years of observations.

Abstract: Next Generation Reservoir Computing (NGRC) is a low-cost machine learning method for forecasting chaotic time series from data. However, ensuring the dynamical stability of NGRC models during autonomous prediction remains a challenge. In this work, we uncover a key connection between the numerical conditioning of the NGRC feature matrix -- formed by polynomial evaluations on time-delay coordinates -- and the long-term NGRC dynamics. Merging tools from numerical linear algebra and ergodic theory of dynamical systems, we systematically study how the feature matrix conditioning varies across hyperparameters. We demonstrate that the NGRC feature matrix tends to be ill-conditioned for short time lags and high-degree polynomials. Ill-conditioning amplifies sensitivity to training data perturbations, which can produce unstable NGRC dynamics. We evaluate the impact of different numerical algorithms (Cholesky, SVD, and LU) for solving the regularized least-squares problem.

Abstract: Driver assistance systems provide a wide range of crucial services, including closely monitoring the condition of vehicles. This paper showcases a groundbreaking sensor health monitoring system designed for the automotive industry. The ingenious system leverages cutting-edge techniques to process data collected from various vehicle sensors. It compares their outputs within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to evaluate the health of each sensor. To unravel the intricate correlations between sensor data, an extensive exploration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies was conducted. Through meticulous analysis, the most correlated sensor data were identified. These valuable insights were then utilized to provide accurate estimations of sensor values. Among the diverse learning methods examined, the combination of autoencoders for detecting sensor failures and random forest regression for estimating sensor values proved to yield the most impressive outcomes. A statistical model using the normal distribution has been developed to identify possible sensor failures proactively. By comparing the actual values of the sensors with their estimated values based on correlated sensors, faulty sensors can be detected early. When a defective sensor is detected, both the driver and the maintenance department are promptly alerted. Additionally, the system replaces the value of the faulty sensor with the estimated value obtained through analysis. This proactive approach was evaluated using data from twenty essential sensors in the Saipa's Quick vehicle's ECU, resulting in an impressive accuracy rate of 99\%.

Abstract: While supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven effective for device authentication via radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, they are hindered by domain shift issues and the scarcity of labeled data. The success of large language models has led to increased interest in unsupervised pre-trained models (PTMs), which offer better generalization and do not require labeled datasets, potentially addressing the issues mentioned above. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of PTMs in RF fingerprinting remain insufficiently explored. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate data-free backdoor attacks on such PTMs in RF fingerprinting, focusing on a practical scenario where attackers lack access to downstream data, label information, and training processes. To realize the backdoor attack, we carefully design a set of triggers and predefined output representations (PORs) for the PTMs. By mapping triggers and PORs through backdoor training, we can implant backdoor behaviors into the PTMs, thereby introducing vulnerabilities across different downstream RF fingerprinting tasks without requiring prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed attack to various input domains, protocols, and PTMs. Furthermore, we explore potential detection and defense methods, demonstrating the difficulty of fully safeguarding against our proposed backdoor attack.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large datasets is critical in applications such as drug discovery, precision medicine, and alignment of large language models (LLMs). While Conformal Selection (CS) provides rigorous uncertainty quantification, it is limited to univariate responses and scalar criteria. To address this issue, we propose Multivariate Conformal Selection (mCS), a generalization of CS designed for multivariate response settings. Our method introduces regional monotonicity and employs multivariate nonconformity scores to construct conformal p-values, enabling finite-sample False Discovery Rate (FDR) control. We present two variants: mCS-dist, using distance-based scores, and mCS-learn, which learns optimal scores via differentiable optimization. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that mCS significantly improves selection power while maintaining FDR control, establishing it as a robust framework for multivariate selection tasks.

Abstract: The last few decades have witnessed a rapid increase in IoT devices owing to their wide range of applications, such as smart healthcare monitoring systems, smart cities, and environmental monitoring. A critical task in IoT networks is sensing and transmitting information over the network. The IoT nodes gather data by sensing the environment and then transmit this data to a destination node via multi-hop communication, following some routing protocols. These protocols are usually designed to optimize possibly contradictory objectives, such as maximizing packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. While most literature has focused on optimizing a static objective that remains unchanged, many real-world IoT applications require adapting to rapidly shifting priorities. For example, in monitoring systems, some transmissions are time-critical and require a high priority on low latency, while other transmissions are less urgent and instead prioritize energy efficiency. To meet such dynamic demands, we propose novel dynamic and distributed routing based on multiobjective Q-learning that can adapt to changes in preferences in real-time. Our algorithm builds on ideas from both multi-objective optimization and Q-learning. We also propose a novel greedy interpolation policy scheme to take near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. The proposed scheme can approximate and utilize the Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic preferences, thus utilizing past knowledge to adapt to unpredictable preferences quickly during runtime. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for various exploration strategies, preference variation patterns, and important metrics like overall reward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio.

Abstract: We introduce the Llama-Nemotron series of models, an open family of heterogeneous reasoning models that deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities, inference efficiency, and an open license for enterprise use. The family comes in three sizes -- Nano (8B), Super (49B), and Ultra (253B) -- and performs competitively with state-of-the-art reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 while offering superior inference throughput and memory efficiency. In this report, we discuss the training procedure for these models, which entails using neural architecture search from Llama 3 models for accelerated inference, knowledge distillation, and continued pretraining, followed by a reasoning-focused post-training stage consisting of two main parts: supervised fine-tuning and large scale reinforcement learning. Llama-Nemotron models are the first open-source models to support a dynamic reasoning toggle, allowing users to switch between standard chat and reasoning modes during inference. To further support open research and facilitate model development, we provide the following resources: 1. We release the Llama-Nemotron reasoning models -- LN-Nano, LN-Super, and LN-Ultra -- under the commercially permissive NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement. 2. We release the complete post-training dataset: Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset. 3. We also release our training codebases: NeMo, NeMo-Aligner, and Megatron-LM.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems leverage powerful language models to generate personalized suggestions by processing user interactions and preferences. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on structured data and collaborative filtering, LLM-based models process textual and contextual information, often using cloud-based infrastructure. This raises privacy concerns, as user data is transmitted to remote servers, increasing the risk of exposure and reducing control over personal information. To address this, we propose a hybrid privacy-preserving recommendation framework which separates sensitive from nonsensitive data and only shares the latter with the cloud to harness LLM-powered recommendations. To restore lost recommendations related to obfuscated sensitive data, we design a de-obfuscation module that reconstructs sensitive recommendations locally. Experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that our framework achieves almost the same recommendation utility with a system which shares all data with an LLM, while preserving privacy to a large extend. Compared to obfuscation-only techniques, our approach improves HR@10 scores and category distribution alignment, offering a better balance between privacy and recommendation quality. Furthermore, our method runs efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, making privacy-aware LLM-based recommendation systems practical for real-world use.

Abstract: User sequence modeling is crucial for modern large-scale recommendation systems, as it enables the extraction of informative representations of users and items from their historical interactions. These user representations are widely used for a variety of downstream tasks to enhance users' online experience. A key challenge for learning these representations is the lack of labeled training data. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have emerged as a promising solution for learning representations from unlabeled data, many existing approaches rely on extensive negative sampling, which can be computationally expensive and may not always be feasible in real-world scenario. In this work, we propose an adaptation of Barlow Twins, a state-of-the-art SSL methods, to user sequence modeling by incorporating suitable augmentation methods. Our approach aims to mitigate the need for large negative sample batches, enabling effective representation learning with smaller batch sizes and limited labeled data. We evaluate our method on the MovieLens-1M, MovieLens-20M, and Yelp datasets, demonstrating that our method consistently outperforms the widely-used dual encoder model across three downstream tasks, achieving an 8%-20% improvement in accuracy. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of our approach in extracting valuable sequence-level information for user modeling, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce and negative examples are limited.

<title>DOLCE: Decomposing Off-Policy Evaluation/Learning into Lagged and Current Effects</title>

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) and off-policy learning (OPL) for contextual bandit policies leverage historical data to evaluate and optimize a target policy. Most existing OPE/OPL methods--based on importance weighting or imputation--assume common support between the target and logging policies. When this assumption is violated, these methods typically require unstable extrapolation, truncation, or conservative strategies for individuals outside the common support assumption. However, such approaches can be inadequate in settings where explicit evaluation or optimization for such individuals is required. To address this issue, we propose DOLCE: Decomposing Off-policy evaluation/learning into Lagged and Current Effects, a novel estimator that leverages contextual information from multiple time points to decompose rewards into lagged and current effects. By incorporating both past and present contexts, DOLCE effectively handles individuals who violate the common support assumption. We show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under two assumptions--local correctness and conditional independence. Our experiments demonstrate that DOLCE achieves substantial improvements in OPE and OPL, particularly as the proportion of individuals outside the common support assumption increases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central to numerous natural language processing tasks, but their vulnerabilities present significant security and ethical challenges. This systematic survey explores the evolving landscape of attack and defense techniques in LLMs. We classify attacks into adversarial prompt attack, optimized attacks, model theft, as well as attacks on application of LLMs, detailing their mechanisms and implications. Consequently, we analyze defense strategies, including prevention-based and detection-based defense methods. Although advances have been made, challenges remain to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape, balance usability with robustness, and address resource constraints in defense implementation. We highlight open problems, including the need for adaptive scalable defenses, explainable security techniques, and standardized evaluation frameworks. This survey provides actionable insights and directions for developing secure and resilient LLMs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations to mitigate risks in real-world applications.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) is critical in data analysis, particularly within the domain of IT security. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in the empirical sciences involves uncovering causal structure through observation and experimentation. Causal discovery entails linking the conditional independence (CI) invariances in observational data to their corresponding graphical constraints via d-separation. In this paper, we consider a general setting where we have access to data from multiple experimental distributions resulting from hard interventions, as well as potentially from an observational distribution. By comparing different interventional distributions, we propose a set of graphical constraints that are fundamentally linked to Pearl's do-calculus within the framework of hard interventions. These graphical constraints associate each graphical structure with a set of interventional distributions that are consistent with the rules of do-calculus. We characterize the interventional equivalence class of causal graphs with latent variables and introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine whether two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent, i.e., whether they are associated with the same family of hard interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances from do-calculus. We also propose a learning algorithm to integrate multiple datasets from hard interventions, introducing new orientation rules. The learning objective is a tuple of augmented graphs which entails a set of causal graphs. We also prove the soundness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) are increasingly deployed to offer advanced capabilities on inputs comprising both text and images. While prior research has shown that adversarial attacks can transfer from open-source to proprietary black-box models in text-only and vision-only contexts, the extent and effectiveness of such vulnerabilities remain underexplored for VLLMs. We present a comprehensive analysis demonstrating that targeted adversarial examples are highly transferable to widely-used proprietary VLLMs such as GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini. We show that attackers can craft perturbations to induce specific attacker-chosen interpretations of visual information, such as misinterpreting hazardous content as safe, overlooking sensitive or restricted material, or generating detailed incorrect responses aligned with the attacker's intent. Furthermore, we discover that universal perturbations -- modifications applicable to a wide set of images -- can consistently induce these misinterpretations across multiple proprietary VLLMs. Our experimental results on object recognition, visual question answering, and image captioning show that this vulnerability is common across current state-of-the-art models, and underscore an urgent need for robust mitigations to ensure the safe and secure deployment of VLLMs.

Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) offers strong performance in nonlinear and contact-rich robotic tasks, yet often suffers from poor exploration due to locally greedy sampling schemes. We propose \emph{Model Tensor Planning} (MTP), a novel sampling-based MPC framework that introduces high-entropy control trajectory generation through structured tensor sampling. By sampling over randomized multipartite graphs and interpolating control trajectories with B-splines and Akima splines, MTP ensures smooth and globally diverse control candidates. We further propose a simple $\beta$-mixing strategy that blends local exploitative and global exploratory samples within the modified Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) update, balancing control refinement and exploration. Theoretically, we show that MTP achieves asymptotic path coverage and maximum entropy in the control trajectory space in the limit of infinite tensor depth and width.
  Our implementation is fully vectorized using JAX and compatible with MuJoCo XLA, supporting \emph{Just-in-time} (JIT) compilation and batched rollouts for real-time control with online domain randomization. Through experiments on various challenging robotic tasks, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation to humanoid locomotion, we demonstrate that MTP outperforms standard MPC and evolutionary strategy baselines in task success and control robustness. Design and sensitivity ablations confirm the effectiveness of MTP tensor sampling structure, spline interpolation choices, and mixing strategy. Altogether, MTP offers a scalable framework for robust exploration in model-based planning and control.

Abstract: Fine-grained Visual Recognition (FGVR) involves distinguishing between visually similar categories, which is inherently challenging due to subtle inter-class differences and the need for large, expert-annotated datasets. In domains like medical imaging, such curated datasets are unavailable due to issues like privacy concerns and high annotation costs. In such scenarios lacking labeled data, an FGVR model cannot rely on a predefined set of training labels, and hence has an unconstrained output space for predictions. We refer to this task as Vocabulary-Free FGVR (VF-FGVR), where a model must predict labels from an unconstrained output space without prior label information. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential for VF-FGVR, querying these models for each test input is impractical because of high costs and prohibitive inference times. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{Nea}rest-Neighbor Label \textbf{R}efinement (NeaR), a novel approach that fine-tunes a downstream CLIP model using labels generated by an MLLM. Our approach constructs a weakly supervised dataset from a small, unlabeled training set, leveraging MLLMs for label generation. NeaR is designed to handle the noise, stochasticity, and open-endedness inherent in labels generated by MLLMs, and establishes a new benchmark for efficient VF-FGVR.

Abstract: Digital Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have shown great promise in Deep Neural Network (DNN) acceleration by effectively addressing the "memory wall" bottleneck. However, the development and optimization of digital CIM accelerators are hindered by the lack of comprehensive tools that encompass both software and hardware design spaces. Moreover, existing design and evaluation frameworks often lack support for the capacity constraints inherent in digital CIM architectures. In this paper, we present CIMFlow, an integrated framework that provides an out-of-the-box workflow for implementing and evaluating DNN workloads on digital CIM architectures. CIMFlow bridges the compilation and simulation infrastructures with a flexible instruction set architecture (ISA) design, and addresses the constraints of digital CIM through advanced partitioning and parallelism strategies in the compilation flow. Our evaluation demonstrates that CIMFlow enables systematic prototyping and optimization of digital CIM architectures across diverse configurations, providing researchers and designers with an accessible platform for extensive design space exploration.

However, BBO often struggles with high-dimensional problems and limited trial budgets. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on meta-learning to pre-compute a reduced-dimensional manifold where optimal points lie for a specific class of optimization problems. When optimizing a new problem instance sampled from the class, black-box optimization is carried out in the reduced-dimensional space, effectively reducing the effort required for finding near-optimal solutions.

Abstract: Atomistic modeling of thin-film processes provides an avenue not only for discovering key chemical mechanisms of the processes but also to extract quantitative metrics on the events and reactions taking place at the gas-surface interface. Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational method to study the evolution of a process at the atomic scale, but studies of industrially relevant processes usually require suitable force fields, which are in general not available for all processes of interest. However, machine learned force fields (MLFF) are conquering the field of computational materials and surface science. In this paper, we demonstrate how to efficiently build MLFFs suitable for process simulations and provide two examples for technologically relevant processes: precursor pulse in the atomic layer deposition of HfO2 and atomic layer etching of MoS2.

Abstract: In software development, technical debt (TD) refers to suboptimal implementation choices made by the developers to meet urgent deadlines and limited resources, posing challenges for future maintenance. Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is a sub-type of TD, representing specific TD instances ``openly admitted'' by the developers and often expressed through source code comments. Previous research on SATD has focused predominantly on the Java programming language, revealing a significant gap in cross-language SATD. Such a narrow focus limits the generalizability of existing findings as well as SATD detection techniques across multiple programming languages. Our work addresses such limitation by introducing CppSATD, a dedicated C++ SATD dataset, comprising over 531,000 annotated comments and their source code contexts. Our dataset can serve as a foundation for future studies that aim to develop SATD detection methods in C++, generalize the existing findings to other languages, or contribute novel insights to cross-language SATD research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is critical to assess the security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise both during their training phase and after models have been deployed. This survey seeks to define and categorize the various attacks targeting LLMs, distinguishing between those that occur during the training phase and those that affect already trained models. A thorough analysis of these attacks is presented, alongside an exploration of defense mechanisms designed to mitigate such threats. Defenses are classified into two primary categories: prevention-based and detection-based defenses. Furthermore, our survey summarizes possible attacks and their corresponding defense strategies. It also provides an evaluation of the effectiveness of the known defense mechanisms for the different security threats. Our survey aims to offer a structured framework for securing LLMs, while also identifying areas that require further research to improve and strengthen defenses against emerging security challenges.

<title>A flexible Bayesian non-parametric mixture model reveals multiple dependencies of swap errors in visual working memory</title>

Abstract: Human behavioural data in psychophysics has been used to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of many cognitive processes, such as attention, sensorimotor integration, and perceptual decision making. Visual working memory has particularly benefited from this approach: analyses of VWM errors have proven crucial for understanding VWM capacity and coding schemes, in turn constraining neural models of both. One poorly understood class of VWM errors are swap errors, whereby participants recall an uncued item from memory. Swap errors could arise from erroneous memory encoding, noisy storage, or errors at retrieval time - previous research has mostly implicated the latter two. However, these studies made strong a priori assumptions on the detailed mechanisms and/or parametric form of errors contributed by these sources. Here, we pursue a data-driven approach instead, introducing a Bayesian non-parametric mixture model of swap errors (BNS) which provides a flexible descriptive model of swapping behaviour, such that swaps are allowed to depend on both the probed and reported features of every stimulus item. We fit BNS to the trial-by-trial behaviour of human participants and show that it recapitulates the strong dependence of swaps on cue similarity in multiple datasets. Critically, BNS reveals that this dependence coexists with a non-monotonic modulation in the report feature dimension for a random dot motion direction-cued, location-reported dataset. The form of the modulation inferred by BNS opens new questions about the importance of memory encoding in causing swap errors in VWM, a distinct source to the previously suggested binding and cueing errors. Our analyses, combining qualitative comparisons of the highly interpretable BNS parameter structure with rigorous quantitative model comparison and recovery methods, show that previous interpretations of swap errors may have been incomplete.

Abstract: LoRaWAN technology's extensive coverage positions it as a strong contender for large-scale IoT deployments. However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.

Abstract: Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for intelligent decision-making in vehicular networks, helping to address challenges such as limited communication resources, high vehicle mobility, and data heterogeneity. However, HFL remains vulnerable to adversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly compromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic vehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL architecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient ascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment for each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and anomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity analyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional deviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive thresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric, dynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each vehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing vehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented, which assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy vehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency check is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple compromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms form a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions effectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and 3-hop topologies.

Abstract: Bootstrap is a common tool for quantifying uncertainty in data analysis. However, besides additional computational costs in the application of the bootstrap on massive data, a challenging problem in bootstrap based inference under Differential Privacy consists in the fact that it requires repeated access to the data. As a consequence, bootstrap based differentially private inference requires a significant increase of the privacy budget, which on the other hand comes with a substantial loss in statistical accuracy.
  A potential solution to reconcile the conflicting goals of statistical accuracy and privacy is to analyze the data under parametric model assumptions and in the last decade, several parametric bootstrap methods for inference under privacy have been investigated. However, uncertainty quantification by parametric bootstrap is only valid if the the quantities of interest can be identified as the parameters of a statistical model and the imposed model assumptions are (at least approximately) satisfied. An alternative to parametric methods is the empirical bootstrap that is a widely used tool for non-parametric inference and well studied in the non-private regime. However, under privacy, less insight is available. In this paper, we propose a private empirical $m$ out of $n$ bootstrap and validate its consistency and privacy guarantees under Gaussian Differential Privacy. Compared to the the private $n$ out of $n$ bootstrap, our approach has several advantages. First, it comes with less computational costs, in particular for massive data. Second, the proposed procedure needs less additional noise in the bootstrap iterations, which leads to an improved statistical accuracy while asymptotically guaranteeing the same level of privacy. Third, we demonstrate much better finite sample properties compared to the currently available procedures.

<title>Gender Bias in Explainability: Investigating Performance Disparity in Post-hoc Methods</title>

Abstract: While research on applications and evaluations of explanation methods continues to expand, fairness of the explanation methods concerning disparities in their performance across subgroups remains an often overlooked aspect. In this paper, we address this gap by showing that, across three tasks and five language models, widely used post-hoc feature attribution methods exhibit significant gender disparity with respect to their faithfulness, robustness, and complexity. These disparities persist even when the models are pre-trained or fine-tuned on particularly unbiased datasets, indicating that the disparities we observe are not merely consequences of biased training data. Our results highlight the importance of addressing disparities in explanations when developing and applying explainability methods, as these can lead to biased outcomes against certain subgroups, with particularly critical implications in high-stakes contexts. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of incorporating the fairness of explanations, alongside overall model fairness and explainability, as a requirement in regulatory frameworks.

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) models continue to evolve and become integral to high-stakes applications, ensuring their interpretability remains a critical challenge. Given the growing variety of explainability methods and diverse stakeholder requirements, frameworks that help stakeholders select appropriate explanations tailored to their specific use cases are increasingly important. To address this need, we introduce EvalxNLP, a Python framework for benchmarking state-of-the-art feature attribution methods for transformer-based NLP models. EvalxNLP integrates eight widely recognized explainability techniques from the Explainable AI (XAI) literature, enabling users to generate and evaluate explanations based on key properties such as faithfulness, plausibility, and complexity. Our framework also provides interactive, LLM-based textual explanations, facilitating user understanding of the generated explanations and evaluation outcomes. Human evaluation results indicate high user satisfaction with EvalxNLP, suggesting it is a promising framework for benchmarking explanation methods across diverse user groups. By offering a user-friendly and extensible platform, EvalxNLP aims at democratizing explainability tools and supporting the systematic comparison and advancement of XAI techniques in NLP.

Abstract: Humans (and many vertebrates) face the problem of fusing together multiple fixations of a scene in order to obtain a representation of the whole, where each fixation uses a high-resolution fovea and decreasing resolution in the periphery. In this paper we explicitly represent the retinal transformation of a fixation as a linear downsampling of a high-resolution latent image of the scene, exploiting the known geometry. This linear transformation allows us to carry out exact inference for the latent variables in factor analysis (FA) and mixtures of FA models of the scene. Further, this allows us to formulate and solve the choice of "where to look next" as a Bayesian experimental design problem using the Expected Information Gain criterion. Experiments on the Frey faces and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.

Abstract: Online multi-object tracking has been recently dominated by tracking-by-detection (TbD) methods, where recent advances rely on increasingly sophisticated heuristics for tracklet representation, feature fusion, and multi-stage matching. The key strength of TbD lies in its modular design, enabling the integration of specialized off-the-shelf models like motion predictors and re-identification. However, the extensive usage of human-crafted rules for temporal associations makes these methods inherently limited in their ability to capture the complex interplay between various tracking cues. In this work, we introduce CAMEL, a novel association module for Context-Aware Multi-Cue ExpLoitation, that learns resilient association strategies directly from data, breaking free from hand-crafted heuristics while maintaining TbD's valuable modularity. At its core, CAMEL employs two transformer-based modules and relies on a novel association-centric training scheme to effectively model the complex interactions between tracked targets and their various association cues. Unlike end-to-end detection-by-tracking approaches, our method remains lightweight and fast to train while being able to leverage external off-the-shelf models. Our proposed online tracking pipeline, CAMELTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tracking benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/TrackingLaboratory/CAMELTrack.

Abstract: Bilevel optimization has recently attracted significant attention in machine learning due to its wide range of applications and advanced hierarchical optimization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, named PnPBO, for developing and analyzing stochastic bilevel optimization methods. This framework integrates both modern unbiased and biased stochastic estimators into the single-loop bilevel optimization framework introduced in [9], with several improvements. In the implementation of PnPBO, all stochastic estimators for different variables can be independently incorporated, and an additional moving average technique is applied when using an unbiased estimator for the upper-level variable. In the theoretical analysis, we provide a unified convergence and complexity analysis for PnPBO, demonstrating that the adaptation of various stochastic estimators (including PAGE, ZeroSARAH, and mixed strategies) within the PnPBO framework achieves optimal sample complexity, comparable to that of single-level optimization. This resolves the open question of whether the optimal complexity bounds for solving bilevel optimization are identical to those for single-level optimization. Finally, we empirically validate our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness on several benchmark problems and confirming our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The capabilities of additive manufacturing have facilitated the design and production of mechanical metamaterials with diverse unit cell geometries. Establishing linkages between the vast design space of unit cells and their effective mechanical properties is critical for the efficient design and performance evaluation of such metamaterials. However, physics-based simulations of metamaterial unit cells across the entire design space are computationally expensive, necessitating a materials informatics framework to efficiently capture complex structure-property relationships. In this work, principal component analysis of 2-point correlation functions is performed to extract the salient features from a large dataset of randomly generated 2D metamaterials. Physics-based simulations are performed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach to efficiently compute the homogenized effective elastic stiffness across the extensive unit cell designs. Subsequently, Gaussian process regression is used to generate reduced-order surrogates, mapping unit cell designs to their homogenized effective elastic constant. It is demonstrated that the adopted workflow enables a high-value low-dimensional representation of the voluminous stochastic metamaterial dataset, facilitating the construction of robust structure-property maps. Finally, an uncertainty-based active learning framework is utilized to train a surrogate model with a significantly smaller number of data points compared to the original full dataset. It is shown that a dataset as small as $0.61\%$ of the entire dataset is sufficient to generate accurate and robust structure-property maps.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation plays a key role in applications such as virtual avatars, gaming, and digital content creation. While existing methods have made significant progress in achieving accurate lip synchronization and generating basic emotional expressions, they often struggle to capture and effectively transfer nuanced performance styles. We propose a novel example-based generation framework that conditions a latent diffusion model on a reference style clip to produce highly expressive and temporally coherent facial animations. To address the challenge of accurately adhering to the style reference, we introduce a novel conditioning mechanism called style basis, which extracts key poses from the reference and additively guides the diffusion generation process to fit the style without compromising lip synchronization quality. This approach enables the model to capture subtle stylistic cues while ensuring that the generated animations align closely with the input speech. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and perceptual evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in faithfully reproducing the desired style while achieving superior lip synchronization across various speech scenarios.

<title>How much to Dereverberate? Low-Latency Single-Channel Speech Enhancement in Distant Microphone Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Dereverberation is an important sub-task of Speech Enhancement (SE) to improve the signal's intelligibility and quality. However, it remains challenging because the reverberation is highly correlated with the signal. Furthermore, the single-channel SE literature has predominantly focused on rooms with short reverb times (typically under 1 second), smaller rooms (under volumes of 1000 cubic meters) and relatively short distances (up to 2 meters). In this paper, we explore real-time low-latency single-channel SE under distant microphone scenarios, such as 5 to 10 meters, and focus on conference rooms and theatres, with larger room dimensions and reverberation times. Such a setup is useful for applications such as lecture demonstrations, drama, and to enhance stage acoustics. First, we show that single-channel SE in such challenging scenarios is feasible. Second, we investigate the relationship between room volume and reverberation time, and demonstrate its importance when randomly simulating room impulse responses. Lastly, we show that for dereverberation with short decay times, preserving early reflections before decaying the transfer function of the room improves overall signal quality.

Abstract: The efficient computation of parametric solution sensitivities is a key challenge in the integration of learning-enhanced methods with nonlinear model predictive control (MPC), as their availability is crucial for many learning algorithms. While approaches presented in the machine learning community are limited to convex or unconstrained formulations, this paper discusses the computation of solution sensitivities of general nonlinear programs (NLPs) using the implicit function theorem (IFT) and smoothed optimality conditions treated in interior-point methods (IPM). We detail sensitivity computation within a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) method which employs an IPM for the quadratic subproblems. The publication is accompanied by an efficient open-source implementation within the framework, providing both forward and adjoint sensitivities for general optimal control problems, achieving speedups exceeding 3x over the state-of-the-art solver mpc.pytorch.

<title>Provable Efficiency of Guidance in Diffusion Models for General Data Distribution</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with guidance techniques playing a crucial role in enhancing sample quality. Despite their empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the guidance effect remains limited. Existing studies only focus on case studies, where the distribution conditioned on each class is either isotropic Gaussian or supported on a one-dimensional interval with some extra conditions. How to analyze the guidance effect beyond these case studies remains an open question. Towards closing this gap, we make an attempt to analyze diffusion guidance under general data distributions. Rather than demonstrating uniform sample quality improvement, which does not hold in some distributions, we prove that guidance can improve the whole sample quality, in the sense that the average reciprocal of the classifier probability decreases with the existence of guidance. This aligns with the motivation of introducing guidance.

<title>Global Collinearity-aware Polygonizer for Polygonal Building Mapping in Remote Sensing</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of mapping polygonal buildings from remote sensing images and introduces a novel algorithm, the Global Collinearity-aware Polygonizer (GCP). GCP, built upon an instance segmentation framework, processes binary masks produced by any instance segmentation model. The algorithm begins by collecting polylines sampled along the contours of the binary masks. These polylines undergo a refinement process using a transformer-based regression module to ensure they accurately fit the contours of the targeted building instances. Subsequently, a collinearity-aware polygon simplification module simplifies these refined polylines and generate the final polygon representation. This module employs dynamic programming technique to optimize an objective function that balances the simplicity and fidelity of the polygons, achieving globally optimal solutions. Furthermore, the optimized collinearity-aware objective is seamlessly integrated into network training, enhancing the cohesiveness of the entire pipeline. The effectiveness of GCP has been validated on two public benchmarks for polygonal building mapping. Further experiments reveal that applying the collinearity-aware polygon simplification module to arbitrary polylines, without prior knowledge, enhances accuracy over traditional methods such as the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This finding underscores the broad applicability of GCP. The code for the proposed method will be made available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach combining Multimodal Deep Learning with intrinsic eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict pathological response in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Due to the limitations of existing radiomics and unimodal deep learning approaches, we introduce an intermediate fusion strategy that integrates imaging and clinical data, enabling efficient interaction between data modalities. The proposed Multimodal Doctor-in-the-Loop method further enhances clinical relevance by embedding clinicians' domain knowledge directly into the training process, guiding the model's focus gradually from broader lung regions to specific lesions. Results demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and explainability, providing insights into optimal data integration strategies for clinical applications.

Abstract: Self-improvement requires robotic systems to initially learn from human-provided data and then gradually enhance their capabilities through interaction with the environment. This is similar to how humans improve their skills through continuous practice. However, achieving effective self-improvement is challenging, primarily because robots tend to repeat their existing abilities during interactions, often failing to generate new, valuable data for learning. In this paper, we identify the key to successful self-improvement: modal-level exploration and data selection. By incorporating a modal-level exploration mechanism during policy execution, the robot can produce more diverse and multi-modal interactions. At the same time, we select the most valuable trials and high-quality segments from these interactions for learning. We successfully demonstrate effective robot self-improvement on both simulation benchmarks and real-world experiments. The capability for self-improvement will enable us to develop more robust and high-success-rate robotic control strategies at a lower cost.

<title>VIDSTAMP: A Temporally-Aware Watermark for Ownership and Integrity in Video Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2505.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid rise of video diffusion models has enabled the generation of highly realistic and temporally coherent videos, raising critical concerns about content authenticity, provenance, and misuse. Existing watermarking approaches, whether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often struggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion, dropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we introduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or per-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video diffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage pipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation, and then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency, VIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal perceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions and temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and offers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining comparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds 768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a log P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score of 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior methods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

<title>Negative Stepsizes Make Gradient-Descent-Ascent Converge</title>

Abstract: Efficient computation of min-max problems is a central question in optimization, learning, games, and controls. Arguably the most natural algorithm is gradient-descent-ascent (GDA). However, since the 1970s, conventional wisdom has argued that GDA fails to converge even on simple problems. This failure spurred an extensive literature on modifying GDA with additional building blocks such as extragradients, optimism, momentum, anchoring, etc. In contrast, we show that GDA converges in its original form by simply using a judicious choice of stepsizes.
  The key innovation is the proposal of unconventional stepsize schedules (dubbed slingshot stepsize schedules) that are time-varying, asymmetric, and periodically negative. We show that all three properties are necessary for convergence, and that altogether this enables GDA to converge on the classical counterexamples (e.g., unconstrained convex-concave problems). All of our results apply to the last iterate of GDA, as is typically desired in practice.
  The core algorithmic intuition is that although negative stepsizes make backward progress, they de-synchronize the min and max variables (overcoming the cycling issue of GDA), and lead to a slingshot phenomenon in which the forward progress in the other iterations is overwhelmingly larger. This results in fast overall convergence. Geometrically, the slingshot dynamics leverage the non-reversibility of gradient flow: positive/negative steps cancel to first order, yielding a second-order net movement in a new direction that leads to convergence and is otherwise impossible for GDA to move in. We interpret this as a second-order finite-differencing algorithm and show that, intriguingly, it approximately implements consensus optimization, an empirically popular algorithm for min-max problems involving deep neural networks (e.g., training GANs).

Abstract: Human motion modeling traditionally separates motion generation and estimation into distinct tasks with specialized models. Motion generation models focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text, audio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate motion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying representations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits knowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We present GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion estimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to reformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the output motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging the synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global motion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce an estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with 2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity. Furthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed multimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals, offering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits: generative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like occlusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist framework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single model.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially learning to estimate, in the mean squared error (MSE) sense, a Gaussian $K$-vector of unknown covariance by observing only $m < K$ of its entries in each round. We propose two MSE estimators, and analyze their concentration properties. The first estimator is non-adaptive, as it is tied to a predetermined $m$-subset and lacks the flexibility to transition to alternative subsets. The second estimator, which is derived using a regression framework, is adaptive and exhibits better concentration bounds in comparison to the first estimator. We frame the MSE estimation problem with bandit feedback, where the objective is to find the MSE-optimal subset with high confidence. We propose a variant of the successive elimination algorithm to solve this problem. We also derive a minimax lower bound to understand the fundamental limit on the sample complexity of this problem.

Abstract: Smart traffic lights in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) are envisioned to greatly increase traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control traffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network. However, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper, we investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent behavior ``greenwave" (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green lights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid road network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with multiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the traffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection, we verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding policy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN algorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive observations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent behavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave" policy emerges. We also verify the ``greenwave" patterns in a $5 \times 10$ grid road network. Thirdly, the ``greenwave" patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce favorable solutions since the ``greenwave" policy shown in experiment results is proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple cross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a grid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.

Abstract: We study the complexity of optimizing nonsmooth nonconvex Lipschitz functions by producing $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. Several recent works have presented randomized algorithms that produce such points using $\tilde O(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ first-order oracle calls, independent of the dimension $d$. It has been an open problem as to whether a similar result can be obtained via a deterministic algorithm. We resolve this open problem, showing that randomization is necessary to obtain a dimension-free rate. In particular, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ for any deterministic algorithm. Moreover, we show that unlike smooth or convex optimization, access to function values is required for any deterministic algorithm to halt within any finite time.
  On the other hand, we prove that if the function is even slightly smooth, then the dimension-free rate of $\tilde O(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ can be obtained by a deterministic algorithm with merely a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness parameter. Motivated by these findings, we turn to study the complexity of deterministically smoothing Lipschitz functions. Though there are efficient black-box randomized smoothings, we start by showing that no such deterministic procedure can smooth functions in a meaningful manner, resolving an open question. We then bypass this impossibility result for the structured case of ReLU neural networks. To that end, in a practical white-box setting in which the optimizer is granted access to the network's architecture, we propose a simple, dimension-free, deterministic smoothing that provably preserves $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. Our method applies to a variety of architectures of arbitrary depth, including ResNets and ConvNets. Combined with our algorithm, this yields the first deterministic dimension-free algorithm for optimizing ReLU networks, circumventing our lower bound.

Abstract: We introduce an adaptive method with formal quality guarantees for weak supervision in a non-stationary setting. Our goal is to infer the unknown labels of a sequence of data by using weak supervision sources that provide independent noisy signals of the correct classification for each data point. This setting includes crowdsourcing and programmatic weak supervision. We focus on the non-stationary case, where the accuracy of the weak supervision sources can drift over time, e.g., because of changes in the underlying data distribution. Due to the drift, older data could provide misleading information to infer the label of the current data point. Previous work relied on a priori assumptions on the magnitude of the drift to decide how much data to use from the past. In contrast, our algorithm does not require any assumptions on the drift, and it adapts based on the input by dynamically varying its window size. In particular, at each step, our algorithm estimates the current accuracies of the weak supervision sources by identifying a window of past observations that guarantees a near-optimal minimization of the trade-off between the error due to the variance of the estimation and the error due to the drift. Experiments on synthetic and real-world labelers show that our approach adapts to the drift.

Abstract: Recent advances in the literature show promising potential of deep learning methods, particularly neural operators, in obtaining numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) beyond the reach of current numerical solvers. However, existing data-driven approaches often rely on training data produced by numerical PDE solvers (e.g., finite difference or finite element methods). We introduce a "backward" data generation method that avoids solving the PDE numerically: by randomly sampling candidate solutions $u_j$ from the appropriate solution space (e.g., $H_0^1(\Omega)$), we compute the corresponding right-hand side $f_j$ directly from the equation by differentiation. This produces training pairs ${(f_j, u_j)}$ by computing derivatives rather than solving a PDE numerically for each data point, enabling fast, large-scale data generation consisting of exact solutions. Experiments indicate that models trained on this synthetic data generalize well when tested on data produced by standard solvers. While the idea is simple, we hope this method will expand the potential of neural PDE solvers that do not rely on classical numerical solvers to generate their data.

Abstract: Continual learning is crucial for applying machine learning in challenging, dynamic, and often resource-constrained environments. However, catastrophic forgetting - overwriting previously learned knowledge when new information is acquired - remains a major challenge. In this work, we examine the intermediate representations in neural network layers during continual learning and find that such representations are less prone to forgetting, highlighting their potential to accelerate computation. Motivated by these findings, we propose to use auxiliary classifiers(ACs) to enhance performance and demonstrate that integrating ACs into various continual learning methods consistently improves accuracy across diverse evaluation settings, yielding an average 10% relative gain. We also leverage the ACs to reduce the average cost of the inference by 10-60% without compromising accuracy, enabling the model to return the predictions before computing all the layers. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning.

Abstract: Many variants of Optimal Transport (OT) have been developed to address its heavy computation. Among them, notably, Sliced Wasserstein (SW) is widely used for application domains by projecting the OT problem onto one-dimensional lines, and leveraging the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden. However, projecting measures onto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose to replace one-dimensional lines with a more intricate structure, called tree systems. This structure is metrizable by a tree metric, which yields a closed-form expression for OT problems on tree systems. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to formally define tree systems with their topological properties, introduce the concept of splitting maps, which operate as the projection mechanism onto these structures, then finally propose a novel variant of Radon transform for tree systems and verify its injectivity. This framework leads to an efficient metric between measures, termed Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL). By conducting a variety of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models, we illustrate that our proposed approach performs favorably compared to SW and its variants.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped the landscape of artificial intelligence by demonstrating exceptional performance across various tasks. However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.

Abstract: Modern privacy regulations have spurred the evolution of machine unlearning, a technique that enables the removal of data from an already trained ML model without requiring retraining from scratch. Previous unlearning methods tend to induce the model to achieve lowest classification accuracy on the removal data. Nonetheless, the authentic objective of machine unlearning is to align the unlearned model with the gold model, i.e., achieving the same classification accuracy as the gold model. For this purpose, we present a Twin Machine Unlearning (TMU) approach, where a twin unlearning problem is defined corresponding to the original unlearning problem. As a results, the generalization-label predictor trained on the twin problem can be transferred to the original problem, facilitating aligned data removal. Comprehensive empirical experiments illustrate that our approach significantly enhances the alignment between the unlearned model and the gold model. Meanwhile, our method allows data removal without compromising the model accuracy.

Abstract: This paper studies asynchronous stochastic approximation (SA) algorithms and their theoretical application to reinforcement learning in semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs) with an average-reward criterion. We first extend Borkar and Meyn's stability proof method to accommodate more general noise conditions, yielding broader convergence guarantees for asynchronous SA. To sharpen the convergence analysis, we further examine shadowing properties in the asynchronous setting, building on a dynamical-systems approach of Hirsch and Bena\"{i}m. Leveraging these SA results, we establish the convergence of an asynchronous SA analogue of Schweitzer's classical relative value iteration algorithm, RVI Q-learning, for finite-space, weakly communicating SMDPs. Moreover, to make full use of these SA results in this application, we introduce new monotonicity conditions for estimating the optimal reward rate in RVI Q-learning. These conditions substantially expand the previously considered algorithmic framework, and we address them with novel arguments in the stability and convergence analysis of RVI Q-learning.

Abstract: The inherent uncertainty in the environmental transition model of Reinforcement Learning (RL) necessitates a delicate balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is crucial for optimizing computational resources to accurately estimate expected rewards for the agent. In scenarios with sparse rewards, such as robotic control systems, achieving this balance is particularly challenging. However, given that many environments possess extensive prior knowledge, learning from the ground up in such contexts may be redundant. To address this issue, we propose Language Model Guided reward Tuning (LMGT), a novel, sample-efficient framework. LMGT leverages the comprehensive prior knowledge embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their proficiency in processing non-standard data forms, such as wiki tutorials. By utilizing LLM-guided reward shifts, LMGT adeptly balances exploration and exploitation, thereby guiding the agent's exploratory behavior and enhancing sample efficiency. We have rigorously evaluated LMGT across various RL tasks and evaluated it in the embodied robotic environment Housekeep. Our results demonstrate that LMGT consistently outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that our framework can substantially reduce the computational resources required during the RL training phase.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based models than twenty existing methods.

Abstract: Pretrained foundation models have exhibited extraordinary in-context learning performance, allowing zero-shot generalization to new tasks not encountered during pretraining. In the case of reinforcement learning (RL), in-context RL (ICRL) emerges when pretraining FMs on decision-making problems in an autoregressive-supervised manner. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art ICRL algorithms, like Algorithm Distillation, Decision Pretrained Transformer and Decision Importance Transformer, impose stringent requirements on the pretraining dataset concerning the source policies, context information, and action labels. Notably, these algorithms either demand optimal policies or require varying degrees of well-trained behavior policies for all pretraining environments. This significantly hinders the application of ICRL to real-world scenarios, where acquiring optimal or well-trained policies for a substantial volume of real-world training environments can be intractable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, termed State-Action Distillation (SAD), that allows to generate an effective pretraining dataset guided solely by random policies. In particular, SAD selects query states and corresponding action labels by distilling outstanding state-action pairs from the entire state and action spaces by using random policies within a trust horizon, and then inherits the classical autoregressive-supervised mechanism during pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables effective ICRL under random policies and random contexts. We also establish quantitative analysis of the trustworthiness as well as the performance guarantees of SAD. Moreover, our empirical results across multiple popular ICRL benchmark environments demonstrate that, on average, SAD outperforms the best baseline by 236.3% in the offline evaluation and by 135.2% in the online evaluation.

Abstract: Despite their tremendous success and versatility, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) such as Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from inference inefficiency and rely on advanced computational infrastructure. To address these challenges and make these models more accessible and cost-effective, in this paper, we propose algorithms to improve the inference time and memory efficiency of DNNs with binary and ternary weight matrices. Particularly focusing on matrix multiplication as the bottleneck operation of inference, we observe that, once trained, the weight matrices of a model no longer change. This allows us to preprocess these matrices and create indices that help reduce the storage requirements by a logarithmic factor while enabling our efficient inference algorithms. Specifically, for a $n\times n$ weight matrix, our efficient algorithm guarantees a time complexity of $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, a logarithmic factor improvement over the standard vector-matrix multiplication. Besides theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the practical efficiency of our algorithms. Our results confirm the superiority of our approach both with respect to time and memory, as we observed a reduction in the multiplication time up to 29x and memory usage up to 6x. When applied to LLMs, our experiments show up to a 5.24x speedup in the inference time.

Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) is increasingly employed in privacy-preserving machine learning to protect user data before sharing it with an untrusted aggregator. Most LDP methods assume that users possess only a single data record, which is a significant limitation since users often gather extensive datasets (e.g., images, text, time-series data) and frequently have access to public datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a locally private sampling framework that leverages both the private and public datasets of each user. Specifically, we assume each user has two distributions: $p$ and $q$ that represent their private dataset and the public dataset, respectively. The objective is to design a mechanism that generates a private sample approximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving $q$. We frame this objective as a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility measure. We fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general $f$-divergences provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this optimal mechanism is universal across all $f$-divergences. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our minimax optimal sampler compared to the state-of-the-art locally private sampler.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.

We model driving as a sequential decision-making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.

Abstract: Surrogate models are frequently employed as efficient substitutes for the costly execution of real-world processes. However, constructing a high-quality surrogate model often demands extensive data acquisition. A solution to this issue is to transfer pre-trained surrogate models for new tasks, provided that certain invariances exist between tasks. This study focuses on transferring non-differentiable surrogate models (e.g., random forests) from a source function to a target function, where we assume their domains are related by an unknown affine transformation, using only a limited amount of transfer data points evaluated on the target. Previous research attempts to tackle this challenge for differentiable models, e.g., Gaussian process regression, which minimizes the empirical loss on the transfer data by tuning the affine transformations. In this paper, we extend the previous work to the random forest and assess its effectiveness on a widely-used artificial problem set - Black-Box Optimization Benchmark (BBOB) testbed, and on four real-world transfer learning problems. The results highlight the significant practical advantages of the proposed method, particularly in reducing both the data requirements and computational costs of training surrogate models for complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a decentralized paradigm to train models while preserving privacy. However, conventional FL struggles with data heterogeneity and class imbalance, which degrade model performance. Clustered FL balances personalization and decentralized training by grouping clients with analogous data distributions, enabling improved accuracy while adhering to privacy constraints. This approach effectively mitigates the adverse impact of heterogeneity in FL. In this work, we propose a novel clustered FL method, FedGWC (Federated Gaussian Weighting Clustering), which groups clients based on their data distribution, allowing training of a more robust and personalized model on the identified clusters. FedGWC identifies homogeneous clusters by transforming individual empirical losses to model client interactions with a Gaussian reward mechanism. Additionally, we introduce the Wasserstein Adjusted Score, a new clustering metric for FL to evaluate cluster cohesion with respect to the individual class distribution. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that FedGWC outperforms existing FL algorithms in cluster quality and classification accuracy, validating the efficacy of our approach.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical constraints into deep learning models. However, standard PINNs often require a large number of training samples to achieve high accuracy, leading to increased computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Active Learning-Driven PINNs (AL-PINN), which integrates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Active Learning (AL) strategies to optimize sample selection dynamically.
  AL-PINN utilizes Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate epistemic uncertainty in the model predictions, enabling the adaptive selection of high-uncertainty regions for additional training. This approach significantly enhances learning efficiency by focusing computational resources on the most informative data points. We evaluate AL-PINN on benchmark PDE problems with known analytical solutions and real-world WeatherBench climate data. Our results demonstrate that AL-PINN achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to traditional PINNs while reducing the number of required training samples.
  The proposed framework is particularly beneficial for scientific and engineering applications where data collection is expensive or limited, such as climate modeling, medical simulations, and material science. Our findings highlight the potential of active learning in accelerating PINN-based PDE solvers while maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural network training. However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics.
  To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs.
  This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in proving formal theorems using proof assistants like Lean. However, current state of the art language models struggles to predict next step in proofs leading practitioners to use different sampling techniques to improve LLMs capabilities. We observe that the LLM is capable of predicting the correct tactic; however, it faces challenges in ranking it appropriately within the set of candidate tactics, affecting the overall selection process. To overcome this hurdle, we use activation steering to guide LLMs responses to improve the generations at the time of inference. Our results suggest that activation steering offers a promising lightweight alternative to specialized fine-tuning for enhancing theorem proving capabilities in LLMs, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In combinatorial semi-bandits, a learner repeatedly selects from a combinatorial decision set of arms, receives the realized sum of rewards, and observes the rewards of the individual selected arms as feedback. In this paper, we extend this framework to include \emph{graph feedback}, where the learner observes the rewards of all neighboring arms of the selected arms in a feedback graph $G$. We establish that the optimal regret over a time horizon $T$ scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(S\sqrt{T}+\sqrt{\alpha ST})$, where $S$ is the size of the combinatorial decisions and $\alpha$ is the independence number of $G$. This result interpolates between the known regrets $\widetilde\Theta(S\sqrt{T})$ under full information (i.e., $G$ is complete) and $\widetilde\Theta(\sqrt{KST})$ under the semi-bandit feedback (i.e., $G$ has only self-loops), where $K$ is the total number of arms. A key technical ingredient is to realize a convexified action using a random decision vector with negative correlations. We also show that online stochastic mirror descent (OSMD) that only realizes convexified actions in expectation is suboptimal.

Abstract: Dynamic emotion recognition in the wild remains challenging due to the transient nature of emotional expressions and temporal misalignment of multi-modal cues. Traditional approaches predict valence and arousal and often overlook the inherent correlation between these two dimensions. The proposed Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network (MAVEN) integrates visual, audio, and textual modalities through a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism. MAVEN uses modality-specific encoders to extract features from synchronized video frames, audio segments, and transcripts, predicting emotions in polar coordinates following Russell's circumplex model. The evaluation of the Aff-Wild2 dataset using MAVEN achieved a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.3061, surpassing the ResNet-50 baseline model with a CCC of 0.22. The multistage architecture captures the subtle and transient nature of emotional expressions in conversational videos and improves emotion recognition in real-world situations.

<title>DConAD: A Differencing-based Contrastive Representation Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection holds notable importance for risk identification and fault detection across diverse application domains. Unsupervised learning methods have become popular because they have no requirement for labels. However, due to the challenges posed by the multiplicity of abnormal patterns, the sparsity of anomalies, and the growth of data scale and complexity, these methods often fail to capture robust and representative dependencies within the time series for identifying anomalies. To enhance the ability of models to capture normal patterns of time series and avoid the retrogression of modeling ability triggered by the dependencies on high-quality prior knowledge, we propose a differencing-based contrastive representation learning framework for time series anomaly detection (DConAD). Specifically, DConAD generates differential data to provide additional information about time series and utilizes transformer-based architecture to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, which enhances the robustness of unbiased representation learning ability. Furthermore, DConAD implements a novel KL divergence-based contrastive learning paradigm that only uses positive samples to avoid deviation from reconstruction and deploys the stop-gradient strategy to compel convergence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets show the superiority and effectiveness of DConAD compared with nine baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/shaieesss/DConAD.

Abstract: This paper presents an automated one-shot bird call classification pipeline designed for rare species absent from large publicly available classifiers like BirdNET and Perch. While these models excel at detecting common birds with abundant training data, they lack options for species with only 1-3 known recordings-a critical limitation for conservationists monitoring the last remaining individuals of endangered birds. To address this, we leverage the embedding space of large bird classification networks and develop a classifier using cosine similarity, combined with filtering and denoising preprocessing techniques, to optimize detection with minimal training data. We evaluate various embedding spaces using clustering metrics and validate our approach in both a simulated scenario with Xeno-Canto recordings and a real-world test on the critically endangered tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris), which has no existing classifiers and only three confirmed recordings. The final model achieved 1.0 recall and 0.95 accuracy in detecting tooth-billed pigeon calls, making it practical for use in the field. This open-source system provides a practical tool for conservationists seeking to detect and monitor rare species on the brink of extinction.

Abstract: The set of local modes and density ridge lines are important summary characteristics of the data-generating distribution. In this work, we focus on estimating local modes and density ridges from point cloud data in a product space combining two or more Euclidean and/or directional metric spaces. Specifically, our approach extends the (subspace constrained) mean shift algorithm to such product spaces, addressing potential challenges in the generalization process. We establish the algorithmic convergence of the proposed methods, along with practical implementation guidelines.

Abstract: The proximal stochastic gradient method (PSGD) is one of the state-of-the-art approaches for stochastic composite-type problems. In contrast to its deterministic counterpart, PSGD has been found to have difficulties with the correct identification of underlying substructures (such as supports, low rank patterns, or active constraints) and it does not possess a finite-time manifold identification property. Existing solutions rely on convexity assumptions or on the additional usage of variance reduction techniques. In this paper, we address these limitations and present a simple variant of PSGD based on Robinson's normal map. The proposed normal map-based proximal stochastic gradient method (NSGD) is shown to converge globally, i.e., accumulation points of the generated iterates correspond to stationary points almost surely. In addition, we establish complexity bounds for NSGD that match the known results for PSGD and we prove that NSGD can almost surely identify active manifolds in finite-time in a general nonconvex setting. Our derivations are built on almost sure iterate convergence guarantees and utilize analysis techniques based on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality.

Abstract: Graphical models have exhibited their performance in numerous tasks ranging from biological analysis to recommender systems. However, graphical models with hub nodes are computationally difficult to fit, particularly when the dimension of the data is large. To efficiently estimate the hub graphical models, we introduce a two-phase algorithm. The proposed algorithm first generates a good initial point via a dual alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then warm starts a semismooth Newton (SSN) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to compute a solution that is accurate enough for practical tasks. We fully excavate the sparsity structure of the generalized Jacobian arising from the hubs in the graphical models, which ensures that the algorithm can obtain a nice solution very efficiently. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic data and real data show that it obviously outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, in some high dimensional tasks, it can save more than 70\% of the execution time, meanwhile still achieves a high-quality estimation.

Abstract: Recent developments in domains such as non-local games, quantum interactive proofs, and quantum generative adversarial networks have renewed interest in quantum game theory and, specifically, quantum zero-sum games. Central to classical game theory is the efficient algorithmic computation of Nash equilibria, which represent optimal strategies for both players. In 2008, Jain and Watrous proposed the first classical algorithm for computing equilibria in quantum zero-sum games using the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Updates (MMWU) method to achieve a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon^2)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in the $4^d$-dimensional spectraplex. In this work, we propose a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize MMWU via an extra-gradient mechanism. Notably, within this proposed hierarchy, we introduce the Optimistic Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update (OMMWU) algorithm and establish its average-iterate convergence complexity as $\mathcal{O}(d/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. This quadratic speed-up relative to Jain and Watrous' original algorithm sets a new benchmark for computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in quantum zero-sum games.

Abstract: Multivariate density estimation is of great interest in various scientific and engineering disciplines. In this work, we introduce a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS), specifically designed to estimate multivariate density functions with a reduced curse of dimensionality. Our VRS framework conceptualizes multivariate functions as infinite-size matrices/tensors, and facilitates a new sketching technique motivated by the numerical linear algebra literature to reduce the variance in density estimation problems. We demonstrate the robust numerical performance of VRS through a series of simulated experiments and real-world data applications. Notably, VRS shows remarkable improvement over existing neural network density estimators and classical kernel methods in numerous distribution models. Additionally, we offer theoretical justifications for VRS to support its ability to deliver density estimation with a reduced curse of dimensionality.

Abstract: Financial cluster analysis allows investors to discover investment alternatives and avoid undertaking excessive risks. However, this analytical task faces substantial challenges arising from many pairwise comparisons, the dynamic correlations across time spans, and the ambiguity in deriving implications from business relational knowledge. We propose Prismatic, a visual analytics system that integrates quantitative analysis of historical performance and qualitative analysis of business relational knowledge to cluster correlated businesses interactively. Prismatic features three clustering processes: dynamic cluster generation, knowledge-based cluster exploration, and correlation-based cluster validation. Utilizing a multi-view clustering approach, it enriches data-driven clusters with knowledge-driven similarity, providing a nuanced understanding of business correlations. Through well-coordinated visual views, Prismatic facilitates a comprehensive interpretation of intertwined quantitative and qualitative features, demonstrating its usefulness and effectiveness via case studies on formulating concept stocks and extensive interviews with domain experts.

Abstract: Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is essential for task adaptation, yet serving stacks today isolate inference and finetuning on separate GPU clusters -- wasting resources and under-utilizing hardware. We introduce FlexLLM, the first system to co-serve LLM inference and PEFT-based finetuning on shared GPUs by fusing computation at the token level. The static compilation optimizations in FlexLLM -- dependent parallelization and graph pruning significantly shrink activation memory, leading to end-to-end GPU memory savings by up to 80%. At runtime, a novel token-level finetuning mechanism paired with a hybrid token scheduler dynamically interleaves inference and training tokens within each co-serving iteration, meeting strict latency SLOs while maximizing utilization. In end-to-end benchmarks on LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, FlexLLM sustains the inference SLO requirements up to 20 req/s, and improves finetuning throughput by 1.9-4.8x under heavy inference workloads and 2.5-6.8x under light loads, preserving over 76% of peak finetuning progress even at peak demand. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow/.

Abstract: Holography stands at the forefront of visual technology, offering immersive, three-dimensional visualizations through the manipulation of light wave amplitude and phase. Although generative models have been extensively explored in the image domain, their application to holograms remains relatively underexplored due to the inherent complexity of phase learning. Exploiting generative models for holograms offers exciting opportunities for advancing innovation and creativity, such as semantic-aware hologram generation and editing. Currently, the most viable approach for utilizing generative models in the hologram domain involves integrating an image-based generative model with an image-to-hologram conversion model, which comes at the cost of increased computational complexity and inefficiency. To tackle this problem, we introduce P-Hologen, the first end-to-end generative framework designed for phase-only holograms (POHs). P-Hologen employs vector quantized variational autoencoders to capture the complex distributions of POHs. It also integrates the angular spectrum method into the training process, constructing latent spaces for complex phase data using strategies from the image processing domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that P-Hologen achieves superior quality and computational efficiency compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, our model generates high-quality unseen, diverse holographic content from its learned latent space without requiring pre-existing images. Our work paves the way for new applications and methodologies in holographic content creation, opening a new era in the exploration of generative holographic content. The code for our paper is publicly available on https://github.com/james0223/P-Hologen.

<title>Do Vision &amp; Language Decoders use Images and Text equally? How Self-consistent are their Explanations?</title>

Abstract: Vision and language model (VLM) decoders are currently the best-performing architectures on multimodal tasks. Next to answers, they are able to produce natural language explanations, either in post-hoc or CoT settings. However, it is not clear to what extent they are using the input vision and text modalities when generating answers or explanations. In this work, we investigate if VLMs rely on their input modalities differently when they produce explanations as opposed to answers. We also evaluate the self-consistency of VLM decoders in both post-hoc and CoT explanation settings, by extending existing unimodal tests and measures to VLM decoders. We find that most tested VLMs are less self-consistent than LLMs. Text contributions in all tested VL decoders are more important than image contributions in all examined tasks. However, when comparing explanation generation to answer generation, the contributions of images are significantly stronger for generating explanations compared to answers. This difference is even larger in CoT compared to post-hoc explanations. Lastly, we provide an up-to-date benchmarking of state-of-the-art VL decoders on the VALSE benchmark, which before was restricted to VL encoders. We find that the tested VL decoders still struggle with most phenomena tested by VALSE.

Abstract: Buildings account for 40% of global energy consumption. A considerable portion of building energy consumption stems from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and thus implementing smart, energy-efficient HVAC systems has the potential to significantly impact the course of climate change. In recent years, model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been increasingly assessed for this purpose due to their ability to learn and adapt purely from experience. They have been shown to outperform classical controllers in terms of energy cost and consumption, as well as thermal comfort. However, their weakness lies in their relatively poor data efficiency, requiring long periods of training to reach acceptable policies, making them inapplicable to real-world controllers directly. In this paper, we demonstrate that using federated learning to train the reinforcement learning controller of HVAC systems can improve the learning speed, as well as improve their ability to generalize, which in turn facilitates transfer learning to unseen building environments. In our setting, a global control policy is learned by aggregating local policies trained on multiple data centers located in different climate zones. The goal of the policy is to minimize energy consumption and maximize thermal comfort. We perform experiments evaluating three different optimizers for local policy training, as well as three different federated learning algorithms against two alternative baselines. Our experiments show that these effects lead to a faster learning speed, as well as greater generalization capabilities in the federated policy compared to any individually trained policy. Furthermore, the learning stability is significantly improved, with the learning process and performance of the federated policy being less sensitive to the choice of parameters and the inherent randomness of reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This paper shows that dimensionality reduction methods such as UMAP and t-SNE, can be approximately recast as MAP inference methods corresponding to a model introduced in Ravuri et al. (2023), that describes the graph Laplacian (an estimate of the data precision matrix) using a Wishart distribution, with a mean given by a non-linear covariance function evaluated on the latents. This interpretation offers deeper theoretical and semantic insights into such algorithms, and forging a connection to Gaussian process latent variable models by showing that well-known kernels can be used to describe covariances implied by graph Laplacians. We also introduce tools with which similar dimensionality reduction methods can be studied.

Inspired by the success of generative diffusion models, we propose a novel approach of coupling data mollification, in the form of image noising and blurring, with label smoothing to align predicted label confidences with image degradation. The method is simple to implement, introduces negligible overheads, and can be combined with existing augmentations. We demonstrate improved robustness and uncertainty quantification on the corrupted image benchmarks of CIFAR, TinyImageNet and ImageNet datasets.

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) addresses many important problems, including the challenging Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Alongside exact and heuristic solvers, differentiable approaches have emerged, often using continuous relaxations of ReLU-based or quadratic objectives. Noting that an MIS in a graph is a Maximum Clique (MC) in its complement, we propose a new quadratic formulation for MIS by incorporating an MC term, improving convergence and exploration. We show that every maximal independent set corresponds to a local minimizer, derive conditions with respect to the MIS size, and characterize stationary points. To tackle the non-convexity of the objective, we propose optimizing several initializations in parallel using momentum-based gradient descent, complemented by an efficient MIS checking criterion derived from our theory. We dub our method as **p**arallelized **C**lique-Informed **Q**uadratic **O**ptimization for MIS (**pCQO-MIS**). Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to exact, heuristic, sampling, and data-centric approaches. Notably, our method avoids the out-of-distribution tuning and reliance on (un)labeled data required by data-centric methods, while achieving superior MIS sizes and competitive runtime relative to their inference time. Additionally, a key advantage of pCQO-MIS is that, unlike exact and heuristic solvers, the runtime scales only with the number of nodes in the graph, not the number of edges. Our code is available at the GitHub repository \href{https://github.com/ledenmat/pCQO-mis-benchmark/tree/refactor}{{{pCQO-MIS}}}

arXiv:2409.07769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.

<title>Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems</title>

Abstract: Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error at convergence.

Abstract: Neal (1996) proved that infinitely wide shallow Bayesian neural networks (BNN) converge to Gaussian processes (GP), when the network weights have bounded prior variance. Cho & Saul (2009) provided a useful recursive formula for deep kernel processes for relating the covariance kernel of each layer to the layer immediately below. Moreover, they worked out the form of the layer-wise covariance kernel in an explicit manner for several common activation functions. Recent works, including Aitchison et al. (2021), have highlighted that the covariance kernels obtained in this manner are deterministic and hence, precludes any possibility of representation learning, which amounts to learning a non-degenerate posterior of a random kernel given the data. To address this, they propose adding artificial noise to the kernel to retain stochasticity, and develop deep kernel inverse Wishart processes. Nonetheless, this artificial noise injection could be critiqued in that it would not naturally emerge in a classic BNN architecture under an infinite-width limit. To address this, we show that a Bayesian deep neural network, where each layer width approaches infinity, and all network weights are elliptically distributed with infinite variance, converges to a process with $\alpha$-stable marginals in each layer that has a conditionally Gaussian representation. These conditional random covariance kernels could be recursively linked in the manner of Cho & Saul (2009), even though marginally the process exhibits stable behavior, and hence covariances are not even necessarily defined. We also provide useful generalizations of the recent results of Lor\'ia & Bhadra (2024) on shallow networks to multi-layer networks, and remedy the computational burden of their approach. The computational and statistical benefits over competing approaches stand out in simulations and in demonstrations on benchmark data sets.

Abstract: In the endeavor to make autonomous robots take actions, task planning is a major challenge that requires translating high-level task descriptions to long-horizon action sequences. Despite recent advances in language model agents, they remain prone to planning errors and limited in their ability to plan ahead. To address these limitations in robotic planning, we advocate a self-refining scheme that iteratively refines a draft plan until an equilibrium is reached. Remarkably, this process can be optimized end-to-end from an analytical perspective without the need to curate additional verifiers or reward models, allowing us to train self-refining planners in a simple supervised learning fashion. Meanwhile, a nested equilibrium sequence modeling procedure is devised for efficient closed-loop planning that incorporates useful feedback from the environment (or an internal world model). Our method is evaluated on the VirtualHome-Env benchmark, showing advanced performance with improved scaling w.r.t. inference-time computation. Code is available at https://github.com/Singularity0104/equilibrium-planner.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation is a crucial and useful technology for virtual human interaction and film-making. While recent advances have focused on improving image fidelity and lip synchronization, generating accurate emotional expressions remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce EmoGene, a novel framework for synthesizing high-fidelity, audio-driven video portraits with accurate emotional expressions. Our approach employs a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based audio-to-motion module to generate facial landmarks, which are concatenated with emotional embedding in a motion-to-emotion module to produce emotional landmarks. These landmarks drive a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based emotion-to-video module to render realistic emotional talking-head videos. Additionally, we propose a pose sampling method to generate natural idle-state (non-speaking) videos for silent audio inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoGene outperforms previous methods in generating high-fidelity emotional talking-head videos.

Abstract: Designing quantum circuits for specific tasks is challenging due to the exponential growth of the state space. We introduce gadget reinforcement learning (GRL), which integrates reinforcement learning with program synthesis to automatically generate and incorporate composite gates (gadgets) into the action space. This enhances the exploration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) for complex tasks like approximating ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, an NP-hard problem. We evaluate GRL using the transverse field Ising model under typical computational budgets (e.g., 2- 3 days of GPU runtime). Our results show improved accuracy, hardware compatibility and scalability. GRL exhibits robust performance as the size and complexity of the problem increases, even with constrained computational resources. By integrating gadget extraction, GRL facilitates the discovery of reusable circuit components tailored for specific hardware, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and practical implementation. This makes GRL a versatile framework for optimizing quantum circuits with applications in hardware-specific optimizations and variational quantum algorithms.

arXiv:2411.12150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with environmental constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different components in the environment and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal (st) graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous st-graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions among entities through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success and efficiency in challenging navigation scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our pipeline achieves better zero-shot generalization capability than previous works when the densities of humans and obstacles change.

Abstract: Non-equilibrium Markov Chain Monte Carlo (NE-MCMC) simulations provide a well-understood framework based on Jarzynski's equality to sample from a target probability distribution. By driving a base probability distribution out of equilibrium, observables are computed without the need to thermalize. If the base distribution is characterized by mild autocorrelations, this approach provides a way to mitigate critical slowing down. Out-of-equilibrium evolutions share the same framework of flow-based approaches and they can be naturally combined into a novel architecture called Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNFs). In this work we present the first implementation of SNFs for $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory in 4 dimensions, defined by introducing gauge-equivariant layers between out-of-equilibrium Monte Carlo updates. The core of our analysis is focused on the promising scaling properties of this architecture with the degrees of freedom of the system, which are directly inherited from NE-MCMC. Finally, we discuss how systematic improvements of this approach can realistically lead to a general and yet efficient sampling strategy at fine lattice spacings for observables affected by long autocorrelation times.

Abstract: Traditional greedy tokenization methods have been a critical step in Natural Language Processing (NLP), influencing how text is converted into tokens and directly impacting model performance. While subword tokenizers like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely used, questions remain about their optimality across model scales and languages. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive experiments that an optimal BPE configuration significantly reduces token count compared to greedy segmentation, yielding improvements in token-saving percentages and performance benefits, particularly for smaller models. We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.

Abstract: Do generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, trained only to predict the next token, implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We address this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for input sequences and present a confidence score. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled environment using the setup and rules of the Othello and Chess strategy games. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on out-of-distribution synthetic data consisting of sequences of random legal moves. We find that the GPT model is likely to generate legal next moves for out-of-distribution sequences for which a causal structure is encoded in the attention mechanism with high confidence. In cases for which the GPT model generates illegal moves it also fails to capture any causal structure.

arXiv:2501.00070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy "graph tracing" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces an information-theoretic framework for text summarization. We define the summarizer rate-distortion function and show that it provides a fundamental lower bound on summarizer performance. We describe an iterative procedure, similar to Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, for computing this function. To handle real-world text datasets, we also propose a practical method that can calculate the summarizer rate-distortion function with limited data. Finally, we empirically confirm our theoretical results by comparing the summarizer rate-distortion function with the performances of different summarizers used in practice.

Abstract: As probabilistic models continue to permeate various facets of our society and contribute to scientific advancements, it becomes a necessity to go beyond traditional metrics such as predictive accuracy and error rates and assess their trustworthiness. Grounded in the competence-based theory of trust, this work formalizes I-trustworthy framework -- a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of probabilistic classifiers for inference tasks by linking local calibration to trustworthiness. To assess I-trustworthiness, we use the local calibration error (LCE) and develop a method of hypothesis-testing. This method utilizes a kernel-based test statistic, Kernel Local Calibration Error (KLCE), to test local calibration of a probabilistic classifier. This study provides theoretical guarantees by offering convergence bounds for an unbiased estimator of KLCE. Additionally, we present a diagnostic tool designed to identify and measure biases in cases of miscalibration. The effectiveness of the proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application to both simulated and real-world datasets. Finally, LCE of related recalibration methods is studied, and we provide evidence of insufficiency of existing methods to achieve I-trustworthiness.

<title>From Foresight to Forethought: VLM-In-the-Loop Policy Steering via Latent Alignment</title>

arXiv:2502.01828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While generative robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in learning complex, multimodal behaviors from demonstrations, they still exhibit diverse failures at deployment-time. Policy steering offers an elegant solution to reducing the chance of failure by using an external verifier to select from low-level actions proposed by an imperfect generative policy. Here, one might hope to use a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a verifier, leveraging its open-world reasoning capabilities. However, off-the-shelf VLMs struggle to understand the consequences of low-level robot actions as they are represented fundamentally differently than the text and images the VLM was trained on. In response, we propose FOREWARN, a novel framework to unlock the potential of VLMs as open-vocabulary verifiers for runtime policy steering. Our key idea is to decouple the VLM's burden of predicting action outcomes (foresight) from evaluation (forethought). For foresight, we leverage a latent world model to imagine future latent states given diverse low-level action plans. For forethought, we align the VLM with these predicted latent states to reason about the consequences of actions in its native representation--natural language--and effectively filter proposed plans. We validate our framework across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating its ability to bridge representational gaps and provide robust, generalizable policy steering.

arXiv:2502.01976v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks but suffer from high computational costs during inference, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Inference with Token-lEvel Routing (CITER) framework that enables efficient collaboration between small and large language models (SLMs \& LLMs) through a token-level routing strategy. Specifically, CITER routes non-critical tokens to an SLM for efficiency and routes critical tokens to an LLM for generalization quality. We formulate router training as a policy optimization, where the router receives rewards based on both the quality of predictions and the inference costs of generation. This allows the router to learn to predict token-level routing scores and make routing decisions based on both the current token and the future impact of its decisions. To further accelerate the reward evaluation process, we introduce a shortcut which significantly reduces the costs of the reward estimation and improving the practicality of our approach. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that CITER reduces the inference costs while preserving high-quality generation, offering a promising solution for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/CITER.

<title>Rethinking Latent Redundancy in Behavior Cloning: An Information Bottleneck Approach for Robot Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a widely adopted visual imitation learning method in robot manipulation. Current BC approaches often enhance generalization by leveraging large datasets and incorporating additional visual and textual modalities to capture more diverse information. However, these methods overlook whether the learned representations contain redundant information and lack a solid theoretical foundation to guide the learning process. To address these limitations, we adopt an information-theoretic perspective and introduce mutual information to quantify and mitigate redundancy in latent representations. Building on this, we incorporate the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle into BC, which extends the idea of reducing redundancy by providing a structured framework for compressing irrelevant information while preserving task-relevant features. This work presents the first comprehensive study on redundancy in latent representations across various methods, backbones, and experimental settings, while extending the generalizability of the IB to BC. Extensive experiments and analyses on the CortexBench and LIBERO benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements with IB, underscoring the importance of reducing input data redundancy and highlighting its practical value for more practical applications.

Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.

Abstract: Bathymetry, the study of underwater topography, relies on sonar mapping of submerged structures. These measurements, critical for infrastructure health monitoring, often require expensive instrumentation. The high financial risk associated with sensor damage or vessel loss creates a reluctance to deploy uncrewed surface vessels (USVs) for bathymetry. However, the crewed-boat bathymetry operations, are costly, pose hazards to personnel, and frequently fail to achieve the stable conditions necessary for bathymetry data collection, especially under high currents. Further research is essential to advance autonomous control, navigation, and data processing technologies, with a particular focus on bathymetry. There is a notable lack of accessible hardware platforms that allow for integrated research in both bathymetry-focused autonomous control and navigation, as well as data evaluation and processing. This paper addresses this gap through the design and implementation of two complementary USV systems tailored for uncrewed bathymetry research. This includes a low-cost USV for Navigation And Control research (NAC-USV) and a second, high-end USV equipped with a high-resolution multi-beam sonar and the associated hardware for Bathymetry data quality Evaluation and Post-processing research (BEP-USV). The NAC-USV facilitates the investigation of autonomous, fail-safe navigation and control, emphasizing the stability requirements for high-quality bathymetry data collection while minimizing the risk to equipment. The BEP-USV, which mirrors the NAC-USV hardware, is then used for additional control validation and in-depth exploration of bathymetry data evaluation and post-processing methodologies. We detail the design and implementation of both systems, and open source the design. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in a range of operational scenarios.

<title>RestoreGrad: Signal Restoration Using Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models with Jointly Learned Prior</title>

arXiv:2502.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be utilized for recovering a clean signal from its degraded observation(s) by conditioning the model on the degraded signal. The degraded signals are themselves contaminated versions of the clean signals; due to this correlation, they may encompass certain useful information about the target clean data distribution. However, existing adoption of the standard Gaussian as the prior distribution in turn discards such information, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose to improve conditional DDPMs for signal restoration by leveraging a more informative prior that is jointly learned with the diffusion model. The proposed framework, called RestoreGrad, seamlessly integrates DDPMs into the variational autoencoder framework and exploits the correlation between the degraded and clean signals to encode a better diffusion prior. On speech and image restoration tasks, we show that RestoreGrad demonstrates faster convergence (5-10 times fewer training steps) to achieve better quality of restored signals over existing DDPM baselines, and improved robustness to using fewer sampling steps in inference time (2-2.5 times fewer), advocating the advantages of leveraging jointly learned prior for efficiency improvements in the diffusion process.

Abstract: Soybean leaf disease detection is critical for agricultural productivity but faces challenges due to visually similar symptoms and limited interpretability in conventional methods. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in spatial feature extraction, they often neglect inter-image relational dependencies, leading to misclassifications. This paper proposes an interpretable hybrid Sequential CNN-Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that synergizes MobileNetV2 for localized feature extraction and GraphSAGE for relational modeling. The framework constructs a graph where nodes represent leaf images, with edges defined by cosine similarity-based adjacency matrices and adaptive neighborhood sampling. This design captures fine-grained lesion features and global symptom patterns, addressing inter-class similarity challenges. Cross-modal interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM and Eigen-CAM visualizations, generating heatmaps to highlight disease-influential regions. Evaluated on a dataset of ten soybean leaf diseases, the model achieves $97.16\%$ accuracy, surpassing standalone CNNs ($\le95.04\%$) and traditional machine learning models ($\le77.05\%$). Ablation studies validate the sequential architecture's superiority over parallel or single-model configurations. With only 2.3 million parameters, the lightweight MobileNetV2-GraphSAGE combination ensures computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. The proposed approach bridges the gap between accurate classification and practical applicability, offering a robust, interpretable tool for agricultural diagnostics while advancing CNN-GNN integration in plant pathology research.

Abstract: This paper presents ArticuBot, in which a single learned policy enables a robotics system to open diverse categories of unseen articulated objects in the real world. This task has long been challenging for robotics due to the large variations in the geometry, size, and articulation types of such objects. Our system, Articubot, consists of three parts: generating a large number of demonstrations in physics-based simulation, distilling all generated demonstrations into a point cloud-based neural policy via imitation learning, and performing zero-shot sim2real transfer to real robotics systems. Utilizing sampling-based grasping and motion planning, our demonstration generalization pipeline is fast and effective, generating a total of 42.3k demonstrations over 322 training articulated objects. For policy learning, we propose a novel hierarchical policy representation, in which the high-level policy learns the sub-goal for the end-effector, and the low-level policy learns how to move the end-effector conditioned on the predicted goal. We demonstrate that this hierarchical approach achieves much better object-level generalization compared to the non-hierarchical version. We further propose a novel weighted displacement model for the high-level policy that grounds the prediction into the existing 3D structure of the scene, outperforming alternative policy representations. We show that our learned policy can zero-shot transfer to three different real robot settings: a fixed table-top Franka arm across two different labs, and an X-Arm on a mobile base, opening multiple unseen articulated objects across two labs, real lounges, and kitchens.

Abstract: Federated learning leverages data across institutions to improve clinical discovery while complying with data-sharing restrictions and protecting patient privacy. As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have the same impact in bioinformatics, allowing access to many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks. This paper reviews the methodological, infrastructural and legal issues that academic and clinical institutions must address before implementing it. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of federated learning and its effective translation into clinical practice.

<br />
Summary: <br /> 
The paper explores the impact of data sampling on the reliability of fairness metrics in machine learning models. It introduces FairMatch, a post-processing method that uses propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias in test data. By identifying control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores and adjusting decision thresholds for different subgroups, FairMatch locates unbiased subsets and reduces bias in the remaining data. The approach also includes probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions for unmatched samples. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FairMatch in improving fairness evaluation and mitigation without sacrificing predictive performance. <div>

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.

<div> Keywords: Satellite-based estimates, greenhouse gas properties, Optimal Estimation, uncertainty quantification, diffusion-based approach

Summary: 
Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas properties play a crucial role in understanding and monitoring terrestrial systems and the carbon cycle. Retrieval of GHG concentrations from solar spectra observations is a challenging non-linear Bayesian inverse problem solved using the computationally expensive Optimal Estimation (OE) algorithm. However, the current method leads to convergence issues and overly confident uncertainty estimates. The upcoming satellite missions will generate significantly more data, necessitating fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification. To address this, a diffusion-based approach is proposed to retrieve Gaussian or non-Gaussian posteriors for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, offering a substantial computational speed-up compared to current approaches. This advancement is crucial for achieving near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks, essential for informing policy decisions.

Abstract: Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$) trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust, sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and recreational fitness enthusiasts.

<div> Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density Filter, Ensemble, Kernel-Based, Multi-Target, Filtering <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (EnGM-PHD) filter for multi-target filtering applications. This filter combines Gaussian mixture techniques from the GM-PHD filter with particle-based methods from the SMC-PHD filter. By utilizing Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to approximate the prior intensity function, the EnGM-PHD filter ensures convergence to the true intensity function as the number of components increases. In scenarios with a single target and no additional complexities, the EnGM-PHD filter simplifies to the Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). Experimental results demonstrate that the EnGM-PHD filter outperforms both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters in multi-target filtering while using the same number of components or particles. This innovative approach shows promising potential for enhancing multi-target tracking performance in various applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications. The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births, deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters while using the same number of components or particles.

<div> Keywords: Python, asynchronous runtime, Gaussian process, scalability, performance 

Summary: 
Python is widely used in AI software development, with libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow leveraging built-in parallelization for speedup on CPUs. However, performance issues may arise when only using low-level parallelization. This study introduces a novel approach of integrating task-based C++ code using the HPX asynchronous runtime model into Python via pybind11. A parallel Gaussian process (GP) library, GPRat, was developed to combine the ease of use of existing GP libraries with the scalability and performance of asynchronous runtimes. Performance evaluation on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrated minimal overhead when binding the HPX code with pybind11. GPRat outperformed GPyTorch and GPflow in terms of scalability on training tasks, with significant prediction speedups. These findings highlight the potential of employing asynchronous tasks in Python-based AI applications.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process (GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19, respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks within Python-based AI applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces the bi-fidelity stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a zeroth-order optimization method that leverages a bi-fidelity framework to reduce computational burden. By combining low-fidelity and high-fidelity function evaluations, BF-SSD constructs a surrogate model that allows for efficient step size selection through backtracking line search. The algorithm is supported by theoretical convergence guarantees and is evaluated across various problems, showcasing superior optimization performance while requiring fewer high-fidelity function evaluations compared to baseline methods.

arXiv:2505.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale, high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

This study introduces an interpretable deep learning framework for predicting recurrence in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). By incorporating vector embeddings for categorical variables like smoking status and treatment history, the model can capture complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy. The framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving 70% accuracy with tabular data. Additionally, it provides clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting influential features through attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the model identifies new factors affecting recurrence risk, such as surgical duration and hospital stay, which were not previously considered in NMIBC prediction models.

arXiv:2505.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However, existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction models.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN), Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation, followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and the need for advanced computational techniques in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic diseases.

Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) utilize dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural networks at scale. However, they are computationally expensive, especially when multiple SAEs of different sizes are required. This study reveals that dictionary importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. A comparison is made between progressive coding through subset pruning of SAEs and training nested SAEs known as Matryoshka SAEs on a language modeling task. Matryoshka SAEs demonstrate lower reconstruction and recaptured language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. On the other hand, pruned vanilla SAEs are more interpretable. The trade-off between interpretability and performance in these approaches is discussed, shedding light on the origins and implications of this phenomenon. <br />

SAEs are, however, computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs \citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however.

Our study introduces a novel manifold learning framework for capturing subject-specific spatial variations in neuroimaging data. The framework shows superior performance on simulated and real fMRI datasets compared to group-based methods. It can efficiently scale to large datasets and generalize well to new subjects. Application of the framework to resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls reveals clinically relevant brain activity patterns. These patterns include increased activation in regions such as the basal ganglia and visual areas, as well as decreased activation in regions like the insula and angular gyrus. The individualized spatial maps generated by our model offer valuable insights for computational neuroscience and clinical research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in computational neuroscience and clinical research.

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary, offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting, which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning'' algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this natural problem still being largely unexplored.

<div> Transformer model, outage prediction, Customer Satisfaction Impact, interpretability techniques, utility providers <br />
<br />
Summary: The study proposes a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model to enhance Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) predictions during natural disasters. Traditional methods often lack precision, making it challenging for utility providers to communicate reliable ETRs to customers. The LTT model, utilizing historical outage data and sequential updates, significantly improves Customer Satisfaction Impact by 19.08% compared to existing methods. The model incorporates customer-informed regression metrics to align with real-world satisfaction levels. Interpretability techniques are employed to analyze the importance of sequential updates in predicting outage events and to identify key predictive features influencing ETRs. Overall, the LTT model not only enhances predictive accuracy but also promotes transparency and trust in the model's capabilities, crucial for utility providers in efficiently managing power outages during severe weather conditions. <div>

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions. Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a 2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency, fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Summary: 
The article explores a novel approach to enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks by leveraging in-context learning from their own successful experiences. Instead of relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, the focus is on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. The study demonstrates that simple accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks significantly boosts test performance on three benchmarks. The approach eliminates the need for labor-intensive knowledge engineering and showcases the potential of automatic trajectory database construction in improving agent performance.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%), and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving 91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value. A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next, the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic information.

The proposed method involves dividing the heterogeneous business data into subgraphs and constructing a statistically heterogeneous global graph for sharing and circulation through a central server.

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence speed than existing methods.

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the over-simplification in WCM.

By using policies from neural networks trained on match data, alongside strength scores, the method improves strength estimation accuracy in Go and chess.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals, strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches, the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account. Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20 matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength estimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the development of AI-driven technologies.

Summary:
Recurrent Graph Neural Networks with sum aggregation and ReLU activation have tight bounds on expressivity with finite-precision parameters. They can mimic any graph algorithm respecting the message-passing invariance of the color refinement algorithm, reaching the expressive power limit unlike non-recurrent GNNs. Incorporating random initialization enables recurrent GNNs to emulate all graph algorithms, indicating that any polynomial-time complexity graph algorithm can be emulated by a recurrent GNN with random initialization, running in polynomial time. <div>
arXiv:2505.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI 2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes. Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures. Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore, TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

<div> Sparse Attention, Large Language Models, Mixture of Sparse Attention, Computational Complexity, Self-Attention <br />
<br />
Summary: Recent research on large language models has highlighted the computational inefficiency of self-attention mechanisms due to their quadratic complexity. In response, a new approach called Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA) has been introduced, inspired by the concept of Mixture of Experts (MoE). By dynamically selecting tokens for attention heads, MoSA allows for arbitrary sparse attention patterns, reducing computational complexity from O(T^2) to O(k^2 + T) by selecting k tokens from a sequence of length T. This facilitates the use of more attention heads within the same computational budget, leading to improved performance. MoSA surpassed other sparse attention methods tested, showing up to 27% better perplexity with identical compute resources. Moreover, it demonstrated reduced resource usage compared to dense self-attention models, achieving faster training times, lower memory requirements, and a smaller KV-cache size even without optimized implementations. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA), a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel, perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time, require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model with a U-Net architecture to accelerate evaluations of a Cellular-Potts model (CPM) for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. The CNN model accounts for periodic boundary conditions and predicts 100 computational steps ahead, resulting in a significant 590 times acceleration compared to traditional CPM code execution. Despite the speed increase, the surrogate model effectively captures emergent behaviors such as vessel sprouting, extension, anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae observed in the original CPM. This demonstrates the potential of deep learning as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluations of computationally expensive biological processes on larger spatial and temporal scales. By combining the strengths of CNNs and CPMs, this innovative approach opens new possibilities for modeling intricate biological systems with enhanced efficiency and scalability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps, MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater spatial and temporal scales.

Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense, and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust, delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a wireless federated learning framework called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that fine-tunes compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large models to address resource constraints and communication overhead. A novel convergence analysis shows how LoRA rank and covariance effects impact training dynamics in federated learning. The paper proposes Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (SOFT) as an adaptive sparsification method to streamline parameter updates without costly operations. Additionally, the Two Stage Federated Algorithm (TSFA) is presented to adjust bandwidth and sparsification dynamically to ensure efficient training under latency constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this approach achieves comparable accuracy to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing communication overhead. This framework enables the scalable and resource-efficient deployment of large models in real-world wireless federated learning scenarios.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA}) algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

Summary:
- Text-to-video generative models have advanced in producing high-quality videos but often violate basic physical laws.
- The new benchmark, T2VPhysBench, evaluates if these models obey twelve core physical laws.
- Models score below 0.60 on average in each law category, showing compliance issues.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation, and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic, pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed. The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video generation.

<div> Keywords: optimizer, ultra-low-precision quantization, memory savings, computational resources, research accessibility

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel optimizer, SOLO, designed to reduce training and fine-tuning costs for large models by utilizing ultra-low-precision quantization. By operating at precision as low as 3 bits per state element, SOLO addresses challenges such as signal swamping and gradient variance to achieve significant memory savings of approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model. The optimizer overcomes limitations in traditional quantization methods by incorporating logarithmic quantization for signal dynamics and precision-specific momentum values for gradient descent directions. Despite the minimal loss in accuracy, SOLO offers substantial benefits in terms of computational resource efficiency. By enabling more efficient utilization of resources, SOLO aims to improve accessibility to fundamental research in the field of machine learning. <div>
arXiv:2505.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence. We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental research.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs. However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Summary: 
This study presents a novel safety-driven quantization framework for compressing deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices while maintaining performance. By leveraging preservation sets, the framework systematically prunes and quantizes neural network weights to optimize model complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental evaluations on both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention-based language model show that the framework can achieve up to a 2.5% improvement in test accuracy compared to unquantized models, while reducing model size by 60%. Unlike conventional quantization techniques, the proposed approach enhances generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential weights, resulting in reduced variance and the preservation of critical model features. The framework's implementation and experimental results are publicly available on GitHub. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights, thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental evaluations of our framework are publicly accessible at GitHub.

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called R&amp;B that addresses limitations in existing data mixing strategies for training language models. R&amp;B re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity to create finer-grained domains and optimizes data composition efficiently using a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients. Unlike previous methods, R&amp;B does not require additional compute for evaluation purposes. The article provides theoretical insights into the effectiveness of R&amp;B compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirical results demonstrate that R&amp;B achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets with minimal additional computational overhead, matching or exceeding the performance of existing strategies. This approach offers a more flexible and efficient way to improve language model training by considering semantic nuances and optimizing data composition. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws. First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via R&amp;B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity (Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and provide theoretical insights that justify R&amp;B's effectiveness compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R&amp;B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&amp;B matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

This fully online algorithm adaptively determines clustering radii using local similarity and micro-clustering to handle multi-density data. It addresses the challenge of complexly varying data densities and uses Locality-Sensitive Hashing for efficiency in high-dimensional cases. TNStream offers improved clustering quality for multi-density data by summarizing data evolution in micro-clusters and forming final clusters based on Tightest Neighbors.

arXiv:2505.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity, summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

This paper introduces the Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, transforming plain GNNs into hierarchical trees with coarsened graphs of varying granularity. TIF utilizes a graph coarsening module to compress original graphs into coarser ones while maintaining diversity among tree nodes.

arXiv:2505.00364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability, they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g., relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids, and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees) into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

The article introduces SacFL, a novel federated continual learning framework designed for end devices dealing with dynamic data. SacFL utilizes an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, reducing storage demands. It incorporates contrastive learning for autonomous data shift detection, enabling the device to detect new tasks and implement appropriate strategies independently. The framework is effective in class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios, as demonstrated through experiments on various datasets. A demo system confirms the practicality of SacFL for on-device machine learning applications. <div>
arXiv:2505.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm, wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system has been developed to verify its practicality.

Summary:
TransPDT is a Transformer-based model for package delivery time prediction in mixed logistics scenarios. It addresses the challenges of interlinked spatiotemporal factors, strict time constraints for pickups, and underexplored courier spatial mobility patterns. The model uses the Transformer encoder to capture dependencies in couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. It incorporates a pattern memory with attention mechanism to handle the impact of pickups in the dataset. Additionally, route prediction is used as an auxiliary task to improve delivery time prediction accuracy. Experimental results on real industry-scale datasets show the effectiveness of TransPDT. The model has been deployed in JD Logistics to track over 2000 couriers handling large package volumes daily in Beijing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers' spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior, but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT, a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in Beijing.

Summary: 
This paper delves into the theoretical analysis of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) in reinforcement learning by constructing a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based on the DQN algorithm. By estimating the Wasserstein-1 distance between the two, the authors provide an upper bound for the distance and prove its convergence to zero as the step size decreases. The study highlights the significance of DQN's techniques, such as experience replay and the target network, through the lens of continuous systems. Particularly, the delay term in the equation, linked to the target network, is shown to enhance the system's stability. The research utilizes a refined Lindeberg principle and operator comparison to establish these findings. <div>

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle and an operator comparison to establish these results.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with changing constraints. Existing approaches often allow occasional safety breaches, but this approach ensures strict safety with gradually evolving constraints. By employing a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in the dual space, the framework maintains zero constraint violation even with small changes in constraints between consecutive rounds. The use of a dichotomous learning rate enables both safety and sublinear regret. This work provides the first provable guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in OCO when constraints change dynamically. <div>

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds. This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints in OCO.

<div> Keywords: couriers, delivery timely rates, anomaly scenarios, deep spatial-temporal attention model, logistics industry

Summary:<br /><br />Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates is crucial in the logistics industry, especially during anomaly scenarios like the COVID-19 outbreak. Existing studies often overlook logistics scenarios and fail to explicitly model abnormal events, leading to information loss. To address these challenges, a deep spatial-temporal attention model, DeepSTA, is proposed. This model incorporates an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module with a recurrent neural network to capture incident information and Node2vec to model correlations between road districts. Graph neural networks and long short-term memory are used to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. An anomaly pattern attention module leveraging memory networks and attention mechanisms addresses data scarcity in abnormal conditions. Experimental results on real-world data from the COVID-19 outbreak showcase DeepSTA's superior performance compared to existing baselines, with a 12.11% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 13.71% improvement in Mean Squared Error (MSE). <div>

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines.

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables. The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision (0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

Summary: 
CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation) addresses the challenges of unsupervised time series anomaly detection in the presence of data distribution shifts across domains and non-stationarity over time. The key innovations of CICADA include a mixture of experts (MOE) framework for capturing domain-agnostic anomaly features, a selective meta-learning mechanism for preventing negative transfer between dissimilar domains, an adaptive expansion algorithm for handling emerging heterogeneous domains, and a hierarchical attention structure for enhancing interpretability. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain detection performance and interpretability. <div>

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE) framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and interpretability.

Summary:<br />
Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is crucial for regulatory and clinical safety. The study introduces a Transformer-based multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual information to predict device regulatory classification. The model utilizes a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a self-training strategy for enhanced generalization with limited supervision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision. Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3 percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1, suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Summary:
Dynamic validation is introduced to improve the scaling behavior of per-domain generalizing action policies, specifically GNN policies. This method generates the validation set dynamically on the fly, increasing instance size as long as it remains informative and feasible. Additionally, refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior is introduced, systematically generating test instances to ensure a given confidence in coverage performance for each instance size. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic validation in enhancing the scaling behavior of GNN policies across 9 domains. <div>
arXiv:2505.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test instances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger than training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior, generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

<div> Keywords: neural networks, adversarial training, generalised hyper-rectangles, differentiable logics, property-driven machine learning

Summary:<br />
Neural networks often fail to meet critical safety and correctness properties after training, emphasizing the importance of integrating these properties into training methods. Adversarial training improves robustness to small perturbations in computer vision but may need more flexible input region specifications for domains like control systems and natural language processing. Differentiable logics allow encoding of logical constraints as additional loss terms to guide learning towards satisfying these constraints. This paper explores unifying these approaches into a single framework for property-driven machine learning. Properties from the literature are found to be subcases of this general approach. The practical effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving a neural network controller for a drone system. The framework is openly available for use on GitHub at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within $\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Summary:
The article explores the application of a transformer model in predicting outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input signals. These systems exhibit dynamic behavior influenced by both physical parameters and external inputs, making accurate prediction challenging. By extending the transformer model to handle multiple outputs, the proposed multiple-output transformer enhances interpretability. It considers temporal correlations within the sequence as well as interactions between multiple outputs, providing insights into spatial correlations in the output domain. The model effectively predicts sequences of multiple outputs, even in nonlinear systems and high-dimensional parameter spaces. <div>

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

The study explores the relationship between sparsity and interpretability in machine learning, particularly in language transformers. They introduce a self-ablation mechanism that enforces selective activation in neuron and attention units during model training. Results show that self-ablation leads to more localized circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron specialization without affecting language modeling performance. Surprisingly, the method decreased overall sparsity while promoting specialization, indicating a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability. The findings suggest that decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization, ultimately enhancing interpretability.

Abstract: A growing intuition in machine learning suggests a link between sparsity and interpretability. We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron specialization without compromising language modelling performance. Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization, leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make our code available at https://github.com/keenanpepper/self-ablating-transformers.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel RL algorithm called Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO) for molecule generation in drug discovery. Current RL approaches face catastrophic forgetting during the generation process, where molecule validity deteriorates significantly. PSV-PPO addresses this issue by incorporating real-time partial validation of SMILES at each step, allowing early detection of invalid partial structures. This approach ensures high validity rates even during aggressive exploration of the chemical space. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PSV-PPO reduces the number of invalid structures while maintaining competitive exploration and optimization performance. The framework of PSV-PPO can be further extended to incorporate additional domain knowledge, enhancing reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM) has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\% during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating, resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+. LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6% computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

Summary: <br />
KnowEEG is a new explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification, addressing the issue of model explainability. It extracts per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics to improve classification performance. The modified Random Forest model, Fusion Forest, balances per-electrode statistics with between-electrode connectivity features, achieving high performance across various classification tasks such as emotion detection and abnormal EEG classification. KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores, allowing for the discovery of knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge has been validated by current neuroscience literature, demonstrating the significance of KnowEEG in domains where EEG explainability is crucial, such as healthcare. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification. KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model (Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains, KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection, mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature. Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG explainability is critical such as healthcare.

<title>Directly Forecasting Belief for Reinforcement Learning with Delays</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT), directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods, yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy. DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains. However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number of trainable parameters.

<title>Unlocking the Potential of Linear Networks for Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00590</link>

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate. Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by 11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding. These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new directions.

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update. The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art continuous control methods.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and reasoning traces will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva.

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions. Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved, been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP) vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan. Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

Abstract: Buffered Linear Toeplitz (BLT) matrices are a family of parameterized lower-triangular matrices that play an important role in streaming differential privacy with correlated noise. Our main result is a BLT inversion theorem: the inverse of a BLT matrix is itself a BLT matrix with different parameters. We also present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the parameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original BLT (typically $d < 10$). Our characterization enables direct optimization of BLT parameters for privacy mechanisms through automatic differentiation.

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual, organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics data is critical for advancing both diagnostic and pathogenesis research. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19. Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation, our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1) assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics (consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs' capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust, and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content, text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation. However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate. Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4), with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases. Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect. Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach, face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases, offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in open-book QA systems.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of 45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of fraud detection systems.

<title>Algorithmic Collective Action with Two Collectives</title>

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence, individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size, membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use their own data to promote their own interests.

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors relative to prior work.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals, utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean exploration and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Max-Linear Bayesian Networks (MLBNs) provide a powerful framework for causal inference in extreme-value settings; we consider MLBNs with noise parameters with a given topology in terms of the max-plus algebra by taking its logarithm. Then, we show that an estimator of a parameter for each edge in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is distributed normally. We end this paper with computational experiments with the expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm and quadratic optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately 200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization stability compared to conventional methods.

<title>Future-Oriented Navigation: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with One-Shot Energy-Based Multimodal Motion Prediction</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples' interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic: it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at {https://github.com/Higashiguchi-Shingo/D-Tracker.

<title>A Unifying Framework for Robust and Efficient Inference with Unstructured Data</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text, images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions, linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference. We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data, demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load, demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically, we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average (FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing 7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence (AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks. However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management. Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in, e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work, we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion. Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will be available after the revision process.

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically, human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints, with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation (DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm.

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition, existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition systems.

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator. Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally, pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible to researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach, this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment without the need for explicit communication between agents.

<title>Graph Spectral Filtering with Chebyshev Interpolation for Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding, it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at https://github.com/mengyuest/TeLoGraF

<title>Hypothesis-free discovery from epidemiological data by automatic detection and local inference for tree-based nonlinearities and interactions</title>

Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

<title>Transition States Energies from Machine Learning: An Application to Reverse Water-Gas Shift on Single-Atom Alloys</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00574</link>

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF) predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models. Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS, providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant matrices and one-dimensional Fourier transforms to reduce storage and computation costs. Experiments show that our method uses $14\times$ less number of parameters than VeRA, $16\times$ smaller than LoRA and $32\times$ less FLOPs than FourierFT, while maintaining close or better task performance. Our approach presents a promising way in frequency domain to fine-tune large models on downstream tasks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.00586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories, incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories. We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming existing methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance, introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel \textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading (\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for real-world disease image grading.

Abstract: Deterministic partially observable Markov decision processes (DetPOMDPs) often arise in planning problems where the agent is uncertain about its environmental state but can act and observe deterministically. In this paper, we propose DetMCVI, an adaptation of the Monte Carlo Value Iteration (MCVI) algorithm for DetPOMDPs, which builds policies in the form of finite-state controllers (FSCs). DetMCVI solves large problems with a high success rate, outperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance of the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies. This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food, allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential. Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The 3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and accurate dietary monitoring tools.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions, including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains, largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations, such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/DetectiveMB/Task-Arithmetic-for-ZS-IR.

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

<title>On the generalization of language models from in-context learning and finetuning: a controlled study</title>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models. However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining, to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

<title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Urban Air Quality Management: Multi-Objective Optimization of Pollution Mitigation Booth Placement in Metropolitan Environments</title>

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.

<title>Learning Against Distributional Uncertainty: On the Trade-off Between Robustness and Specificity</title>

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning aims at combating distributional uncertainties in training data distributions compared to population distributions. Typical treatment frameworks include the Bayesian approach, (min-max) distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and regularization. However, three issues have to be raised: 1) the prior distribution in the Bayesian method and the regularizer in the regularization method are difficult to specify; 2) the DRO method tends to be overly conservative; 3) all the three methods are biased estimators of the true optimal cost. This paper studies a new framework that unifies the three approaches and addresses the three challenges above. The asymptotic properties (e.g., consistencies and asymptotic normalities), non-asymptotic properties (e.g., generalization bounds and unbiasedness), and solution methods of the proposed model are studied. The new model reveals the trade-off between the robustness to the unseen data and the specificity to the training data. Experiments on various real-world tasks validate the superiority of the proposed learning framework.

<title>Learning An Active Inference Model of Driver Perception and Control: Application to Vehicle Car-Following</title>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a general estimation methodology for learning a model of human perception and control in a sensorimotor control task based upon a finite set of demonstrations. The model's structure consists of i the agent's internal representation of how the environment and associated observations evolve as a result of control actions and ii the agent's preferences over observable outcomes. We consider a model's structure specification consistent with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a promising alternative to black-box models of driving.

Abstract: We explore "omitted label contexts," in which training data is limited to a subset of the possible labels. This setting is standard among specialized human experts or specific, focused studies. By studying Simpson's paradox, we observe that ``correct'' adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups. A generalization of Simpson's paradox leads us to study networks of conclusions drawn from different contexts, within which a paradox of nontransitivity arises. We prove that the space of possible nontransitive structures in these networks exactly corresponds to structures that form from aggregating ranked-choice votes.

Abstract: Class-wise characteristics of training examples affect the performance of deep classifiers. A well-studied example is when the number of training examples of classes follows a long-tailed distribution, a situation that is likely to yield sub-optimal performance for under-represented classes. This class imbalance problem is conventionally addressed by approaches relying on the class-wise cardinality of training examples, such as data resampling. In this paper, we demonstrate that considering solely the cardinality of classes does not cover all issues causing class imbalance. To measure class imbalance, we propose "Class Uncertainty" as the average predictive uncertainty of the training examples, and we show that this novel measure captures the differences across classes better than cardinality. We also curate SVCI-20 as a novel dataset in which the classes have equal number of training examples but they differ in terms of their hardness; thereby causing a type of class imbalance which cannot be addressed by the approaches relying on cardinality. We incorporate our "Class Uncertainty" measure into a diverse set of ten class imbalance mitigation methods to demonstrate its effectiveness on long-tailed datasets as well as on our SVCI-20. Code and datasets will be made available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have shown promising performance on various tasks. However, due to the huge model sizes, running them in resource-constrained environments where the GPU memory is not abundant is challenging. Some existing systems propose to use CPU resources to solve that, but they either suffer from the significant overhead of frequently moving data between CPU and GPU, or fail to consider distinct characteristics of CPUs and GPUs. This paper proposes Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference system for MoE models with limited GPU resources. Fiddler strategically utilizes CPU and GPU resources by determining the optimal execution strategy. Our evaluation shows that, unlike state-of-the-art systems that optimize for specific scenarios such as single batch inference or long prefill, Fiddler performs better in all scenarios. Compared against different baselines, Fiddler achieves 1.26 times speed up in single batch inference, 1.30 times in long prefill processing, and 11.57 times in beam search inference. The code of Fiddler is publicly available at https://github.com/efeslab/fiddler.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification models have gained increasing attention in recent years as concerns grow on discrimination against some demographic groups. Most existing models require full knowledge of the sensitive features, which can be impractical due to privacy, legal issues, and an individual's fear of discrimination. The key challenge we will address is the group dependency of the unavailability, e.g., people of some age range may be more reluctant to reveal their age. Our solution augments general fairness risks with probabilistic imputations of the sensitive features, while jointly learning the group-conditionally missing probabilities in a variational auto-encoder. Our model is demonstrated effective on both image and tabular datasets, achieving an improved balance between accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks. This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.

Abstract: Conventional mechanical design follows an iterative process in which initial concepts are refined through cycles of expert assessment and resource-intensive Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis to meet performance goals. While machine learning models have been developed to assist in parts of this process, they typically require large datasets, extensive training, and are often tailored to specific tasks, limiting their generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a framework that leverages a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) in conjunction with an FEM module to autonomously generate, evaluate, and refine structural designs based on performance specifications and numerical feedback. The LLM operates without domain-specific fine-tuning, using general reasoning to propose design candidates, interpret FEM-derived performance metrics, and apply structurally sound modifications. Using 2D truss structures as a testbed, we show that the LLM can effectively navigate highly discrete and multi-faceted design spaces, balance competing objectives, and identify convergence when further optimization yields diminishing returns. Compared to Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), our method achieves faster convergence and fewer FEM evaluations. Experiments with varying temperature settings (0.5, 1.0, 1.2) and model sizes (GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini) indicate that smaller models yield higher constraint satisfaction with fewer steps, while lower temperatures enhance design consistency. These results establish LLMs as a promising new class of reasoning-based, natural language-driven optimizers for autonomous design and iterative structural refinement.

Abstract: The diffusion bridge, which is a diffusion process conditioned on hitting a specific state within a finite period, has found broad applications in various scientific and engineering fields. However, simulating diffusion bridges for modeling natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain under explored. This paper presents a method that merges score matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to learn the infinite-dimensional bridge and achieving a discretization equivariant bridge simulation. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data. Our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.

Abstract: Recently, a tensor-on-tensor (ToT) regression model has been proposed to generalize tensor recovery, encompassing scenarios like scalar-on-tensor regression and tensor-on-vector regression. However, the exponential growth in tensor complexity poses challenges for storage and computation in ToT regression. To overcome this hurdle, tensor decompositions have been introduced, with the tensor train (TT)-based ToT model proving efficient in practice due to reduced memory requirements, enhanced computational efficiency, and decreased sampling complexity. Despite these practical benefits, a disparity exists between theoretical analysis and real-world performance. In this paper, we delve into the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the TT-based ToT regression model. Assuming the regression operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we conduct an error analysis for the solution to a constrained least-squares optimization problem. This analysis includes upper error bound and minimax lower bound, revealing that such error bounds polynomially depend on the order $N+M$. To efficiently find solutions meeting such error bounds, we propose two optimization algorithms: the iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm (employing gradient descent with TT-singular value decomposition (TT-SVD)) and the factorization approach using the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm. When RIP is satisfied, spectral initialization facilitates proper initialization, and we establish the linear convergence rate of both IHT and RGD.

Abstract: Unsupervised graph alignment finds the node correspondence between a pair of attributed graphs by only exploiting graph structure and node features. One category of recent studies first computes the node representation and then matches nodes with the largest embedding-based similarity, while the other category reduces the problem to optimal transport (OT) via Gromov-Wasserstein learning. However, it remains largely unexplored in the model expressiveness, as well as how theoretical expressivity impacts prediction accuracy. We investigate the model expressiveness from two aspects. First, we characterize the model's discriminative power in distinguishing matched and unmatched node pairs across two graphs.Second, we study the model's capability of guaranteeing node matching properties such as one-to-one matching and mutual alignment. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we put forward a hybrid approach named CombAlign with stronger expressive power. Specifically, we enable cross-dimensional feature interaction for OT-based learning and propose an embedding-based method inspired by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. We also apply non-uniform marginals obtained from the embedding-based modules to OT as priors for more expressiveness. Based on that, we propose a traditional algorithm-based refinement, which combines our OT and embedding-based predictions using the ensemble learning strategy and reduces the problem to maximum weight matching. With carefully designed edge weights, we ensure those matching properties and further enhance prediction accuracy. By extensive experiments, we demonstrate a significant improvement of 14.5% in alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches and confirm the soundness of our theoretical analysis.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{DRTR}, a novel graph learning framework that integrates distance-aware multi-hop message passing with dynamic topology refinement. Unlike standard GNNs that rely on shallow, fixed-hop aggregation, DRTR leverages both static preprocessing and dynamic resampling to capture deeper structural dependencies. A \emph{Distance Recomputator} prunes semantically weak edges using adaptive attention, while a \emph{Topology Reconstructor} establishes latent connections among distant but relevant nodes. This joint mechanism enables more expressive and robust representation learning across evolving graph structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRTR outperforms baseline GNNs in both accuracy and scalability, especially in complex and noisy graph environments.

Abstract: In traditional models of supervised learning, the goal of a learner -- given examples from an arbitrary joint distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \{\pm 1\}$ -- is to output a hypothesis that is competitive (to within $\epsilon$) of the best fitting concept from some class. In order to escape strong hardness results for learning even simple concept classes, we introduce a smoothed-analysis framework that requires a learner to compete only with the best classifier that is robust to small random Gaussian perturbation.
  This subtle change allows us to give a wide array of learning results for any concept that (1) depends on a low-dimensional subspace (aka multi-index model) and (2) has a bounded Gaussian surface area. This class includes functions of halfspaces and (low-dimensional) convex sets, cases that are only known to be learnable in non-smoothed settings with respect to highly structured distributions such as Gaussians.
  Surprisingly, our analysis also yields new results for traditional non-smoothed frameworks such as learning with margin. In particular, we obtain the first algorithm for agnostically learning intersections of $k$-halfspaces in time $k^{poly(\frac{\log k}{\epsilon \gamma}) }$ where $\gamma$ is the margin parameter. Before our work, the best-known runtime was exponential in $k$ (Arriaga and Vempala, 1999).

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in learning from graph-structured data. However, their application to directed graphs (digraphs) presents unique challenges, primarily due to the inherent asymmetry in node relationships. Traditional GNNs are adept at capturing unidirectional relations but fall short in encoding the mutual path dependencies between nodes, such as asymmetrical shortest paths typically found in digraphs. Recognizing this gap, we introduce Commute Graph Neural Networks (CGNN), an approach that seamlessly integrates node-wise commute time into the message passing scheme. The cornerstone of CGNN is an efficient method for computing commute time using a newly formulated digraph Laplacian. Commute time is then integrated into the neighborhood aggregation process, with neighbor contributions weighted according to their respective commute time to the central node in each layer. It enables CGNN to directly capture the mutual, asymmetric relationships in digraphs. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarking datasets confirm the superiority of CGNN against 13 state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Background: AI-driven prediction algorithms have the potential to enhance emergency medicine by enabling rapid and accurate decision-making regarding patient status and potential deterioration. However, the integration of multimodal data, including raw waveform signals, remains underexplored in clinical decision support. Methods: We present a dataset and benchmarking protocol designed to advance multimodal decision support in emergency care. Our models utilize demographics, biometrics, vital signs, laboratory values, and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms as inputs to predict both discharge diagnoses and patient deterioration. Results: The diagnostic model achieves area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) scores above 0.8 for 609 out of 1,428 conditions, covering both cardiac (e.g., myocardial infarction) and non-cardiac (e.g., renal disease, diabetes) diagnoses. The deterioration model attains AUROC scores above 0.8 for 14 out of 15 targets, accurately predicting critical events such as cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and mortality. Conclusions: Our study highlights the positive impact of incorporating raw waveform data into decision support models, improving predictive performance. By introducing a unique, publicly available dataset and baseline models, we provide a foundation for measurable progress in AI-driven decision support for emergency care.

Abstract: Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses, despite having access to preference data that includes reward scores from judge models during AI feedback. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to optimal responses that are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. The experiments across various benchmarks and diverse models demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts DPO by a considerable margin. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere data expansion. Our code is available at https://github.com/shenao-zhang/reward-augmented-preference.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical task that provides key information for decision-making. After traditional statistical and machine learning approaches, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context, architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and present recent trends, including hybrid, diffusion, Mamba, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction. These contributions help lower entry barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader perspectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.

Abstract: We consider the problem of finite-horizon sequential experimental design to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box objective functions. This problem arises in many real-world applications, including materials design, where we have a small resource budget to make and evaluate candidate materials in the lab. We solve this problem using the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose the first set of non-myopic methods for MOO problems. Prior work on non-myopic BO for single-objective problems relies on the Bellman optimality principle to handle the lookahead reasoning process. However, this principle does not hold for most MOO problems because the reward function needs to satisfy some conditions: scalar variable, monotonicity, and additivity. We address this challenge by using hypervolume improvement (HVI) as our scalarization approach, which allows us to use a lower-bound on the Bellman equation to approximate the finite-horizon using a batch expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition function (AF) for MOO. Our formulation naturally allows us to use other improvement-based scalarizations and compare their efficacy to HVI. We derive three non-myopic AFs for MOBO: 1) the Nested AF, which is based on the exact computation of the lower bound, 2) the Joint AF, which is a lower bound on the nested AF, and 3) the BINOM AF, which is a fast and approximate variant based on batch multi-objective acquisition functions. Our experiments on multiple diverse real-world MO problems demonstrate that our non-myopic AFs substantially improve performance over the existing myopic AFs for MOBO.

For for achieving realistic and consistent outputs, it is crucial to embed physical knowledge into their learned representations. However, doing so is difficult due to high-dimensional observation data, such as images, particularly under conditions of incomplete system knowledge and imprecise state sensing. To address this, we propose Physically Interpretable World Models, a novel architecture that aligns learned latent representations with real-world physical quantities. To this end, our architecture combines three key elements: (1) a vector-quantized image autoencoder, (2) a transformer-based physically interpretable autoencoder, and (3) a partially known dynamical model. The training incorporates weak interval-based supervision to eliminate the impractical reliance on ground-truth physical knowledge. Three case studies demonstrate that our approach achieves physical interpretability and accurate state predictions, thus advancing representation learning for robotics.

Abstract: Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.

Abstract: This paper introduces innovative enhancements to the K-means and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithms based on the concept of Gini prametric spaces. Unlike traditional distance metrics, Gini-based measures incorporate both value-based and rank-based information, improving robustness to noise and outliers. The main contributions of this work include: proposing a Gini-based measure that captures both rank information and value distances; presenting a Gini K-means algorithm that is proven to converge and demonstrates resilience to noisy data; and introducing a Gini KNN method that performs competitively with state-of-the-art approaches such as Hassanat's distance in noisy environments. Experimental evaluations on 14 datasets from the UCI repository demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of Gini-based algorithms in clustering and classification tasks. This work opens new avenues for leveraging rank-based measures in machine learning and statistical analysis.

Abstract: The goal of offline model-based optimization (MBO) is to propose new designs that maximize a reward function given only an offline dataset. However, an important desiderata is to also propose a diverse set of final candidates that capture many optimal and near-optimal design configurations. We propose Diversity in Adversarial Model-based Optimization (DynAMO) as a novel method to introduce design diversity as an explicit objective into any MBO problem. Our key insight is to formulate diversity as a distribution matching problem where the distribution of generated designs captures the inherent diversity contained within the offline dataset. Extensive experiments spanning multiple scientific domains show that DynAMO can be used with common optimization methods to significantly improve the diversity of proposed designs while still discovering high-quality candidates.

Abstract: Transmission grid congestion increases as the electrification of various sectors requires transmitting more power. Topology control, through substation reconfiguration, can reduce congestion but its potential remains under-exploited in operations. A challenge is modeling the topology control problem to align well with the objectives and constraints of operators. Addressing this challenge, this paper investigates the application of multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) to integrate multiple conflicting objectives for power grid topology control. We develop a MORL approach using deep optimistic linear support (DOL) and multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO) to generate a set of Pareto-optimal policies that balance objectives such as minimizing line loading, topological deviation, and switching frequency. Initial case studies show that the MORL approach can provide valuable insights into objective trade-offs and improve Pareto front approximation compared to a random search baseline. The generated multi-objective RL policies are 30% more successful in preventing grid failure under contingencies and 20% more effective when training budget is reduced - compared to the common single objective RL policy.

Abstract: Recent work by Foster et al. (2021, 2022, 2023b) and Xu and Zeevi (2023) developed the framework of decision estimation coefficient (DEC) that characterizes the complexity of general online decision making problems and provides a general algorithm design principle. These works, however, either focus on the pure stochastic regime where the world remains fixed over time, or the pure adversarial regime where the world arbitrarily changes over time. For the hybrid regime where the dynamics of the world is fixed while the reward arbitrarily changes, they only give pessimistic bounds on the decision complexity. In this work, we propose a general extension of DEC that more precisely characterizes this case. Besides applications in special cases, our framework leads to a flexible algorithm design where the learner learns over subsets of the hypothesis set, trading estimation complexity with decision complexity, which could be of independent interest. Our work covers model-based learning and model-free learning in the hybrid regime, with a newly proposed extension of the bilinear classes (Du et al., 2021) to the adversarial-reward case. In addition, our method improves the best-known regret bounds for linear Q*/V* MDPs in the pure stochastic regime.

Abstract: The burgeoning volume of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled deep learning models to excel in predictive healthcare. However, for high-stakes applications such as diagnosis prediction, model interpretability remains paramount. Existing deep learning diagnosis prediction models with intrinsic interpretability often assign attention weights to every past diagnosis or hospital visit, providing explanations lacking flexibility and succinctness. In this paper, we introduce SHy, a self-explaining hypergraph neural network model, designed to offer personalized, concise and faithful explanations that allow for interventions from clinical experts. By modeling each patient as a unique hypergraph and employing a message-passing mechanism, SHy captures higher-order disease interactions and extracts distinct temporal phenotypes as personalized explanations. It also addresses the incompleteness of the EHR data by accounting for essential false negatives in the original diagnosis record. A qualitative case study and extensive quantitative evaluations on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate the superior predictive performance and interpretability of SHy over existing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: An efficient attention implementation is essential for large models due to its quadratic time complexity. Fortunately, attention commonly exhibits sparsity, i.e., many values in the attention map are near zero, allowing for the omission of corresponding computations. Many studies have utilized the sparse pattern to accelerate attention. However, most existing works focus on optimizing attention within specific models by exploiting certain sparse patterns of the attention map. A universal sparse attention that guarantees both the speedup and end-to-end performance of diverse models remains elusive. In this paper, we propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention for any model. Our method uses a two-stage online filter: in the first stage, we rapidly and accurately predict the attention map, enabling the skip of some matrix multiplications in attention. In the second stage, we design an online softmax-aware filter that incurs no extra overhead and further skips some matrix multiplications. Experiments show that our method significantly accelerates diverse models, including language, image, and video generation, without sacrificing end-to-end metrics. The codes are available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SpargeAttn.

Abstract: Machine unlearning, where users can request the deletion of a forget dataset, is becoming increasingly important because of numerous privacy regulations. Initial works on ``exact'' unlearning (e.g., retraining) incur large computational overheads. However, while computationally inexpensive, ``approximate'' methods have fallen short of reaching the effectiveness of exact unlearning: models produced fail to obtain comparable accuracy and prediction confidence on both the forget and test (i.e., unseen) dataset. Exploiting this observation, we propose a new unlearning method, Adversarial Machine UNlearning (AMUN), that outperforms prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for image classification. AMUN lowers the confidence of the model on the forget samples by fine-tuning the model on their corresponding adversarial examples. Adversarial examples naturally belong to the distribution imposed by the model on the input space; fine-tuning the model on the adversarial examples closest to the corresponding forget samples (a) localizes the changes to the decision boundary of the model around each forget sample and (b) avoids drastic changes to the global behavior of the model, thereby preserving the model's accuracy on test samples. Using AMUN for unlearning a random $10\%$ of CIFAR-10 samples, we observe that even SOTA membership inference attacks cannot do better than random guessing.

Abstract: Land cover classification involves the production of land cover maps, which determine the type of land through remote sensing imagery. Over recent years, such classification is being performed by machine learning classification models, which can give highly accurate predictions on land cover per pixel using large quantities of input training data. However, such models do not currently take account of input measurement uncertainty, which is vital for traceability in metrology. In this work we propose a Bayesian classification framework using generative modelling to take account of input measurement uncertainty. We take the specific case of Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis, and apply it to land cover datasets from Copernicus Sentinel-2 in 2020 and 2021. We benchmark the performance of the model against more popular classification models used in land cover maps such as random forests and neural networks. We find that such Bayesian models are more trustworthy, in the sense that they are more interpretable, explicitly model the input measurement uncertainty, and maintain predictive performance of class probability outputs across datasets of different years and sizes, whilst also being computationally efficient.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models without extensive reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this work, we revisit the traditional Policy Gradient (PG) mechanism and propose a minimalist RL approach termed Group Policy Gradient (GPG). Unlike conventional methods, GPG directly optimize the original RL objective, thus obviating the need for surrogate loss functions. By eliminating the critic and reference models, avoiding KL divergence constraints, and addressing the advantage and gradient estimation bias, our approach significantly simplifies the training process compared to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach achieves superior performance without relying on auxiliary techniques or adjustments. As illustrated in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only reduces computational costs but also consistently outperforms GRPO across various unimodal and multimodal tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/GPG.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) classification models are increasingly being used in a wide range of applications where it is important that predictions are accompanied by uncertainties, including in climate and earth observation, medical diagnosis and bioaerosol monitoring. The output of an ML classification model is a type of categorical variable known as a nominal property in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM). However, concepts related to uncertainty evaluation for nominal properties are not defined in the VIM, nor is such evaluation addressed by the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). In this paper we propose a metrological conceptual uncertainty evaluation framework for ML classification, and illustrate its use in the context of two applications that exemplify the issues and have significant societal impact, namely, climate and earth observation and medical diagnosis. Our framework would enable an extension of the VIM and GUM to uncertainty for nominal properties, which would make both applicable to ML classification models.

Abstract: We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been the predominant generative model for tabular data generation. However, they face the conundrum of modeling under a separate versus a unified data representation. The former encounters the challenge of jointly modeling all multi-modal distributions of tabular data in one model. While the latter alleviates this by learning a single representation for all features, it currently leverages sparse suboptimal encoding heuristics and necessitates additional computation costs. In this work, we address the latter by presenting TabRep, a tabular diffusion architecture trained with a unified continuous representation. To motivate the design of our representation, we provide geometric insights into how the data manifold affects diffusion models. The key attributes of our representation are composed of its density, flexibility to provide ample separability for nominal features, and ability to preserve intrinsic relationships. Ultimately, TabRep provides a simple yet effective approach for training tabular diffusion models under a continuous data manifold. Our results showcase that TabRep achieves superior performance across a broad suite of evaluations. It is the first to synthesize tabular data that exceeds the downstream quality of the original datasets while preserving privacy and remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has shown great potential for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it is often sample- and compute-inefficient, requiring extensive training. In this work, we introduce AdaRFT (Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning), a method that significantly improves both the efficiency and final accuracy of RFT through adaptive curriculum learning. AdaRFT dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training problems based on the model's recent reward signals, ensuring that the model consistently trains on tasks that are challenging but solvable. This adaptive sampling strategy accelerates learning by maintaining an optimal difficulty range, avoiding wasted computation on problems that are too easy or too hard. AdaRFT requires only a lightweight extension to standard RFT algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), without modifying the reward function or model architecture. Experiments on competition-level math datasets-including AMC, AIME, and IMO-style problems-demonstrate that AdaRFT significantly improves both training efficiency and reasoning performance. We evaluate AdaRFT across multiple data distributions and model sizes, showing that it reduces training time by up to 2x and improves accuracy by a considerable margin, offering a more scalable and effective RFT framework.

Abstract: Motivated by the growing demand for low-precision arithmetic in computational science, we exploit lower-precision emulation in Python -- widely regarded as the dominant programming language for numerical analysis and machine learning. Low-precision training has revolutionized deep learning by enabling more efficient computation and reduced memory and energy consumption while maintaining model fidelity. To better enable numerical experimentation with and exploration of low precision computation, we developed the Pychop library, which supports customizable floating-point formats and a comprehensive set of rounding modes in Python, allowing users to benefit from fast, low-precision emulation in numerous applications. Pychop also introduces interfaces for both PyTorch and JAX, enabling efficient low-precision emulation on GPUs for neural network training and inference with unparalleled flexibility.
  In this paper, we offer a comprehensive exposition of the design, implementation, validation, and practical application of Pychop, establishing it as a foundational tool for advancing efficient mixed-precision algorithms. Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact. Pychop enables in-depth investigations into the effects of numerical precision, facilitates the development of novel hardware accelerators, and integrates seamlessly into existing deep learning workflows.

Abstract: Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning suffer from limited storage capacity. While supervised methods like Linear Logistic Regression (LLR) offer some improvement, kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) significantly enhance capacity and noise robustness. However, KLR requires computationally expensive iterative learning. We propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an efficient kernel-based alternative for learning high-capacity Hopfield networks. KRR utilizes the kernel trick and predicts bipolar states via regression, crucially offering a non-iterative, closed-form solution for learning dual variables. We evaluate KRR and compare its performance against Hebbian, LLR, and KLR. Our results demonstrate that KRR achieves state-of-the-art storage capacity (reaching $\beta$=1.5) and noise robustness, comparable to KLR. Crucially, KRR drastically reduces training time, being orders of magnitude faster than LLR and significantly faster than KLR, especially at higher storage loads. This establishes KRR as a potent and highly efficient method for building high-performance associative memories, providing comparable performance to KLR with substantial training speed advantages. This work provides the first empirical comparison between KRR and KLR in the context of Hopfield network learning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning simulation-trained RL agents with real-world data often degrades crucial behaviors due to limited or skewed data distributions. We argue that designer priorities exist not just in reward functions, but also in simulation design choices like task selection and state initialization. When adapting to real-world data, agents can experience catastrophic forgetting in important but underrepresented scenarios. We propose framing live-adaptation as a multi-objective optimization problem, where policy objectives must be satisfied both in simulation and reality. Our approach leverages critics from simulation as "anchors for design intent" (anchor critics). By jointly optimizing policies against both anchor critics and critics trained on real-world experience, our method enables adaptation while preserving prioritized behaviors from simulation. Evaluations demonstrate robust behavior retention in sim-to-sim benchmarks and a sim-to-real scenario with a racing quadrotor, allowing for power consumption reductions of up to 50% without control loss. We also contribute SwaNNFlight, an open-source firmware for enabling live adaptation on similar robotic platforms.

Abstract: We exploit analogies between first-order algorithms for constrained optimization and non-smooth dynamical systems to design a new class of accelerated first-order algorithms for constrained optimization. Unlike Frank-Wolfe or projected gradients, these algorithms avoid optimization over the entire feasible set at each iteration. We prove convergence to stationary points even in a nonconvex setting and we derive accelerated rates for the convex setting both in continuous time, as well as in discrete time. An important property of these algorithms is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities instead of positions, which naturally leads to sparse, local and convex approximations of the feasible set (even if the feasible set is nonconvex). Thus, the complexity tends to grow mildly in the number of decision variables and in the number of constraints, which makes the algorithms suitable for machine learning applications. We apply our algorithms to a compressed sensing and a sparse regression problem, showing that we can treat nonconvex $\ell^p$ constraints ($p<1$) efficiently, while recovering state-of-the-art performance for $p=1$.

Abstract: This paper studies a class of convex Finite-sum Coupled Compositional Optimization (cFCCO) problems with applications including group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) and learning with imbalanced data. To better address these problems, we introduce an efficient single-loop primal-dual block-coordinate stochastic algorithm called ALEXR. The algorithm employs block-coordinate stochastic mirror ascent with extrapolation for the dual variable and stochastic proximal gradient descent updates for the primal variable. We establish the convergence rates of ALEXR in both convex and strongly convex cases under smoothness and non-smoothness conditions of involved functions, which not only improve the best rates in previous works on smooth cFCCO problems but also expand the realm of cFCCO for solving more challenging non-smooth problems such as the dual form of GDRO. Finally, we derive lower complexity bounds, demonstrating the (near-)optimality of ALEXR within a broad class of stochastic algorithms for cFCCO. Experimental results on GDRO and partial Area Under the ROC Curve (pAUC) maximization demonstrate the promising performance of our algorithm.

<title>QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving</title>

Abstract: Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

<title>Folded Context Condensation in Path Integral Formalism for Infinite Context Transformers</title>

Abstract: In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.

<title>A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Assessing Cryptographic Indistinguishability of Lightweight Block Ciphers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19683</link>

Abstract: Indistinguishability is a fundamental principle of cryptographic security, crucial for securing data transmitted between Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This principle ensures that an attacker cannot distinguish between the encrypted data, also known as ciphertext, and random data or the ciphertexts of the two messages encrypted with the same key. This research investigates the ability of machine learning (ML) in assessing indistinguishability property in encryption systems, with a focus on lightweight ciphers. As our first case study, we consider the SPECK32/64 and SIMON32/64 lightweight block ciphers, designed for IoT devices operating under significant energy constraints.
  In this research, we introduce MIND-Crypt, a novel ML-based framework designed to assess the cryptographic indistinguishability of lightweight block ciphers, specifically the SPECK32/64 and SIMON32/64 encryption algorithm in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), under Known Plaintext Attacks (KPA). Our approach involves training ML models using ciphertexts from two plaintext messages encrypted with same key to determine whether ML algorithms can identify meaningful cryptographic patterns or leakage. Our experiments show that modern ML techniques consistently achieve accuracy equivalent to random guessing, indicating that no statistically exploitable patterns exists in the ciphertexts generated by considered lightweight block ciphers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in ML algorithms with all the possible combinations of the ciphertexts for given plaintext messages reflects memorization rather than generalization to unseen ciphertexts.
  Collectively, these findings suggest that existing block ciphers have secure cryptographic designs against ML-based indistinguishability assessments, reinforcing their security even under round-reduced conditions.

Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects such as conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) and conditional quantile treatment effects (CQTEs) play an important role in real-world decision making. Given this importance, one should ensure these estimates are calibrated. While there is a rich literature on calibrating estimators of non-causal parameters, very few methods have been derived for calibrating estimators of causal parameters, or more generally estimators of quantities involving nuisance parameters. In this work, we develop general algorithms for reducing the task of causal calibration to that of calibrating a standard (non-causal) predictive model.
  Throughout, we study a notion of calibration defined with respect to an arbitrary, nuisance-dependent loss $\ell$, under which we say an estimator $\theta$ is calibrated if its predictions cannot be changed on any level set to decrease loss. For losses $\ell$ satisfying a condition called universal orthogonality, we present a simple algorithm that transforms partially-observed data into generalized pseudo-outcomes and applies any off-the-shelf calibration procedure. For losses $\ell$ satisfying a weaker assumption called conditional orthogonality, we provide a similar sample splitting algorithm the performs empirical risk minimization over an appropriately defined class of functions. Convergence of both algorithms follows from a generic, two term upper bound of the calibration error of any model. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our results in experiments on both observational and synthetic data. Our results are exceedingly general, showing that essentially any existing calibration algorithm can be used in causal settings, with additional loss only arising from errors in nuisance estimation.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into healthcare systems holds great promise for enhancing patient care and care delivery efficiency; however, it also exposes sensitive data and system integrity to potential cyberattacks. Current security and privacy (S&amp;P) research on healthcare AI is highly unbalanced in terms of healthcare deployment scenarios and threat models, and has a disconnected focus with the biomedical research community. This hinders a comprehensive understanding of the risks that healthcare AI entails. To address this gap, this paper takes a thorough examination of existing healthcare AI S&amp;P research, providing a unified framework that allows the identification of under-explored areas. Our survey presents a systematic overview of healthcare AI attacks and defenses, and points out challenges and research opportunities for each AI-driven healthcare application domain. Through our experimental analysis of different threat models and feasibility studies on under-explored adversarial attacks, we provide compelling insights into the pressing need for cybersecurity research in the rapidly evolving field of healthcare AI.

Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.

Abstract: Toxicity text detectors can be vulnerable to adversarial examples - small perturbations to input text that fool the systems into wrong detection. Existing attack algorithms are time-consuming and often produce invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, making them less useful for evaluating or improving real-world toxicity content moderators. This paper proposes an annotation pipeline for quality control of generated toxic adversarial examples (TAE). We design model-based automated annotation and human-based quality verification to assess the quality requirements of TAE. Successful TAE should fool a target toxicity model into making benign predictions, be grammatically reasonable, appear natural like human-generated text, and exhibit semantic toxicity. When applying these requirements to more than 20 state-of-the-art (SOTA) TAE attack recipes, we find many invalid samples from a total of 940k raw TAE attack generations. We then utilize the proposed pipeline to filter and curate a high-quality TAE dataset we call TaeBench (of size 264k). Empirically, we demonstrate that TaeBench can effectively transfer-attack SOTA toxicity content moderation models and services. Our experiments also show that TaeBench with adversarial training achieve significant improvements of the robustness of two toxicity detectors.

Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) is an elegant approach to solve linear optimization problems, naturally described using integer decision variables. Within the context of physics-inspired machine learning applied to chemistry, we demonstrate the relevance of an ILP formulation to select molecular training sets for predictions of size-extensive properties. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised training set selection approaches, especially when predicting properties of molecules larger than those present in the training set. We argue that the reason for the improved performance is due to the selection that is based on the notion of local similarity (i.e., per-atom) and a unique ILP approach that finds optimal solutions efficiently. Altogether, this work provides a practical algorithm to improve the performance of physics-inspired machine learning models and offers insights into the conceptual differences with existing training set selection approaches.

Abstract: Rooted in the explosion of deep learning over the past decade, this thesis spans from AlphaGo to ChatGPT to empirically examine the fundamental concepts needed to realize the vision of an artificial scientist: a machine with the capacity to autonomously generate original research and contribute to the expansion of human knowledge. The investigation begins with Olivaw, an AlphaGo Zero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is unable to communicate it. This realization leads to the development of the Explanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a scientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective EL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a popular board game simulating the scientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an artificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used to explain its findings, and not rely on a rigid existing interpreter. Questioning the very process of learning an interpreter, we turn our attention to the inner functioning of modern multimodal models. This culminates in a simple idea to build CLIP-like models where interpretation and perception are explicitly disentangled: a cost-effective approach that couples two unimodal models using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we discuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial scientists, and introduce the Big-Bench Symbol Interpretation Task, a benchmark about interpreting Zendo-like explanations that sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully solved by humans.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles, necessitating a revolutionary architecture to support the growing demands for computational power. Cloud computing has become the driving force behind this transformation. However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.

<title>Generating Traffic Scenarios via In-Context Learning to Learn Better Motion Planner</title>

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a rigorous mathematical framework that enables robots to simultaneously detect unsafe states and generate actions that prevent future failures. While in theory, HJ reachability can synthesize safe controllers for nonlinear systems and nonconvex constraints, in practice, it has been limited to hand-engineered collision-avoidance constraints modeled via low-dimensional state-space representations and first-principles dynamics. In this work, our goal is to generalize safe robot controllers to prevent failures that are hard--if not impossible--to write down by hand, but can be intuitively identified from high-dimensional observations: for example, spilling the contents of a bag. We propose Latent Safety Filters, a latent-space generalization of HJ reachability that tractably operates directly on raw observation data (e.g., RGB images) to automatically compute safety-preserving actions without explicit recovery demonstrations by performing safety analysis in the latent embedding space of a generative world model. Our method leverages diverse robot observation-action data of varying quality (including successes, random exploration, and unsafe demonstrations) to learn a world model. Constraint specification is then transformed into a classification problem in the latent space of the learned world model. In simulation and hardware experiments, we compute an approximation of Latent Safety Filters to safeguard arbitrary policies (from imitation- learned policies to direct teleoperation) from complex safety hazards, like preventing a Franka Research 3 manipulator from spilling the contents of a bag or toppling cluttered objects.

Abstract: Existing information retrieval systems are largely constrained by their reliance on vector inner products to assess query-document relevance, which naturally limits the expressiveness of the relevance score they can produce. We propose a new paradigm; instead of representing a query as a vector, we use a small neural network that acts as a learned query-specific relevance function. This small neural network takes a document representation as input (in this work we use a single vector) and produces a scalar relevance score. To produce the small neural network we use a hypernetwork, a network that produces the weights of other networks, as our query encoder. We name this category of encoder models Hypencoders. Experiments on in-domain search tasks show that Hypencoders significantly outperform strong dense retrieval models and even surpass reranking models and retrieval models with an order of magnitude more parameters. To assess the extent of Hypencoders' capabilities, we evaluate on a set of hard retrieval tasks including tip-of-the-tongue and instruction-following retrieval tasks. On harder tasks, we find that the performance gap widens substantially compared to standard retrieval tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practicality of our method, we implement an approximate search algorithm and show that our model is able to retrieve from a corpus of 8.8M documents in under 60 milliseconds.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence seamlessly integrates vision, language, and action.~However, most multimodal robotic models rely on massive fine-tuning, incurring high time and hardware costs.~To address this, we introduce RoboBERT, an end-to-end multimodal manipulation model built around a novel two-stage training paradigm.~In the first stage, we freeze most of the vision encoder and train with a single "standard" instruction phrasing, allowing the model to focus on stable policy learning via a CNN-based diffusion policy.~In the second stage, we unfreeze all modules and inject diverse natural language variants, rapidly aligning varied instructions to the already-learned policy without destabilizing performance.~We further employ systematic data augmentations to enhance robustness against visual perturbations.~Without relying on auxiliary datasets, RoboBERT achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) mean episode lengths of 4.52 on the CALVIN ABCD-D benchmark and 3.79 on the ABC-D benchmark using only language-labeled expert demonstrations and a comparatively lightweight architecture.Real-robot trials on a 6-DOF manipulator confirm higher success rates than comparable methods trained on identical data.These results demonstrate that our data-augmentation-enhanced two-stage training paradigm delivers efficient, scalable, and broadly applicable performance for multimodal robotic systems.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of biological systems is fundamental to deciphering cellular behavior, developmental processes, and disease progression. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided static snapshots of gene expression, offering valuable insights into cellular states at a single time point. Recent advancements in temporally resolved scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and time-series spatial transcriptomics (temporal-ST) have further revolutionized our ability to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual cells. These technologies, when combined with computational frameworks such as Markov chains, stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and generative models like optimal transport and Schr\"odinger bridges, enable the reconstruction of dynamic cellular trajectories and cell fate decisions. This review discusses how these dynamical system approaches offer new opportunities to model and infer cellular dynamics from a systematic perspective.

Summary:<br /><br />Deep learning workloads often run on GPUs, and new quantization techniques require specialized matrix multiplication operators with mixed data types. Existing compilers like Triton struggle to optimize these operators effectively, while low-level programming models are labor-intensive to use. To address this gap, Hexcute is introduced as a tile-based programming language that enables fine-grained optimization for these complex operators. Hexcute exposes shared memory and register abstractions and leverages task mapping to schedule GPU programs efficiently. It also automates layout and task mapping synthesis using a novel algorithm based on type inference. Evaluation results demonstrate that Hexcute performs exceptionally well, achieving significant speedups compared to existing compilers for mixed-type operators and delivering notable improvements in overall performance. <div>

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.

<div> Transformers, compositional reasoning, generalization ability, few-shot learning, causal graph <br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces a learning task called FTCT to test Transformers' ability to integrate knowledge fragments. It demonstrates that Transformers can perform compositional reasoning by connecting fragments from separate sources to deduce relationships. The model successfully infers complete causal graph traces during testing, even when such combinations were not present in the training data. The research highlights the importance of few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting in enabling Transformers to showcase their compositional reasoning skills. It is noted that the model's ability to perform compositional reasoning is linked to its complexity and the similarity between training and testing data. The study suggests that Transformers learn a generalizable program during training, allowing them to effectively reason compositionally during testing. <div>

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable compositional reasoning by integrating knowledge from various sources. For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, "FTCT" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.

<div> Evolution, learning, neural networks, language, connectome
Summary:
This study introduces a novel framework for artificial neural networks that incorporates both evolution and individual learning processes. By incorporating an "outer loop" of evolution that shapes the "inner loop" of learning, artificial networks can better simulate the effects of both processes observed in biological organisms. The researchers trained a model in language tasks that inherited a "model connectome" from the evolutionary loop before exposure to a large dataset. Results showed that the connectome model outperformed or matched closely related control models on natural language processing tasks, human behavior alignment, and brain data alignment. This suggests that using a model connectome as a prior for learning can improve performance in low-data situations, bridging the gap between single-generation artificial models and biologically evolved neural networks. <div>

Abstract: Biological neural networks are shaped both by evolution across generations and by individual learning within an organism's lifetime, whereas standard artificial neural networks undergo a single, large training procedure without inherited constraints. In this preliminary work, we propose a framework that incorporates this crucial generational dimension - an "outer loop" of evolution that shapes the "inner loop" of learning - so that artificial networks better mirror the effects of evolution and individual learning in biological organisms. Focusing on language, we train a model that inherits a "model connectome" from the outer evolution loop before exposing it to a developmental-scale corpus of 100M tokens. Compared with two closely matched control models, we show that the connectome model performs better or on par on natural language processing tasks as well as alignment to human behavior and brain data. These findings suggest that a model connectome serves as an efficient prior for learning in low-data regimes - narrowing the gap between single-generation artificial models and biologically evolved neural networks.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new method for inducing disalignment in large language models (LLMs) by identifying and modifying neurons that regulate safety constraints. The proposed approach involves three main steps: analyzing neuron activations to detect critical ones for distinguishing harmful and harmless inputs, identifying responsible neurons based on similarity, and fine-tuning these neurons to remove safety constraints. Experimental results show that the method effectively removes safety constraints with minimal adjustments, revealing a vulnerability in current alignment techniques. The study emphasizes the importance of developing robust defenses against adversarial fine-tuning attacks on LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is achieved through fine-tuning mechanisms that regulate neuron activations to suppress harmful content. In this work, we propose a novel approach to induce disalignment by identifying and modifying the neurons responsible for safety constraints. Our method consists of three key steps: Neuron Activation Analysis, where we examine activation patterns in response to harmful and harmless prompts to detect neurons that are critical for distinguishing between harmful and harmless inputs; Similarity-Based Neuron Identification, which systematically locates the neurons responsible for safe alignment; and Neuron Relearning for Safety Removal, where we fine-tune these selected neurons to restore the model's ability to generate previously restricted responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively removes safety constraints with minimal fine-tuning, highlighting a critical vulnerability in current alignment techniques. Our findings underscore the need for robust defenses against adversarial fine-tuning attacks on LLMs.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between end-to-end measurement and SNR for deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders. The ABG formula is applicable for image reconstruction and inference tasks, fitting commonly used DL networks like SCUNet and Vision Transformer. It shows that the upper bound of MS-SSIM for image reconstruction depends on the quantized output bits of semantic encoders, with a proposed closed-form expression to describe this relationship. An adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over fading channels is investigated, ensuring QoS and optimizing energy efficiency. The paper also presents an optimal power allocation scheme for maximizing energy efficiency in the semantic communication system, and a bisection algorithm based power allocation scheme to enhance QoS for multiple users in OFDMA downlink semantic communication. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Due to the black-box characteristics of deep learning based semantic encoders and decoders, finding a tractable method for the performance analysis of semantic communications is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) formula to model the relationship between the end-to-end measurement and SNR, which can be applied for both image reconstruction tasks and inference tasks. Specifically, for image reconstruction tasks, the proposed ABG formula can well fit the commonly used DL networks, such as SCUNet, and Vision Transformer, for semantic encoding with the multi scale-structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM) measurement. Furthermore, we find that the upper bound of the MS-SSIM depends on the number of quantized output bits of semantic encoders, and we also propose a closed-form expression to fit the relationship between the MS-SSIM and quantized output bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical expression between end-to-end performance metrics and SNR for semantic communications. Based on the proposed ABG formula, we investigate an adaptive power control scheme for semantic communications over random fading channels, which can effectively guarantee quality of service (QoS) for semantic communications, and then design the optimal power allocation scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the semantic communication system. Furthermore, by exploiting the bisection algorithm, we develop the power allocation scheme to maximize the minimum QoS of multiple users for OFDMA downlink semantic communication Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed ABG formula and power allocation schemes.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, block chain, causal inference, economic analysis, Hamiltonian dynamics

Summary:
The article introduces the Hamiltonian Higher Order Elasticity Dynamics (2HOED) framework, which combines machine learning, block chain technology, and causal inference to analyze complex systems. 2HOED represents systems as energy-based Hamiltonians, incorporating variables such as position, velocity, acceleration, and elasticity. This framework is versatile and can be applied to various disciplines, from financial markets to epidemiology. By embedding econometric variables in a Hamiltonian, 2HOED enhances economic analysis by revealing resilience, tipping points, and feedback loops. The method offers insights into system behavior, enabling decision-makers to anticipate crises and design adaptive policies. Utilizing wavelet spectra, phase space attractors, and topological persistence diagrams, 2HOED uncovers multistage policy leverage for proactive decision-making. This approach bridges the gap between biological or mechanical elasticity and macro-level outcomes, providing a new causal energetic channel for understanding complex systems. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning detects patterns, block chain guarantees trust and immutability, and modern causal inference identifies directional linkages, yet none alone exposes the full energetic anatomy of complex systems; the Hamiltonian Higher Order Elasticity Dynamics(2HOED) framework bridges these gaps. Grounded in classical mechanics but extended to Economics order elasticity terms, 2HOED represents economic, social, and physical systems as energy-based Hamiltonians whose position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk of elasticity jointly determine systemic power, Inertia, policy sensitivity, and marginal responses. Because the formalism is scaling free and coordinate agnostic, it transfers seamlessly from financial markets to climate science, from supply chain logistics to epidemiology, thus any discipline in which adaptation and shocks coexist. By embedding standard econometric variables inside a Hamiltonian, 2HOED enriches conventional economic analysis with rigorous diagnostics of resilience, tipping points, and feedback loops, revealing failure modes invisible to linear models. Wavelet spectra, phase space attractors, and topological persistence diagrams derived from 2HOED expose multistage policy leverage that machine learning detects only empirically and block chain secures only after the fact. For economists, physicians and other scientists, the method opens a new causal energetic channel linking biological or mechanical elasticity to macro level outcomes. Portable, interpretable, and computationally light, 2HOED turns data streams into dynamical energy maps, empowering decision makers to anticipate crises, design adaptive policies, and engineer robust systems delivering the predictive punch of AI with the explanatory clarity of physics.

<div> Keywords: Federated Domain Generalization, Prompt Learning, Mixture of Experts, Token-level Prompt, Parameter-free Routing

Summary: 

TRIP is a framework for Federated Domain Generalization that leverages token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing. It addresses the limitations of existing models by assigning different tokens within an image to specific prompt experts, improving specialization. The framework ensures communication efficiency by utilizing token clustering and optimal transport for routing. TRIP synthesizes an instance-specific prompt by aggregating experts based on the number of tokens assigned to each. It also introduces an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts, harnessing the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate TRIP's effectiveness in achieving optimal generalization results while only requiring communication of 1K parameters per round. The code for TRIP is publicly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated domain generalization (FedDG) aims to learn a globally generalizable model from decentralized clients with heterogeneous data while preserving privacy. Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt. However, such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to performance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of experts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing MoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high communication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations, we propose TRIP, a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing framework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike existing image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an image to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP incorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and optimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by aggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each. Additionally, TRIP develops an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts, leveraging the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that TRIP achieves optimal generalization results, with communication of only 1K parameters per round.

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data-driven approaches for depression diagnosis have emerged as a significant research focus in neuromedicine, driven by the development of relevant datasets. Recently, graph neural network (GNN)-based models have gained widespread adoption due to their ability to capture brain channel functional connectivity from both spatial and temporal perspectives. However, their effectiveness is hindered by the absence of a robust temporal biomarker. In this paper, we introduce a novel and effective biomarker for depression diagnosis by leveraging the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose a customized graph network architecture based on Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN). Our model was trained on a dataset comprising 1,086 subjects, which is over 10 times larger than previous datasets in the field of depression diagnosis. Furthermore, to align with medical requirements, we performed propensity score matching (PSM) to create a refined subset, referred to as the PSM dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating our newly designed biomarker enhances the representation of temporal characteristics in brain channels, leading to improved F1 scores in both the real-world dataset and the PSM dataset. This advancement has the potential to contribute to the development of more effective depression diagnostic tools. In addition, we used SHapley Additive exPlaination (SHAP) to validate the interpretability of our model, ensuring its practical applicability in medical settings.

Abstract: Molecular optimization, aimed at improving binding affinity or other molecular properties, is a crucial task in drug discovery that often relies on the expertise of medicinal chemists. Recently, deep learning-based 3D generative models showed promise in enhancing the efficiency of molecular optimization. However, these models often struggle to adequately consider binding affinities with protein targets during lead optimization. Herein, we propose a 3D pocket-aware and affinity-guided diffusion model, named Diffleop, to optimize molecules with enhanced binding affinity. The model explicitly incorporates the knowledge of protein-ligand binding affinity to guide the denoising sampling for molecule generation with high affinity. The comprehensive evaluations indicated that Diffleop outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, especially in terms of binding affinity.

Summary:
The study focuses on training and deploying deepfake detection models on edge devices to maintain data privacy. To overcome limited computational resources at the edge, compression techniques like pruning and quantization, alongside transfer learning methods, are explored. Experimental results show that high compression levels of 90% can be achieved without sacrificing performance when training and validation data come from the same DeepFake model. However, a domain generalization issue arises when testing data is generated by DeepFake models not seen during training. This highlights the need for addressing domain generalization challenges in deepfake detection on edge devices through effective compression and transfer learning techniques.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training and deploying deepfake detection models on edge devices offers the advantage of maintaining data privacy and confidentiality by processing it close to its source. However, this approach is constrained by the limited computational and memory resources available at the edge. To address this challenge, we explore compression techniques to reduce computational demands and inference time, alongside transfer learning methods to minimize training overhead. Using the Synthbuster, RAISE, and ForenSynths datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of pruning, knowledge distillation (KD), quantization, fine-tuning, and adapter-based techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate that both compression and transfer learning can be effectively achieved, even with a high compression level of 90%, remaining at the same performance level when the training and validation data originate from the same DeepFake model. However, when the testing dataset is generated by DeepFake models not present in the training set, a domain generalization issue becomes evident.

Abstract: The random vector functional link (RVFL) neural network has shown significant potential in overcoming the constraints of traditional artificial neural networks, such as excessive computation time and suboptimal solutions. However, RVFL faces challenges when dealing with noise and outliers, as it assumes all data samples contribute equally. To address this issue, we propose a novel robust framework, R2VFL, RVFL with Huber weighting function and class probability, which enhances the model's robustness and adaptability by effectively mitigating the impact of noise and outliers in the training data. The Huber weighting function reduces the influence of outliers, while the class probability mechanism assigns less weight to noisy data points, resulting in a more resilient model. We explore two distinct approaches for calculating class centers within the R2VFL framework: the simple average of all data points in each class and the median of each feature, the later providing a robust alternative by minimizing the effect of extreme values. These approaches give rise to two novel variants of the model-R2VFL-A and R2VFL-M. We extensively evaluate the proposed models on 47 UCI datasets, encompassing both binary and multiclass datasets, and conduct rigorous statistical testing, which confirms the superiority of the proposed models. Notably, the models also demonstrate exceptional performance in classifying EEG signals, highlighting their practical applicability in real-world biomedical domain.

Summary:<br />
Foundation models have transformed artificial intelligence, but fine-tuning for specific tasks can be computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods aim to update only a subset of parameters to reduce computational costs. This survey explores the integration of PEFT techniques in federated learning settings, categorizing approaches into Additive, Selective, and Reparameterized PEFT. Each category addresses challenges like data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and privacy in FL. The literature is organized based on application domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Promising research directions include scaling to large models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments. <div>

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by providing robust, versatile architectures pre-trained on large-scale datasets. However, adapting these massive models to specific downstream tasks requires fine-tuning, which can be prohibitively expensive in computational resources. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by selectively updating only a small subset of parameters. Meanwhile, Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the integration of PEFT techniques within federated learning environments. We systematically categorize existing approaches into three main groups: Additive PEFT (which introduces new trainable parameters), Selective PEFT (which fine-tunes only subsets of existing parameters), and Reparameterized PEFT (which transforms model architectures to enable efficient updates). For each category, we analyze how these methods address the unique challenges of federated settings, including data heterogeneity, communication efficiency, computational constraints, and privacy concerns. We further organize the literature based on application domains, covering both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. Finally, we discuss promising research directions, including scaling to larger foundation models, theoretical analysis of federated PEFT methods, and sustainable approaches for resource-constrained environments.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced regression refers to prediction tasks where the target variable is skewed. This skewness hinders machine learning models, especially neural networks, which concentrate on dense regions and therefore perform poorly on underrepresented (minority) samples. Despite the importance of this problem, only a few methods have been proposed for imbalanced regression. Many of the available solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class imbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian noise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the underlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently, these approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent the true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose SMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression. In Stage 1, an existing oversampler generates initial synthetic samples in sparse target regions. In Stage 2, we introduce DistGAN, a distribution-aware GAN that serves as SMOGAN's filtering layer and refines these samples via adversarial loss augmented with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy objective, aligning them with the true joint feature-target distribution. Extensive experiments on 23 imbalanced datasets show that SMOGAN consistently outperforms the default oversampling method without the DistGAN filtering layer.

arXiv:2504.21174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning drives a new wave in computing systems and triggers the automation of increasingly complex problems. In particular, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced cognitive tasks, often matching or even surpassing human-level performance. However, their extensive parameters result in high computational costs and slow inference, posing challenges for deployment in resource-limited settings. Among the strategies to overcome the aforementioned challenges, pruning emerges as a successful mechanism since it reduces model size while maintaining predictive ability. In this paper, we introduce AMP: Attention Heads and MLP Pruning, a novel structured pruning method that efficiently compresses LLMs by removing less critical structures within Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). By projecting the input data onto weights, AMP assesses structural importance and overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, which often fall short in flexibility or efficiency. In particular, AMP surpasses the current state-of-the-art on commonsense reasoning tasks by up to 1.49 percentage points, achieving a 30% pruning ratio with minimal impact on zero-shot task performance. Moreover, AMP also improves inference speeds, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We confirm the flexibility of AMP on different families of LLMs, including LLaMA and Phi.

In the vision and text domains, zero-shot OOD detection - which requires no training on in-distribution (ID) data - has made significant progress through the use of large-scale pretrained models such as vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs). However, zero-shot OOD detection in graph-structured data remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by complex relational structures and the absence of powerful, large-scale pretrained models for graphs. In this work, we take the first step toward enabling zero-shot graph OOD detection by leveraging a graph foundation model (GFM). We show that, when provided only with class label names, the GFM can perform OOD detection without any node-level supervision - outperforming existing supervised methods across multiple datasets. To address the more practical setting where OOD label names are unavailable, we introduce GLIP-OOD, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate semantically informative pseudo-OOD labels from unlabeled data. These labels enable the GFM to capture nuanced semantic boundaries between ID and OOD classes and perform fine-grained OOD detection - without requiring any labeled nodes. Our approach is the first to enable node-level graph OOD detection in a fully zero-shot setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark text-attributed graph datasets.

<div> FPGAs, HLS tools, LIFT, large language model, coding assistant <br />
Summary: <br />
FPGAs are gaining popularity in datacenters for their reconfigurability and energy efficiency. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have simplified FPGA programming by allowing developers to work at a higher level of abstraction. However, achieving high performance still requires expert knowledge and manual optimization. To address this challenge, LIFT, a coding assistant powered by a large language model (LLM) and a graph neural network (GNN), automatically generates performance-critical pragmas for C/C++ designs. Through the integration of LLM and GNN, LIFT outperforms existing tools like AutoDSE and HARP, improving performance by up to 3.52x. Additionally, LIFT's designs are 66x faster than those generated by GPT-4o. This innovative approach enables developers to enhance FPGA performance without the need for extensive manual optimization. <br /> <div>

Abstract: FPGAs are increasingly adopted in datacenter environments for their reconfigurability and energy efficiency. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have eased FPGA programming by raising the abstraction level from RTL to untimed C/C++, yet attaining high performance still demands expert knowledge and iterative manual insertion of optimization pragmas to modify the microarchitecture. To address this challenge, we propose LIFT, a large language model (LLM)-based coding assistant for HLS that automatically generates performance-critical pragmas given a C/C++ design. We fine-tune the LLM by tightly integrating and supervising the training process with a graph neural network (GNN), combining the sequential modeling capabilities of LLMs with the structural and semantic understanding of GNNs necessary for reasoning over code and its control/data dependencies. On average, LIFT produces designs that improve performance by 3.52x and 2.16x than prior state-of the art AutoDSE and HARP respectively, and 66x than GPT-4o.

Summary:
Tensor-Trained Low-Rank Adaptation Mixture of Experts (TT-LoRA MoE) is a new computational framework that combines Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with sparse MoE routing to address scalability issues in large model deployments. This approach involves training lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts) independently for specific tasks and then freezing them to prevent interference and forgetting in multi-task scenarios. A sparse MoE router is trained separately to dynamically select the appropriate adapter for each input at inference time. The architecture retains memory efficiency, scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. It uses a small fraction of parameters compared to other methods and outperforms existing techniques in multi-tasking, making it practical and scalable for multi-task inference deployments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose Tensor-Trained Low-Rank Adaptation Mixture of Experts (TT-LoRA MoE), a novel computational framework integrating Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with sparse MoE routing to address scalability challenges in large model deployments. Unlike traditional MoE approaches, which face substantial computational overhead as expert counts grow, TT-LoRA MoE decomposes training into two distinct, optimized stages. First, we independently train lightweight, tensorized low-rank adapters (TT-LoRA experts), each specialized for specific tasks. Subsequently, these expert adapters remain frozen, eliminating inter-task interference and catastrophic forgetting in multi-task setting. A sparse MoE router, trained separately, dynamically leverages base model representations to select exactly one specialized adapter per input at inference time, automating expert selection without explicit task specification. Comprehensive experiments confirm our architecture retains the memory efficiency of low-rank adapters, seamlessly scales to large expert pools, and achieves robust task-level optimization. This structured decoupling significantly enhances computational efficiency and flexibility: uses only 2% of LoRA, 0.3% of Adapters and 0.03% of AdapterFusion parameters and outperforms AdapterFusion by 4 value in multi-tasking, enabling practical and scalable multi-task inference deployments.

<div> Keywords: out-of-distribution detection, graph, large language models, OOD exposure, synthetic OOD nodes <br />
Summary: 
GOE-LLM introduces a novel framework for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graphs without requiring real OOD nodes. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance detection performance by introducing pseudo-OOD nodes and generating synthetic OOD nodes. The framework consists of two pipelines: identifying pseudo-OOD nodes from unlabeled graphs using LLM annotations and generating informative synthetic OOD nodes through LLM-prompted text generation. By using these pseudo-OOD nodes for training, the ID classifier is better able to detect OOD data. Experimental evaluations on various benchmark datasets show that GOE-LLM outperforms existing graph OOD detection methods that do not utilize OOD exposure and achieves comparable performance to those relying on real OOD data. This approach addresses the challenge of acquiring representative OOD samples, making it a practical and effective solution for enhancing model robustness in OOD detection for graphs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in graphs is critical for ensuring model robustness in open-world and safety-sensitive applications. Existing approaches to graph OOD detection typically involve training an in-distribution (ID) classifier using only ID data, followed by the application of post-hoc OOD scoring techniques. Although OOD exposure - introducing auxiliary OOD samples during training - has proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing detection performance, current methods in the graph domain generally assume access to a set of real OOD nodes. This assumption, however, is often impractical due to the difficulty and cost of acquiring representative OOD samples. In this paper, we introduce GOE-LLM, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for OOD exposure in graph OOD detection without requiring real OOD nodes. GOE-LLM introduces two pipelines: (1) identifying pseudo-OOD nodes from the initially unlabeled graph using zero-shot LLM annotations, and (2) generating semantically informative synthetic OOD nodes via LLM-prompted text generation. These pseudo-OOD nodes are then used to regularize the training of the ID classifier for improved OOD awareness. We evaluate our approach across multiple benchmark datasets, showing that GOE-LLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph OOD detection methods that do not use OOD exposure and achieves comparable performance to those relying on real OOD data.

<div> Federated Graph Learning, Graph neural networks, Data privacy, Heterophily, FedHERO <br />
Summary: <br />
Federated Graph Learning (FGL) enables collaborative training of Graph neural networks (GNNs) while maintaining data privacy. Existing FGL methods assume homophilic graph data across clients, leading to consistent knowledge learning. However, varying neighbor distribution patterns (heterophily) across client graphs can result in conflicting knowledge when aggregating local models. To address this, FedHERO is proposed, utilizing a dual-channel GNN with a structure learner to extract universal structural knowledge. This allows individual client models to leverage local and shared insights and handle graphs with diverse neighbor distribution patterns effectively. Extensive experiments validate FedHERO's superior performance compared to existing methods. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) empowers clients to collaboratively train Graph neural networks (GNNs) in a distributed manner while preserving data privacy. However, FGL methods usually require that the graph data owned by all clients is homophilic to ensure similar neighbor distribution patterns of nodes. Such an assumption ensures that the learned knowledge is consistent across the local models from all clients. Therefore, these local models can be properly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall performance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes vary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different levels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict knowledge from their node-level predictive tasks. Consequently, aggregating these local models usually leads to catastrophic performance deterioration on the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FedHERO, an FGL framework designed to harness and share insights from heterophilic graphs effectively. At the heart of FedHERO is a dual-channel GNN equipped with a structure learner, engineered to discern the structural knowledge encoded in the local graphs. With this specialized component, FedHERO enables the local model for each client to identify and learn patterns that are universally applicable across graphs with different patterns of node neighbor distributions. FedHERO not only enhances the performance of individual client models by leveraging both local and shared structural insights but also sets a new precedent in this field to effectively handle graph data with various node neighbor distribution patterns. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the superior performance of FedHERO against existing alternatives.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the ongoing issue of wildlife trafficking, exacerbated by the prevalence of e-commerce platforms which make it easier to sell illicit wildlife products. It highlights the challenge of identifying wildlife-related ads among the vast array of online marketplace listings. To address this, the paper proposes a cost-effective strategy that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of data, subsequently creating specialized classification models. The method aims to automate the process of gathering diverse ad samples and minimize labeling costs. Experimental results show that the classifiers developed using this approach outperform LLMs in terms of F1 score, at a lower cost. Real use cases demonstrate how this method enables analysis of various aspects of wildlife trafficking. <div>
arXiv:2504.21211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildlife trafficking remains a critical global issue, significantly impacting biodiversity, ecological stability, and public health. Despite efforts to combat this illicit trade, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier to sell wildlife products, putting new pressure on wild populations of endangered and threatened species. The use of these platforms also opens a new opportunity: as criminals sell wildlife products online, they leave digital traces of their activity that can provide insights into trafficking activities as well as how they can be disrupted. The challenge lies in finding these traces. Online marketplaces publish ads for a plethora of products, and identifying ads for wildlife-related products is like finding a needle in a haystack. Learning classifiers can automate ad identification, but creating them requires costly, time-consuming data labeling that hinders support for diverse ads and research questions. This paper addresses a critical challenge in the data science pipeline for wildlife trafficking analytics: generating quality labeled data for classifiers that select relevant data. While large language models (LLMs) can directly label advertisements, doing so at scale is prohibitively expensive. We propose a cost-effective strategy that leverages LLMs to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of the data and uses these labels to create specialized classification models. Our novel method automatically gathers diverse and representative samples to be labeled while minimizing the labeling costs. Our experimental evaluation shows that our classifiers achieve up to 95% F1 score, outperforming LLMs at a lower cost. We present real use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling analyses of different aspects of wildlife trafficking.

Abstract: Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to provide robust and generalizable representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors investigate causal discovery in a multi-domain scenario where causal functions remain consistent across domains while exogenous noise distribution may vary. They demonstrate that with causal sufficiency and the presence of bijective generation mechanisms (BGM), causal diagrams can be discovered with less strict functional assumptions. BGM, encompassing various models such as additive noise, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear, and location-scale noise models, ensures that the functional relationship between exogenous noise and the endogenous variable is bijective and differentiable for every level of the cause variable. Additionally, the study presents a statistical test for determining the parents set of the target variable. Through experiments on diverse datasets, both synthetic and real-world, the theoretical findings are validated, emphasizing the effectiveness of BGM in enabling causal discovery in multi-domain settings. <div>
arXiv:2504.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of causal discovery (a.k.a., causal structure learning) in a multi-domain setting. We assume that the causal functions are invariant across the domains, while the distribution of the exogenous noise may vary. Under causal sufficiency (i.e., no confounders exist), we show that the causal diagram can be discovered under less restrictive functional assumptions compared to previous work. What enables causal discovery in this setting is bijective generation mechanisms (BGM), which ensures that the functional relation between the exogenous noise $E$ and the endogenous variable $Y$ is bijective and differentiable in both directions at every level of the cause variable $X = x$. BGM generalizes a variety of models including additive noise model, LiNGAM, post-nonlinear model, and location-scale noise model. Further, we derive a statistical test to find the parents set of the target variable. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.

Summary: 
The proposed orthogonal factor-based biclustering algorithm (BCBOF) addresses limitations faced by traditional biclustering algorithms when processing high-dimensional data. By constructing orthogonal factors and performing clustering in an orthogonal subspace, BCBOF effectively reduces data sparsity and preserves critical local structural patterns. The algorithm was applied to stock technical indicators and stock price trend prediction, generating fuzzy rules for trading signals. BCBOF outperformed existing biclustering methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. In virtual trading experiments using historical data from 10 A-share stocks, the fuzzy inference system generated higher returns for investors. <div>
arXiv:2504.21289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biclustering is an effective technique in data mining and pattern recognition. Biclustering algorithms based on traditional clustering face two fundamental limitations when processing high-dimensional data: (1) The distance concentration phenomenon in high-dimensional spaces leads to data sparsity, rendering similarity measures ineffective; (2) Mainstream linear dimensionality reduction methods disrupt critical local structural patterns. To apply biclustering to high-dimensional datasets, we propose an orthogonal factor-based biclustering algorithm (BCBOF). First, we constructed orthogonal factors in the vector space of the high-dimensional dataset. Then, we performed clustering using the coordinates of the original data in the orthogonal subspace as clustering targets. Finally, we obtained biclustering results of the original dataset. Since dimensionality reduction was applied before clustering, the proposed algorithm effectively mitigated the data sparsity problem caused by high dimensionality. Additionally, we applied this biclustering algorithm to stock technical indicator combinations and stock price trend prediction. Biclustering results were transformed into fuzzy rules, and we incorporated profit-preserving and stop-loss rules into the rule set, ultimately forming a fuzzy inference system for stock price trend predictions and trading signals. To evaluate the performance of BCBOF, we compared it with existing biclustering methods using multiple evaluation metrics. The results showed that our algorithm outperformed other biclustering techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the fuzzy inference system, we conducted virtual trading experiments using historical data from 10 A-share stocks. The experimental results showed that the generated trading strategies yielded higher returns for investors.

<div> Keywords: feature transformation, unsupervised learning, generator-critic framework, LLM agents, data readiness

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to feature transformation that aims to enhance data utility in domains with large dimensionality and limited labeled data availability. The proposed framework utilizes a generator-critic duet-play teaming strategy with LLM agents to derive pseudo-supervision from unsupervised data. The framework consists of three main steps: the critic agent diagnoses data to provide advice, the generator agent produces tokenized feature transformations guided by the critic's advice, and iterative refinement ensures continuous improvement through feedback between agents. This framework can also be extended to human-agent collaborative generation by involving human experts in the process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework surpasses supervised baselines in terms of efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability across various datasets. <div>
arXiv:2504.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature transformation involves generating a new set of features from the original dataset to enhance the data's utility. In certain domains like material performance screening, dimensionality is large and collecting labels is expensive and lengthy. It highly necessitates transforming feature spaces efficiently and without supervision to enhance data readiness and AI utility. However, existing methods fall short in efficient navigation of a vast space of feature combinations, and are mostly designed for supervised settings. To fill this gap, our unique perspective is to leverage a generator-critic duet-play teaming framework using LLM agents and in-context learning to derive pseudo-supervision from unsupervised data. The framework consists of three interconnected steps: (1) Critic agent diagnoses data to generate actionable advice, (2) Generator agent produces tokenized feature transformations guided by the critic's advice, and (3) Iterative refinement ensures continuous improvement through feedback between agents. The generator-critic framework can be generalized to human-agent collaborative generation, by replacing the critic agent with human experts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms even supervised baselines in feature transformation efficiency, robustness, and practical applicability across diverse datasets.

<div> Diffusion models, AR diffusion models, conditional dependence structures, sampling error, theoretical results <br />
Summary: <br />
The article explores the use of auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models to enhance the capture of conditional dependence structures in data. The study shows that AR diffusion models produce samples that better approximate the data conditional distribution compared to typical diffusion models. The AR variant also demonstrates practicality for large-scale applications, with only a moderate increase in inference time. Empirical results indicate that AR diffusion models effectively capture conditional dependence structures when present in the data, while vanilla DDPM models struggle in such cases. However, when no clear conditional dependence is observed across data patches, AR diffusion models do not outperform DDPM. This research offers insights into strengthening diffusion models to better represent high-level relationships in image and video generation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.21314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated appealing performance in both image and video generation. However, many works discover that they struggle to capture important, high-level relationships that are present in the real world. For example, they fail to learn physical laws from data, and even fail to understand that the objects in the world exist in a stable fashion. This is due to the fact that important conditional dependence structures are not adequately captured in the vanilla diffusion models. In this work, we initiate an in-depth study on strengthening the diffusion model to capture the conditional dependence structures in the data. In particular, we examine the efficacy of the auto-regressive (AR) diffusion models for such purpose and develop the first theoretical results on the sampling error of AR diffusion models under (possibly) the mildest data assumption. Our theoretical findings indicate that, compared with typical diffusion models, the AR variant produces samples with a reduced gap in approximating the data conditional distribution. On the other hand, the overall inference time of the AR-diffusion models is only moderately larger than that for the vanilla diffusion models, making them still practical for large scale applications. We also provide empirical results showing that when there is clear conditional dependence structure in the data, the AR diffusion models captures such structure, whereas vanilla DDPM fails to do so. On the other hand, when there is no obvious conditional dependence across patches of the data, AR diffusion does not outperform DDPM.

<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a new approach called action decomposed reinforcement learning to address the challenges posed by discrete factored action spaces in practical reinforcement learning environments. By leveraging a lower dimensional projected subspace of the original action space, the proposed method aims to improve sample complexity by approximating the Q-function in standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. The approach ensures unbiasedness of decomposed Q-functions using causal effect estimation techniques from causal statistics, particularly in the no unobserved confounder setting. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in improving sample efficiency in both online continuous control environments and a real-world offline sepsis treatment environment. By considering the structure of the action space and utilizing projected Q-functions, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various settings. <div>

Abstract: Many practical reinforcement learning environments have a discrete factored action space that induces a large combinatorial set of actions, thereby posing significant challenges. Existing approaches leverage the regular structure of the action space and resort to a linear decomposition of Q-functions, which avoids enumerating all combinations of factored actions. In this paper, we consider Q-functions defined over a lower dimensional projected subspace of the original action space, and study the condition for the unbiasedness of decomposed Q-functions using causal effect estimation from the no unobserved confounder setting in causal statistics. This leads to a general scheme which we call action decomposed reinforcement learning that uses the projected Q-functions to approximate the Q-function in standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed approach is shown to improve sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate improvements in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines in online continuous control environments and a real-world offline sepsis treatment environment.

<div> Keywords: meta federated learning, personalized variant, fine-tuning steps, convergence analysis, real-world datasets<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new approach called meta federated learning, a personalized version of federated learning where agents collaborate without sharing raw data. The goal is to train a shared initial model that can be easily adapted to local datasets through fine-tuning. Unlike conventional methods that focus on minimizing average loss after one fine-tuning step, this approach considers multiple fine-tuning steps to better accommodate heterogeneous data distributions across agents. A variant of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm is proposed, with theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating faster convergence and improved accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. <div>
arXiv:2504.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta federated learning (FL) is a personalized variant of FL, where multiple agents collaborate on training an initial shared model without exchanging raw data samples. The initial model should be trained in a way that current or new agents can easily adapt it to their local datasets after one or a few fine-tuning steps, thus improving the model personalization. Conventional meta FL approaches minimize the average loss of agents on the local models obtained after one step of fine-tuning. In practice, agents may need to apply several fine-tuning steps to adapt the global model to their local data, especially under highly heterogeneous data distributions across agents. To this end, we present a generalized framework for the meta FL by minimizing the average loss of agents on their local model after any arbitrary number $\nu$ of fine-tuning steps. For this generalized framework, we present a variant of the well-known federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm and conduct a comprehensive theoretical convergence analysis to characterize the convergence speed as well as behavior of the meta loss functions in both the exact and approximated cases. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate superior accuracy and faster convergence for the proposed scheme compared to conventional approaches.

<div> Neural Networks, Physics-Informed, PDEs, Multi-grid Method, Transfer Learning <br />
Summary: <br />
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving PDEs but face challenges with stiff and high-frequency problems. A new approach inspired by the multi-grid method aims to address these issues. By training with different levels of samples, the method effectively reduces frequency errors, improving accuracy without needing complex adjustments to neural network structures or hyperparameters. Testing on 1D ODE and 2D convection-diffusion equations demonstrates the approach's efficacy. Application to Lid-driven cavity flows at varying Reynolds numbers showcases significant accuracy improvements of 30% to 60%. Synergies with transfer learning techniques further enhance predictions, even for complex high-frequency PDEs such as Re=5000. The study highlights the potential of this method for solving challenging problems in physics and computer science. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks have emerged as a promising methodology for solving PDEs, gaining significant attention in computer science and various physics-related fields. Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.

Summary: 
The study introduces a lightweight generative modeling framework for Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction, balancing computational efficiency, interpretability, and predictive accuracy. By utilizing Vector Quantization (VQ) as a preprocessing technique, continuous network features are transformed into discrete categorical symbols, facilitating integration with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for temporal sequence modeling.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing resource management and enhancing user satisfaction across both telecommunication and OTT services. While recent advances predominantly rely on deep learning models, this study introduces a lightweight generative modeling framework that balances computational efficiency, interpretability, and predictive accuracy. By validating the use of Vector Quantization (VQ) as a preprocessing technique, continuous network features are effectively transformed into discrete categorical symbols, enabling integration with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for temporal sequence modeling. This VQ-HMM pipeline enhances the model's capacity to capture dynamic QoE patterns while supporting probabilistic inference on new and unseen data. Experimental results on publicly available time-series datasets incorporating both objective indicators and subjective QoE scores demonstrate the viability of this approach in real-time and resource-constrained environments, where inference latency is also critical. The framework offers a scalable alternative to complex deep learning methods, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources or where latency constraints are critical.

<br />
Summary:<br />
This study compares various Machine Learning methods for long-term traffic forecasting, considering up to 30-day horizons on real-world datasets. While Deep Learning models like RNN and Transformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies, the importance shifts towards periodicity modeling over time. Time embedding enhances RNN performance significantly compared to Transformer in long-term forecasting. XGBoost, despite using only time features, competes well with Deep Learning methods. Factors like input sequence length, holiday traffic, data granularity, and training data size are also considered. These findings provide insights for improving AI's learning capabilities in long-term traffic forecasting scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2504.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems, for which Machine Learning (ML) methods have been extensively explored to develop data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. Recent research focuses on modelling spatial-temporal correlations for short-term traffic prediction, leaving the favourable long-term forecasting a challenging and open issue. This paper presents a comparative study on large-scale real-world signalized arterials and freeway traffic flow datasets, aiming to evaluate promising ML methods in the context of large forecasting horizons up to 30 days. Focusing on modelling capacity for temporal dynamics, we develop one ensemble ML method, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and a range of Deep Learning (DL) methods, including Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based methods and the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method. Time embedding is leveraged to enhance their understanding of seasonality and event factors. Experimental results highlight that while the attention mechanism/Transformer framework is effective for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, as the forecasting horizon extends, the key to effective traffic forecasting gradually shifts from temporal dependency capturing to periodicity modelling. Time embedding is particularly effective in this context, helping naive RNN outperform Informer by 31.1% for 30-day-ahead forecasting. Meanwhile, as an efficient and robust model, XGBoost, while learning solely from time features, performs competitively with DL methods. Moreover, we investigate the impacts of various factors like input sequence length, holiday traffic, data granularity, and training data size. The findings offer valuable insights and serve as a reference for future long-term traffic forecasting research and the improvement of AI's corresponding learning capabilities.

Summary:<br />
Multi-modal representation learning is essential in artificial intelligence, and the Synergy-CLIP framework extends CLIP to integrate visual, textual, and audio modalities equally. Unlike previous approaches, Synergy-CLIP captures latent information across all modalities. A new triple-modal dataset, VGG-sound+, provides balanced data for training. Synergy-CLIP excels in zero-shot classification tasks compared to existing methods. It also showcases its capability in a missing modality reconstruction task, demonstrating synergy among modalities in practical applications. These advancements lay a solid foundation for further exploration in multi-modal representation learning. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.21375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal representation learning has become a pivotal area in artificial intelligence, enabling the integration of diverse modalities such as vision, text, and audio to solve complex problems. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on bimodal interactions, such as image-text pairs, which limits their ability to fully exploit the richness of multi-modal data. Furthermore, the integration of modalities in equal-scale environments remains underexplored due to the challenges of constructing large-scale, balanced datasets. In this study, we propose Synergy-CLIP, a novel framework that extends the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) architecture to enhance multi-modal representation learning by integrating visual, textual, and audio modalities. Unlike existing methods that focus on adapting individual modalities to vanilla-CLIP, Synergy-CLIP aligns and captures latent information across three modalities equally. To address the high cost of constructing large-scale multi-modal datasets, we introduce VGG-sound+, a triple-modal dataset designed to provide equal-scale representation of visual, textual, and audio data. Synergy-CLIP is validated on various downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, where it outperforms existing baselines. Additionally, we introduce a missing modality reconstruction task, demonstrating Synergy-CLIP's ability to extract synergy among modalities in realistic application scenarios. These contributions provide a robust foundation for advancing multi-modal representation learning and exploring new research directions.

Summary: 
This paper introduces the concept of sparse-to-sparse training in diffusion models (DMs) to improve training and inference efficiency in generative models. The researchers trained sparse DMs from scratch on various datasets using different methods and found that sparse DMs could match or even outperform their dense counterparts while reducing the number of parameters and floating point operations. By studying the effect of sparsity on model performance, the experiments highlighted safe and effective values for implementing sparse-to-sparse training in DMs. The results show that sparse DMs offer a promising approach to achieving high-quality sample generation with lower computational resources in tasks such as image synthesis, natural language processing, and temporal data modeling. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful type of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image synthesis tasks and have shown potential in other domains, such as natural language processing and temporal data modeling. Despite their stable training dynamics and ability to produce diverse high-quality samples, DMs are notorious for requiring significant computational resources, both in the training and inference stages. Previous work has focused mostly on increasing the efficiency of model inference. This paper introduces, for the first time, the paradigm of sparse-to-sparse training to DMs, with the aim of improving both training and inference efficiency. We focus on unconditional generation and train sparse DMs from scratch (Latent Diffusion and ChiroDiff) on six datasets using three different methods (Static-DM, RigL-DM, and MagRan-DM) to study the effect of sparsity in model performance. Our experiments show that sparse DMs are able to match and often outperform their Dense counterparts, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and FLOPs. We also identify safe and effective values to perform sparse-to-sparse training of DMs.

Summary:<br />Recent advancements in offline reinforcement learning have focused on addressing overestimation of Q-values for out-of-distribution actions. High stakes applications like recommendation systems in online gaming face challenges due to player psychology and platform volatility. Current methods struggle with learning from sparse and overlapping state spaces across policies. FAST-Q introduces Gradient Reversal Learning to balance state representations, enabling counterfactual estimation. It supports offline exploration alongside static data exploitation and includes a Q-value decomposition strategy for multi-objective optimization. FAST-Q outperforms previous methods, leading to increased player returns, improved lifetime value and engagement, longer platform dwell time, and reduced recommendation costs by 10% on a volatile gaming platform. <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) offline reinforcement learning (RL) have primarily focused on addressing function approximation errors, which contribute to the overestimation of Q-values for out-of-distribution actions, a challenge that static datasets exacerbate. However, high stakes applications such as recommendation systems in online gaming, introduce further complexities due to player's psychology (intent) driven by gameplay experiences and the inherent volatility on the platform. These factors create highly sparse, partially overlapping state spaces across policies, further influenced by the experiment path selection logic which biases state spaces towards specific policies. Current SOTA methods constrain learning from such offline data by clipping known counterfactual actions as out-of-distribution due to poor generalization across unobserved states. Further aggravating conservative Q-learning and necessitating more online exploration. FAST-Q introduces a novel approach that (1) leverages Gradient Reversal Learning to construct balanced state representations, regularizing the policy-specific bias between the player's state and action thereby enabling counterfactual estimation; (2) supports offline counterfactual exploration in parallel with static data exploitation; and (3) proposes a Q-value decomposition strategy for multi-objective optimization, facilitating explainable recommendations over short and long-term objectives. These innovations demonstrate superiority of FAST-Q over prior SOTA approaches and demonstrates at least 0.15 percent increase in player returns, 2 percent improvement in lifetime value (LTV), 0.4 percent enhancement in the recommendation driven engagement, 2 percent improvement in the player's platform dwell time and an impressive 10 percent reduction in the costs associated with the recommendation, on our volatile gaming platform.

Abstract: In tackling frequent anomalies in stamping processes, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised in-process anomaly monitoring framework, utilizing accelerometer signals and physics information, to capture the process anomaly effectively. The proposed framework facilitates the construction of a monitoring model with imbalanced sample distribution, which enables in-process condition monitoring in real-time to prevent batch anomalies, which helps to reduce batch defects risk and enhance production yield. Firstly, to effectively capture key features from raw data containing redundant information, a hybrid feature extraction algorithm is proposed to utilize data-driven methods and physical mechanisms simultaneously. Secondly, to address the challenge brought by imbalanced sample distribution, a semi-supervised anomaly detection model is established, which merely employs normal samples to build a golden baseline model, and a novel deviation score is proposed to quantify the anomaly level of each online stamping stroke. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is validated with various classification algorithms. A real-world in-process dataset from stamping manufacturing workshop is employed to illustrate the superiority of proposed semi-supervised framework with enhance performance for process anomaly monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate classification of EEG signals is crucial for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetic applications, yet many existing methods fail to account for the non-Euclidean, manifold structure of EEG data, resulting in suboptimal performance.

To this end, we propose MPEC (Manifold-Preserved EEG Classification via an Ensemble of Clustering-Based Classifiers), that introduces two key innovations: (1) a feature engineering phase that combines covariance matrices and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels to capture both linear and non-linear relationships among EEG channels, and (2) a clustering phase that employs a modified K-means algorithm tailored for the Riemannian manifold space, ensuring local geometric sensitivity.

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative training of a global model across multiple geographically dispersed clients without the need for data sharing. However, it is susceptible to inference attacks, particularly label inference attacks.
  Existing studies on label distribution inference exhibits sensitive to the specific settings of the victim client and typically underperforms under defensive strategies. In this study, we propose a novel label distribution inference attack that is stable and adaptable to various scenarios. Specifically, we estimate the size of the victim client's dataset and construct several virtual clients tailored to the victim client. We then quantify the temporal generalization of each class label for the virtual clients and utilize the variation in temporal generalization to train an inference model that predicts the label distribution proportions of the victim client.
  We validate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, FER2013, and AG-News. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our attack remains effective even under differential privacy defense mechanisms, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.

Summary:<br /> 
A new neural network, xEEGNet, is introduced for EEG data analysis focusing on classifying Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia versus controls. xEEGNet is compact, explainable, and fully interpretable with major parameter reduction to reduce overfitting. The model is derived from ShallowNet and modified for increased transparency without sacrificing performance, using only 168 parameters. Robust cross-validation confirms xEEGNet's comparable performance to larger models. Variability across data splits is explained by EEG representations, showing higher accuracy in separating controls and Alzheimer's cases. The model's ability to filter EEG bands, learn topographies, and use spectral features demonstrates its interpretability. This study highlights the effectiveness of smaller architectures like xEEGNet in EEG pathology classification, challenging the notion that larger models are always superior in performance. <div>
arXiv:2504.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents xEEGNet, a novel, compact, and explainable neural network for EEG data analysis. It is fully interpretable and reduces overfitting through major parameter reduction. As an applicative use case, we focused on classifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological conditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a simple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and gradually modified to move from a "black box" to a more transparent model, without compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined from a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants, including ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance estimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG representations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to quantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through training-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168 parameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability, resists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and reduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded EEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between test set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from training data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn band-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its interpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for performance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally effective in EEG pathology classification.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel optimization framework for least squares learning problems in fully connected neural networks and physics-informed neural networks. Traditional gradient descent methods can be inefficient in deep learning due to the non-convexity of loss functions and the vanishing gradient issue.

Summary:
The article proposes a proactive self-adaptive approach for AI models deployed in non-stationary environments, particularly in medical settings where temporal dataset shifts are common. The approach involves modeling the temporal trajectory of AI parameters using polynomial spline bases within a Functional Data Analysis framework. By short-term forecasting parameter values, the approach addresses prior probability shift, covariate shift, and concept shift. Validation on simulated and real-world COVID-19 datasets from Mexico shows that the pro-adaptive approach enhances AI performance against shifts compared to baseline models trained at different time distances.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deployed in production frequently face challenges in maintaining their performance in non-stationary environments. This issue is particularly noticeable in medical settings, where temporal dataset shifts often occur. These shifts arise when the distributions of training data differ from those of the data encountered during deployment over time. Further, new labeled data to continuously retrain AI is not typically available in a timely manner due to data access limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a proactive self-adaptive AI approach, or pro-adaptive, where we model the temporal trajectory of AI parameters, allowing us to short-term forecast parameter values. To this end, we use polynomial spline bases, within an extensible Functional Data Analysis framework. We validate our methodology with a logistic regression model addressing prior probability shift, covariate shift, and concept shift. This validation is conducted on both a controlled simulated dataset and a publicly available real-world COVID-19 dataset from Mexico, with various shifts occurring between 2020 and 2024. Our results indicate that this approach enhances the performance of AI against shifts compared to baseline stable models trained at different time distances from the present, without requiring updated training data. This work lays the foundation for pro-adaptive AI research against dynamic, non-stationary environments, being compatible with data protection, in resilient AI production environments for health.

Abstract: The Forward-Forward algorithm has evolved in machine learning research, tackling more complex tasks that mimic real-life applications. In the last years, it has been improved by several techniques to perform better than its original version, handling a challenging dataset like CIFAR10 without losing its flexibility and low memory usage. We have shown in our results that improvements are achieved through a combination of convolutional channel grouping, learning rate schedules, and independent block structures during training that lead to a 20\% decrease in test error percentage. Additionally, to approach further implementations on low-capacity hardware projects we have presented a series of lighter models that achieve low test error percentages within (21$\pm$6)\% and number of trainable parameters between 164,706 and 754,386. This serving also as a basis for our future study on complete verification and validation of these kinds of neural networks.

Summary: 
The article proposes a novel approach called Recursive KL Divergence Optimization (RKDO) that generalizes representation learning objectives by reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized conditional distributions. This dynamic formalism captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction methods while offering stability and local adaptation. Experiment results show that RKDO offers efficiency advantages, with approximately 30% lower loss values compared to static approaches across different datasets and a 60 to 80% reduction in computational resources needed for similar results. The recursive updating mechanism of RKDO creates a more efficient optimization landscape for representation learning, with significant implications for resource-constrained applications. <div>

Abstract: We propose a generalization of modern representation learning objectives by reframing them as recursive divergence alignment processes over localized conditional distributions While recent frameworks like Information Contrastive Learning I-Con unify multiple learning paradigms through KL divergence between fixed neighborhood conditionals we argue this view underplays a crucial recursive structure inherent in the learning process. We introduce Recursive KL Divergence Optimization RKDO a dynamic formalism where representation learning is framed as the evolution of KL divergences across data neighborhoods. This formulation captures contrastive clustering and dimensionality reduction methods as static slices while offering a new path to model stability and local adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that RKDO offers dual efficiency advantages approximately 30 percent lower loss values compared to static approaches across three different datasets and 60 to 80 percent reduction in computational resources needed to achieve comparable results. This suggests that RKDOs recursive updating mechanism provides a fundamentally more efficient optimization landscape for representation learning with significant implications for resource constrained applications.

<div> Hypernet, Federated learning, Performance-fairness trade-offs, Local Pareto front, Preference sampling

Summary: 
HetPFL is a novel approach in federated learning that aims to handle the performance-fairness trade-offs by effectively learning both local and global Pareto fronts. The proposed method, comprising Preference Sampling Adaptation (PSA) and Preference-aware Hypernet Fusion (PHF), addresses the limitations of existing methods by adaptively determining optimal preference sampling distributions for each client to accommodate heterogeneous local Pareto fronts, and performing preference-aware fusion of clients' hypernets to ensure the performance of the global Pareto front. HetPFL is proven to converge linearly with respect to the number of rounds, under weaker assumptions than existing methods. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that HetPFL outperforms seven baselines in terms of the quality of learned local and global Pareto fronts. <div>

Abstract: Recent methods leverage a hypernet to handle the performance-fairness trade-offs in federated learning. This hypernet maps the clients' preferences between model performance and fairness to preference-specifc models on the trade-off curve, known as local Pareto front. However, existing methods typically adopt a uniform preference sampling distribution to train the hypernet across clients, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of their local Pareto fronts. Meanwhile, from the perspective of generalization, they do not consider the gap between local and global Pareto fronts on the global dataset. To address these limitations, we propose HetPFL to effectively learn both local and global Pareto fronts. HetPFL comprises Preference Sampling Adaptation (PSA) and Preference-aware Hypernet Fusion (PHF). PSA adaptively determines the optimal preference sampling distribution for each client to accommodate heterogeneous local Pareto fronts. While PHF performs preference-aware fusion of clients' hypernets to ensure the performance of the global Pareto front. We prove that HetPFL converges linearly with respect to the number of rounds, under weaker assumptions than existing methods. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that HetPFL significantly outperforms seven baselines in terms of the quality of learned local and global Pareto fronts.

Summary: 
This paper introduces whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering. The algorithms consider split and merge events of line segments to analyze object movement history. Whole-trajectory clustering examines entire entities' trajectories, while sub-trajectory clustering identifies similar sub-trajectories using a sliding window model. The stable trajectory clustering algorithm selectively omits temporary anomalies to preserve clustering patterns and improve stability and interpretability. By running these algorithms on real trajectory datasets, the study demonstrates their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations. <div>

Abstract: Clustering algorithms group data points by characteristics to identify patterns. Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.

Abstract: This study examines the digital value chain in automotive manufacturing, focusing on the identification, software flashing, customization, and commissioning of electronic control units in vehicle networks. A novel precedence graph design is proposed to optimize this process chain using an automated scheduling algorithm that employs mixed integer linear programming techniques. The results show significant improvements in key metrics. The algorithm reduces the number of production stations equipped with expensive hardware and software to execute digital value chain processes, while increasing capacity utilization through efficient scheduling and reduced idle time. Task parallelization is optimized, resulting in streamlined workflows and increased throughput. Compared to the traditional method, the automated approach has reduced preparation time by 50% and reduced scheduling activities, as it now takes two minutes to create the precedence graph. The flexibility of the algorithm's constraints allows for vehicle-specific configurations while maintaining high responsiveness, eliminating backup stations and facilitating the integration of new topologies. Automated scheduling significantly outperforms manual methods in efficiency, functionality, and adaptability.

Summary: 
AI supply chains have become common in the development of AI products, involving various actors contributing models and datasets. The historical perspective reveals a shift towards specialization and outsourcing in the AI industry. Modeling AI supply chains as directed graphs helps in understanding complex issues. The case studies highlight challenges such as imperfect information passing along supply chains leading to misunderstandings with real-world consequences, and upstream design choices impacting downstream AI products. These findings emphasize the need for further research on AI supply chains to address social, economic, regulatory, and technical implications.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI in recent years has led to the emergence of AI supply chains: complex networks of AI actors contributing models, datasets, and more to the development of AI products and services. AI supply chains have many implications yet are poorly understood. In this work, we take a first step toward a formal study of AI supply chains and their implications, providing two illustrative case studies indicating that both AI development and regulation are complicated in the presence of supply chains. We begin by presenting a brief historical perspective on AI supply chains, discussing how their rise reflects a longstanding shift towards specialization and outsourcing that signals the healthy growth of the AI industry. We then model AI supply chains as directed graphs and demonstrate the power of this abstraction by connecting examples of AI issues to graph properties. Finally, we examine two case studies in detail, providing theoretical and empirical results in both. In the first, we show that information passing (specifically, of explanations) along the AI supply chains is imperfect, which can result in misunderstandings that have real-world implications. In the second, we show that upstream design choices (e.g., by base model providers) have downstream consequences (e.g., on AI products fine-tuned on the base model). Together, our findings motivate further study of AI supply chains and their increasingly salient social, economic, regulatory, and technical implications.

Abstract: After two years of appearance, COVID-19 has negatively affected people and normal life around the world. As in May 2022, there are more than 522 million cases and six million deaths worldwide (including nearly ten million cases and over forty-three thousand deaths in Vietnam). Economy and society are both severely affected. The variant of COVID-19, Omicron, has broken disease prevention measures of countries and rapidly increased number of infections. Resources overloading in treatment and epidemics prevention is happening all over the world. It can be seen that, application of artificial intelligence (AI) to support people at this time is extremely necessary. There have been many studies applying AI to prevent COVID-19 which are extremely useful, and studies on machine reading comprehension (MRC) are also in it. Realizing that, we created the first MRC dataset about COVID-19 for Vietnamese: ViQA-COVID and can be used to build models and systems, contributing to disease prevention. Besides, ViQA-COVID is also the first multi-span extraction MRC dataset for Vietnamese, we hope that it can contribute to promoting MRC studies in Vietnamese and multilingual.

Summary:
HYPEROFA addresses the suboptimal performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on mid- and low-resource languages by introducing a hypernetwork-based approach for adaptive token embedding initialization. Unlike OFA, which restricts target-language token embeddings to convex combinations of source-language embeddings, HYPEROFA allows for more flexible embeddings. The hypernetwork is trained to map from a multilingual word vector space to the PLMs token embedding space using source-language tokens. Experiments show that HYPEROFA outperforms random initialization and matches or exceeds OFA in continual pre-training convergence and downstream task performance. The code for HYPEROFA is publicly available. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Many pre-trained language models (PLMs) exhibit suboptimal performance on mid- and low-resource languages, largely due to limited exposure to these languages during pre-training. A common strategy to address this is to introduce new tokens specific to the target languages, initialize their embeddings, and apply continual pre-training on target-language data. Among such methods, OFA (Liu et al., 2024a) proposes a similarity-based subword embedding initialization heuristic that is both effective and efficient. However, OFA restricts target-language token embeddings to be convex combinations of a fixed number of source-language embeddings, which may limit expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose HYPEROFA, a hypernetwork-based approach for more adaptive token embedding initialization. The hypernetwork is trained to map from an external multilingual word vector space to the PLMs token embedding space using source-language tokens. Once trained, it can generate flexible embeddings for target-language tokens, serving as a good starting point for continual pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that HYPEROFA consistently outperforms random initialization baseline and matches or exceeds the performance of OFA in both continual pre-training convergence and downstream task performance. We make the code publicly available.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, generating high-quality text that balances coherence, diversity, and relevance remains challenging. Traditional decoding methods, such as bean search and top-k sampling, often struggle with either repetitive or incoherent outputs, particularly in tasks that require long-form text generation. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel enhancement of the well-known Contrastive Search algorithm, Context-Enhanced Contrastive Search (CECS) with contextual calibration. The proposed scheme introduces several novelties including dynamic contextual importance weighting, multi-level Contrastive Search, and adaptive temperature control, to optimize the balance between fluency, creativity, and precision. The performance of CECS is evaluated using several standard metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and semantic similarity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both coherence and relevance of the generated texts by CECS outperforming the existing Contrastive Search techniques. The proposed algorithm has several potential applications in the real world including legal document drafting, customer service chatbots, and content marketing.

Abstract: Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) has become a prevalent specification language for robotic tasks. To mitigate the significant manual effort and expertise required to define LTL-encoded tasks, several methods have been proposed for translating Natural Language (NL) instructions into LTL formulas, which, however, lack correctness guarantees. To address this, we introduce a new NL-to-LTL translation method, called ConformalNL2LTL, that can achieve user-defined translation success rates over unseen NL commands. Our method constructs LTL formulas iteratively by addressing a sequence of open-vocabulary Question-Answering (QA) problems with LLMs. To enable uncertainty-aware translation, we leverage conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool for black-box models. CP enables our method to assess the uncertainty in LLM-generated answers, allowing it to proceed with translation when sufficiently confident and request help otherwise. We provide both theoretical and empirical results demonstrating that ConformalNL2LTL achieves user-specified translation accuracy while minimizing help rates.

<title>Param$\Delta$ for Direct Weight Mixing: Post-Train Large Language Model at Zero Cost</title>

Abstract: The post-training phase of large language models is essential for enhancing capabilities such as instruction-following, reasoning, and alignment with human preferences. However, it demands extensive high-quality data and poses risks like overfitting, alongside significant computational costs due to repeated post-training and evaluation after each base model update. This paper introduces $Param\Delta$, a novel method that streamlines post-training by transferring knowledge from an existing post-trained model to a newly updated base model with ZERO additional training. By computing the difference between post-trained model weights ($\Theta_\text{post}$) and base model weights ($\Theta_\text{base}$), and adding this to the updated base model ($\Theta'_\text{base}$), we define $Param\Delta$ Model as: $\Theta_{\text{Param}\Delta} = \Theta_\text{post} - \Theta_\text{base} + \Theta'_\text{base}$. This approach surprisingly equips the new base model with post-trained capabilities, achieving performance comparable to direct post-training. We did analysis on LLama3, Llama3.1, Qwen, and DeepSeek-distilled models. Results indicate $Param\Delta$ Model effectively replicates traditional post-training. For example, the $Param\Delta$ Model obtained from 70B Llama3-inst, Llama3-base, Llama3.1-base models attains approximately 95\% of Llama3.1-inst model's performance on average. $Param\Delta$ brings a new perspective on how to fully leverage models in the open-weight community, where checkpoints for base and instruct models are readily available and frequently updated, by providing a cost-free framework to accelerate the iterative cycle of model development.

Abstract: With the growing presence of multilingual users on social media, detecting abusive language in code-mixed text has become increasingly challenging. Code-mixed communication, where users seamlessly switch between English and their native languages, poses difficulties for traditional abuse detection models, as offensive content may be context-dependent or obscured by linguistic blending. While abusive language detection has been extensively explored for high-resource languages like English and Hindi, low-resource languages such as Telugu and Nepali remain underrepresented, leaving gaps in effective moderation. In this study, we introduce a novel, manually annotated dataset of 2 thousand Telugu-English and 5 Nepali-English code-mixed comments, categorized as abusive and non-abusive, collected from various social media platforms. The dataset undergoes rigorous preprocessing before being evaluated across multiple Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Large Language Models (LLMs). We experimented with models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), LSTM, CNN, and LLMs, optimizing their performance through hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate it using 10-fold cross-validation and statistical significance testing (t-test). Our findings provide key insights into the challenges of detecting abusive language in code-mixed settings and offer a comparative analysis of computational approaches. This study contributes to advancing NLP for low-resource languages by establishing benchmarks for abusive language detection in Telugu-English and Nepali-English code-mixed text. The dataset and insights can aid in the development of more robust moderation strategies for multilingual social media environments.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of malware variants requires robust classification methods to enhance cybersecurity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for generating malware descriptions to aid family classification, their utility is limited by semantic embedding overlaps and misalignment with binary behavioral features. We propose a contrastive fine-tuning (CFT) method that refines LLM embeddings via targeted selection of hard negative samples based on cosine similarity, enabling LLMs to distinguish between closely related malware families. Our approach combines high-similarity negatives to enhance discriminative power and mid-tier negatives to increase embedding diversity, optimizing both precision and generalization. Evaluated on the CIC-AndMal-2020 and BODMAS datasets, our refined embeddings are integrated into a multimodal classifier within a Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework on a few-shot setting. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements: our method achieves 63.15% classification accuracy with as few as 20 samples on CIC-AndMal-2020, outperforming baselines by 11--21 percentage points and surpassing prior negative sampling strategies. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of similarity-based selection over random sampling, with gains of 10-23%. Additionally, fine-tuned LLMs generate attribute-aware descriptions that generalize to unseen variants, bridging textual and binary feature gaps. This work advances malware classification by enabling nuanced semantic distinctions and provides a scalable framework for adapting LLMs to cybersecurity challenges.

Abstract: The perceived quality of the explanations accompanying e-government services is key to gaining trust in these institutions, consequently amplifying further usage of these services. Recent advances in generative AI, and concretely in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the automation of such content articulations, eliciting explanations' interpretability and fidelity, and more generally, adapting content to various audiences. However, selecting the right LLM type for this has become a non-trivial task for e-government service providers. In this work, we adapted a previously developed scale to assist with this selection, providing a systematic approach for the comparative analysis of the perceived quality of explanations generated by various LLMs. We further demonstrated its applicability through the tax-return process, using it as an exemplar use case that could benefit from employing an LLM to generate explanations about tax refund decisions. This was attained through a user study with 128 survey respondents who were asked to rate different versions of LLM-generated explanations about tax refund decisions, providing a methodological basis for selecting the most appropriate LLM. Recognizing the practical challenges of conducting such a survey, we also began exploring the automation of this process by attempting to replicate human feedback using a selection of cutting-edge predictive techniques.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management. To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents' lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agents contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, balancing security and performance consideration. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.

<title>A False Sense of Privacy: Evaluating Textual Data Sanitization Beyond Surface-level Privacy Leakage</title>

Abstract: Sanitizing sensitive text data typically involves removing personally identifiable information (PII) or generating synthetic data under the assumption that these methods adequately protect privacy; however, their effectiveness is often only assessed by measuring the leakage of explicit identifiers but ignoring nuanced textual markers that can lead to re-identification. We challenge the above illusion of privacy by proposing a new framework that evaluates re-identification attacks to quantify individual privacy risks upon data release. Our approach shows that seemingly innocuous auxiliary information -- such as routine social activities -- can be used to infer sensitive attributes like age or substance use history from sanitized data. For instance, we demonstrate that Azure's commercial PII removal tool fails to protect 74\% of information in the MedQA dataset. Although differential privacy mitigates these risks to some extent, it significantly reduces the utility of the sanitized text for downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that current sanitization techniques offer a \textit{false sense of privacy}, highlighting the need for more robust methods that protect against semantic-level information leakage.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become an essential strategy for adapting them to specialized tasks; however, this process introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive training data may be inadvertently memorized and exposed. Although differential privacy (DP) offers strong theoretical guarantees against such leakage, its empirical privacy effectiveness on LLMs remains unclear, especially under different fine-tuning methods. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of DP across fine-tuning methods and privacy budgets, using both data extraction and membership inference attacks to assess empirical privacy risks. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Differential privacy reduces model utility, but its impact varies significantly across different fine-tuning methods. (2) Without DP, the privacy risks of models fine-tuned with different approaches differ considerably. (3) When DP is applied, even a relatively high privacy budget can substantially lower privacy risk. (4) The privacy-utility trade-off under DP training differs greatly among fine-tuning methods, with some methods being unsuitable for DP due to severe utility degradation. Our results provide practical guidance for privacy-conscious deployment of LLMs and pave the way for future research on optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off in fine-tuning methodologies.

Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.

<title>Erased but Not Forgotten: How Backdoors Compromise Concept Erasure</title>

Abstract: The expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised growing concerns about their potential to generate undesirable or harmful content, ranging from fabricated depictions of public figures to sexually explicit images. To mitigate these risks, prior work has devised machine unlearning techniques that attempt to erase unwanted concepts through fine-tuning. However, in this paper, we introduce a new threat model, Toxic Erasure (ToxE), and demonstrate how recent unlearning algorithms, including those explicitly designed for robustness, can be circumvented through targeted backdoor attacks. The threat is realized by establishing a link between a trigger and the undesired content. Subsequent unlearning attempts fail to erase this link, allowing adversaries to produce harmful content. We instantiate ToxE via two established backdoor attacks: one targeting the text encoder and another manipulating the cross-attention layers. Further, we introduce Deep Intervention Score-based Attack (DISA), a novel, deeper backdoor attack that optimizes the entire U-Net using a score-based objective, improving the attack's persistence across different erasure methods. We evaluate five recent concept erasure methods against our threat model. For celebrity identity erasure, our deep attack circumvents erasure with up to 82% success, averaging 57% across all erasure methods. For explicit content erasure, ToxE attacks can elicit up to 9 times more exposed body parts, with DISA yielding an average increase by a factor of 2.9. These results highlight a critical security gap in current unlearning strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated the capability to generate human like, natural responses across a range of tasks, including task oriented dialogue and question answering. However, their application in real world, critical scenarios is often hindered by a tendency to produce inaccurate information and a limited ability to leverage external knowledge sources. This paper introduces the LLM ENHANCER system, designed to integrate multiple online sources such as Google, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo to enhance data accuracy. The LLMs employed within this system are open source. The data acquisition process for the LLM ENHANCER system operates in parallel, utilizing custom agent tools to manage the flow of information. Vector embeddings are used to identify the most pertinent information, which is subsequently supplied to the LLM for user interaction. The LLM ENHANCER system mitigates hallucinations in chat based LLMs while preserving response naturalness and accuracy.

Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is one of the promising variational approaches of quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In QAOA, variational parameters need to be optimized by solving a series of nonlinear, nonconvex optimization programs. In this work, we propose a QAOA parameter transfer scheme using Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to solve Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems. We prepare optimized parameters for graphs of 12 and 14 vertices and use GATs to transfer their parameters to larger graphs. Additionally, we design a hybrid distributed resource-aware algorithm for MIS (HyDRA-MIS), which decomposes large problems into smaller ones that can fit onto noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We integrate our GAT-based parameter transfer approach to HyDRA-MIS and demonstrate competitive results compared to KaMIS, a state-of-the-art classical MIS solver, on graphs with several thousands vertices.

Abstract: Continually retraining models has emerged as a primary technique to enable high-accuracy video analytics on edge devices. Yet, existing systems employ such adaptation by relying on the spare compute resources that traditional (memory-constrained) edge servers afford. In contrast, mobile edge devices such as drones and dashcams offer a fundamentally different resource profile: weak(er) compute with abundant unified memory pools. We present Legilimens, a continuous learning system for the mobile edge's System-on-Chip GPUs. Our driving insight is that visually distinct scenes that require retraining exhibit substantial overlap in model embeddings; if captured into a base model on device memory, specializing to each new scene can become lightweight, requiring very few samples. To practically realize this approach, Legilimens presents new, compute-efficient techniques to (1) select high-utility data samples for retraining specialized models, (2) update the base model without complete retraining, and (3) time-share compute resources between retraining and live inference for maximal accuracy. Across diverse workloads, Legilimens lowers retraining costs by 2.8-10x compared to existing systems, resulting in 18-45% higher accuracies.

Abstract: Privacy in federated learning is crucial, encompassing two key aspects: safeguarding the privacy of clients' data and maintaining the privacy of the federator's objective from the clients. While the first aspect has been extensively studied, the second has received much less attention.
  We present a novel approach that addresses both concerns simultaneously, drawing inspiration from techniques in knowledge distillation and private information retrieval to provide strong information-theoretic privacy guarantees.
  Traditional private function computation methods could be used here; however, they are typically limited to linear or polynomial functions. To overcome these constraints, our approach unfolds in three stages. In stage 0, clients perform the necessary computations locally. In stage 1, these results are shared among the clients, and in stage 2, the federator retrieves its desired objective without compromising the privacy of the clients' data. The crux of the method is a carefully designed protocol that combines secret-sharing-based multi-party computation and a graph-based private information retrieval scheme. We show that our method outperforms existing tools from the literature when properly adapted to this setting.

Abstract: This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.

<title>Small or Large? Zero-Shot or Finetuned? Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare</title>

Abstract: This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.

Abstract: Extreme heat is the deadliest weather-related hazard in the United States. Furthermore, it is increasing in intensity, frequency, and duration, making skillful forecasts vital to protecting life and property. Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models struggle with extreme heat for medium-range and subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence-based weather prediction (AIWP) models are progressing rapidly. However, it is largely unknown how well AIWP models forecast extremes, especially for medium-range and S2S timescales. This study investigates 2-m temperature forecasts for 60 heat waves across the four boreal seasons and over four CONUS regions at lead times up to 20 days, using two AIWP models (Google GraphCast and Pangu-Weather) and one traditional NWP model (NOAA United Forecast System Global Ensemble Forecast System (UFS GEFS)). First, case study analyses show that both AIWP models and the UFS GEFS exhibit consistent cold biases on regional scales in the 5-10 days of lead time before heat wave onset. GraphCast is the more skillful AIWP model, outperforming UFS GEFS and Pangu-Weather in most locations. Next, the two AIWP models are isolated and analyzed across all heat waves and seasons, with events split among the model's testing (2018-2023) and training (1979-2017) periods. There are cold biases before and during the heat waves in both models and all seasons, except Pangu-Weather in winter, which exhibits a mean warm bias before heat wave onset. Overall, results offer encouragement that AIWP models may be useful for medium-range and S2S predictability of extreme heat.

Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing tabular data from aggregate statistics, in which the attacker aims to identify interesting claims about the sensitive data that can be verified with 100% certainty given the aggregates. Successful attempts in prior work have conducted studies in settings where the set of published statistics is rich enough that entire datasets can be reconstructed with certainty. In our work, we instead focus on the regime where many possible datasets match the published statistics, making it impossible to reconstruct the entire private dataset perfectly (i.e., when approaches in prior work fail). We propose the problem of partial data reconstruction, in which the goal of the adversary is to instead output a $\textit{subset}$ of rows and/or columns that are $\textit{guaranteed to be correct}$. We introduce a novel integer programming approach that first $\textbf{generates}$ a set of claims and then $\textbf{verifies}$ whether each claim holds for all possible datasets consistent with the published aggregates. We evaluate our approach on the housing-level microdata from the U.S. Decennial Census release, demonstrating that privacy violations can still persist even when information published about such data is relatively sparse.

Abstract: Artefacts compromise clinical decision-making in the use of medical time series. Pulsatile waveforms offer probabilities for accurate artefact detection, yet most approaches rely on supervised manners and overlook patient-level distribution shifts. To address these issues, we introduce a generalised label-free framework, GenClean, for real-time artefact cleaning and leverage an in-house dataset of 180,000 ten-second arterial blood pressure (ABP) samples for training. We first investigate patient-level generalisation, demonstrating robust performances under both intra- and inter-patient distribution shifts. We further validate its effectiveness through challenging cross-disease cohort experiments on the MIMIC-III database. Additionally, we extend our method to photoplethysmography (PPG), highlighting its applicability to diverse medical pulsatile signals. Finally, its integration into ICM+, a clinical research monitoring software, confirms the real-time feasibility of our framework, emphasising its practical utility in continuous physiological monitoring. This work provides a foundational step toward precision medicine in improving the reliability of high-resolution medical time series analysis

Abstract: Deep learning models have great potential in medical imaging, including orthodontics and skeletal maturity assessment. However, applying a model to data different from its training set can lead to unreliable predictions that may impact patient care. To address this, we propose a comprehensive verification framework that evaluates model suitability through multiple complementary strategies. First, we introduce a Gradient Attention Map (GAM)-based approach that analyzes attention patterns using Grad-CAM and compares them via similarity metrics such as IoU, Dice Similarity, SSIM, Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance. Second, we extend verification to early convolutional feature maps, capturing structural mis-alignments missed by attention alone. Finally, we incorporate an additional garbage class into the classification model to explicitly reject out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that these combined methods effectively identify unsuitable models and inputs, promoting safer and more reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: Neck ultrasound (US) plays a vital role in airway management by providing non-invasive, real-time imaging that enables rapid and precise interventions. Deep learning-based anatomical landmark detection in neck US can further facilitate procedural efficiency. However, class imbalance within datasets, where key structures like tracheal rings and vocal folds are underrepresented, presents significant challenges for object detection models. To address this, we propose T2ID-CAS, a hybrid approach that combines a text-to-image latent diffusion model with class-aware sampling to generate high-quality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes. This approach, rarely explored in the ultrasound domain, improves the representation of minority classes. Experimental results using YOLOv9 for anatomical landmark detection in neck US demonstrated that T2ID-CAS achieved a mean Average Precision of 88.2, significantly surpassing the baseline of 66. This highlights its potential as a computationally efficient and scalable solution for mitigating class imbalance in AI-assisted ultrasound-guided interventions.

Abstract: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is activated during stress, which can have negative effects on cardiovascular health, sleep, the immune system, and mental health. While there are ways to quantify ANS activity in laboratories, there is a paucity of methods that have been validated in real-world contexts. We present the Fitbit Body Response Algorithm, an approach to continuous remote measurement of ANS activation through widely available remote wrist-based sensors. The design was validated via two experiments, a Trier Social Stress Test (n = 45) and ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of perceived stress (n=87), providing both controlled and ecologically valid test data. Model performance predicting perceived stress when using all available sensor modalities was consistent with expectations (accuracy=0.85) and outperformed models with access to only a subset of the signals. We discuss and address challenges to sensing that arise in real world settings that do not present in conventional lab environments.

Abstract: Energy-efficient ventilation control plays a vital role in reducing building energy consumption while ensuring occupant health and comfort. While Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations offer high-fidelity modeling of airflow for building HVAC design, their high computational cost makes them impractical for practical adoption in real-time building management system. In this work, we present a data-driven framework that combines the physical accuracy of CFD with the computational efficiency of machine learning to enable energy-efficient building ventilation control. Our method jointly optimizes airflow supply rates and vent angles to reduce energy use and adhere to air quality constraints. We train a neural operator transformer to learn the mapping from building control actions to airflow field distributions using high-resolution CFD data. This learned operator enables a gradient-based control framework capable of optimal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial energy savings compared to maximum airflow rate control, rule-based control, and data-driven control based on regional average CO2 predictions, while consistently maintaining safe indoor air quality. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of our method for enabling safe and energy-efficient building management.

Methods like Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) are widely used but exhibit limitations, including systematic misclassification biases linked to socioeconomic status. This paper introduces LSTM+Geo, a novel approach enhancing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with census tract geolocation information. Using a large voter dataset, we demonstrate that LSTM+Geo (88.7% accuracy) significantly outperforms standalone LSTM (86.4%) and Bayesian methods like BISG (82.9%) and BIFSG (86.8%) in accuracy and F1-score on a held-out validation set. LSTM+Geo reduces the rate at which non-White individuals are misclassified as White (White FPR 19.3%) compared to name-only LSTMs (White FPR 24.6%). While sophisticated ensemble methods incorporating XGBoost achieve the highest overall accuracy (up to 89.4%) and lowest White FPR (17.8%), LSTM+Geo offers strong standalone performance with improved bias characteristics compared to baseline models. Integrating LSTM+Geo into an XGBoost ensemble further boosts accuracy, highlighting its utility as both a standalone model and a component for advanced systems. We give a caution at the end regarding the appropriate use of these methods.

Abstract: Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks. Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach. Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.

<title>Embracing Collaboration Over Competition: Condensing Multiple Prompts for Visual In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) enables adaptively solving vision tasks by leveraging pixel demonstrations, mimicking human-like task completion through analogy. Prompt selection is critical in VICL, but current methods assume the existence of a single "ideal" prompt in a pool of candidates, which in practice may not hold true. Multiple suitable prompts may exist, but individually they often fall short, leading to difficulties in selection and the exclusion of useful context. To address this, we propose a new perspective: prompt condensation. Rather than relying on a single prompt, candidate prompts collaborate to efficiently integrate informative contexts without sacrificing resolution. We devise Condenser, a lightweight external plugin that compresses relevant fine-grained context across multiple prompts. Optimized end-to-end with the backbone, Condenser ensures accurate integration of contextual cues. Experiments demonstrate Condenser outperforms state-of-the-arts across benchmark tasks, showing superior context compression, scalability with more prompts, and enhanced computational efficiency compared to ensemble methods, positioning it as a highly competitive solution for VICL. Code is open-sourced at https://github.com/gimpong/CVPR25-Condenser.

<title>Redundancy Analysis and Mitigation for Machine Learning-Based Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing</title>

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has significantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect detection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments.

<title>How to Backdoor the Knowledge Distillation</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has become a cornerstone in modern machine learning systems, celebrated for its ability to transfer knowledge from a large, complex teacher model to a more efficient student model. Traditionally, this process is regarded as secure, assuming the teacher model is clean. This belief stems from conventional backdoor attacks relying on poisoned training data with backdoor triggers and attacker-chosen labels, which are not involved in the distillation process. Instead, knowledge distillation uses the outputs of a clean teacher model to guide the student model, inherently preventing recognition or response to backdoor triggers as intended by an attacker. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by introducing a novel attack methodology that strategically poisons the distillation dataset with adversarial examples embedded with backdoor triggers. This technique allows for the stealthy compromise of the student model while maintaining the integrity of the teacher model. Our innovative approach represents the first successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within the knowledge distillation process using clean teacher models. Through extensive experiments conducted across various datasets and attack settings, we demonstrate the robustness, stealthiness, and effectiveness of our method. Our findings reveal previously unrecognized vulnerabilities and pave the way for future research aimed at securing knowledge distillation processes against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Black-box discrete optimization (BB-DO) problems arise in many real-world applications, such as neural architecture search and mathematical model estimation. A key challenge in BB-DO is epistasis among parameters where multiple variables must be modified simultaneously to effectively improve the objective function. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) provide a powerful framework for tackling BB-DO problems. In particular, an EDA leveraging a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has demonstrated strong performance on relatively low-dimensional problems with epistasis while reducing computational cost. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms such as DSMGA-II and P3, which integrate bit-flip-based local search with linkage learning, have shown excellent performance on high-dimensional problems. In this study, we propose a new memetic algorithm that combines VAE-based sampling with local search. The proposed method inherits the strengths of both VAE-based EDAs and local search-based approaches: it effectively handles high-dimensional problems with epistasis among parameters without incurring excessive computational overhead. Experiments on NK landscapes -- a challenging benchmark for BB-DO involving epistasis among parameters -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art VAE-based EDA methods, as well as leading approaches such as P3 and DSMGA-II.

Abstract: We introduce kernel density machines (KDM), a novel density ratio estimator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting. KDM applies to general probability measures on countably generated measurable spaces without restrictive assumptions on continuity, or the existence of a Lebesgue density. For computational efficiency, we incorporate a low-rank approximation with precisely controlled error that grants scalability to large-sample settings. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and finite-sample error bounds, establishing a strong foundation for practical use. Empirical results based on simulated and real data demonstrate the efficacy and precision of KDM.

Abstract: Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks -- extreme rainfall in a large area, huge variations of many stock prices, widespread breakdowns in transportation systems -- requires estimates of the probabilities that such risks will materialize in the future. This paper develops a new method, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN), which provides simulated values of future $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events and which hence can be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main hypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto scale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the distributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the $L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets large. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling of the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of the angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to Aitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a Wasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new values. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives simulated values on the original data scale. The method shows good performance compared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of capturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data, as well as in generating accurate new extremes of the data distribution. The comparison is performed on simulated multivariate extremes from a logistic model in dimensions up to 50 and on a 30-dimensional financial data set.

Abstract: This study addresses the critical gap in Arabic natural language processing by developing an effective Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) system that enables users to find words based on their descriptions or meanings. We present a novel transformer-based approach with a semi-encoder neural network architecture featuring geometrically decreasing layers that achieves state-of-the-art results for Arabic RD tasks. Our methodology incorporates a comprehensive dataset construction process and establishes formal quality standards for Arabic lexicographic definitions. Experiments with various pre-trained models demonstrate that Arabic-specific models significantly outperform general multilingual embeddings, with ARBERTv2 achieving the best ranking score (0.0644). Additionally, we provide a formal abstraction of the reverse dictionary task that enhances theoretical understanding and develop a modular, extensible Python library (RDTL) with configurable training pipelines. Our analysis of dataset quality reveals important insights for improving Arabic definition construction, leading to eight specific standards for building high-quality reverse dictionary resources. This work contributes significantly to Arabic computational linguistics and provides valuable tools for language learning, academic writing, and professional communication in Arabic.

<title>ClassWise-CRF: Category-Specific Fusion for Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery</title>

Abstract: We propose a result-level category-specific fusion architecture called ClassWise-CRF. This architecture employs a two-stage process: first, it selects expert networks that perform well in specific categories from a pool of candidate networks using a greedy algorithm; second, it integrates the segmentation predictions of these selected networks by adaptively weighting their contributions based on their segmentation performance in each category. Inspired by Conditional Random Field (CRF), the ClassWise-CRF architecture treats the segmentation predictions from multiple networks as confidence vector fields. It leverages segmentation metrics (such as Intersection over Union) from the validation set as priors and employs an exponential weighting strategy to fuse the category-specific confidence scores predicted by each network. This fusion method dynamically adjusts the weights of each network for different categories, achieving category-specific optimization. Building on this, the architecture further optimizes the fused results using unary and pairwise potentials in CRF to ensure spatial consistency and boundary accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of ClassWise-CRF, we conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, LoveDA and Vaihingen, using eight classic and advanced semantic segmentation networks. The results show that the ClassWise-CRF architecture significantly improves segmentation performance: on the LoveDA dataset, the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metric increased by 1.00% on the validation set and by 0.68% on the test set; on the Vaihingen dataset, the mIoU improved by 0.87% on the validation set and by 0.91% on the test set. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the ClassWise-CRF architecture in semantic segmentation of remote sensing images.

Abstract: With the recent development of new geometric and angular-radial frameworks for multivariate extremes, reliably simulating from angular variables in moderate-to-high dimensions is of increasing importance. Empirical approaches have the benefit of simplicity, and work reasonably well in low dimensions, but as the number of variables increases, they can lack the required flexibility and scalability. Classical parametric models for angular variables, such as the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, provide an alternative. Exploiting mixtures of vMF distributions increases their flexibility, but there are cases where even this is not sufficient to capture the intricate features that can arise in data. Owing to their flexibility, generative deep learning methods are able to capture complex data structures; they therefore have the potential to be useful in the simulation of angular variables. In this paper, we explore a range of deep learning approaches for this task, including generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows and flow matching. We assess their performance via a range of metrics and make comparisons to the more classical approach of using a mixture of vMF distributions. The methods are also applied to a metocean data set, demonstrating their applicability to real-world, complex data structures.

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GP) are a versatile tool in machine learning and computational science. We here consider the case of multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP) and present low-rank approaches for efficiently computing the posterior mean of a MOGP. Starting from low-rank spatio-temporal data we consider a structured covariance function, assuming separability across space and time. This separability, in turn, gives a decomposition of the covariance matrix into a Kronecker product of individual covariance matrices. Incorporating the typical noise term to the model then requires the solution of a large-scale Stein equation for computing the posterior mean. For this, we propose efficient low-rank methods based on a combination of a LRPCG method with the Sylvester equation solver KPIK adjusted for solving Stein equations. We test the developed method on real world street network graphs by using graph filters as covariance matrices. Moreover, we propose a degree-weighted average covariance matrix, which can be employed under specific assumptions to achieve more efficient convergence.

Abstract: In recent studies, numerous previous works emphasize the importance of semantic segmentation of LiDAR data as a critical component to the development of driver-assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. However, many state-of-the-art methods are tested on outdated, lower-resolution LiDAR sensors and struggle with real-time constraints. This study introduces a novel semantic segmentation framework tailored for modern high-resolution LiDAR sensors that addresses both accuracy and real-time processing demands. We propose a novel LiDAR dataset collected by a cutting-edge automotive 128 layer LiDAR in urban traffic scenes. Furthermore, we propose a semantic segmentation method utilizing surface normals as strong input features. Our approach is bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical automotive applications. Additionaly, we provide a Robot Operating System (ROS2) implementation that we operate on our research vehicle. Our dataset and code are publicly available: https://github.com/kav-institute/SemanticLiDAR.

Abstract: Fairness auditing of AI systems can identify and quantify biases. However, traditional auditing using real-world data raises security and privacy concerns. It exposes auditors to security risks as they become custodians of sensitive information and targets for cyberattacks. Privacy risks arise even without direct breaches, as data analyses can inadvertently expose confidential information. To address these, we propose a framework that leverages differentially private synthetic data to audit the fairness of AI systems. By applying privacy-preserving mechanisms, it generates synthetic data that mirrors the statistical properties of the original dataset while ensuring privacy. This method balances the goal of rigorous fairness auditing and the need for strong privacy protections. Through experiments on real datasets like Adult, COMPAS, and Diabetes, we compare fairness metrics of synthetic and real data. By analyzing the alignment and discrepancies between these metrics, we assess the capacity of synthetic data to preserve the fairness properties of real data. Our results demonstrate the framework's ability to enable meaningful fairness evaluations while safeguarding sensitive information, proving its applicability across critical and sensitive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve accuracy by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, recent research has revealed RAG's susceptibility to poisoning attacks, where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database, leading to attacker-desired responses. Existing defenses, which predominantly focus on inference-time mitigation, have proven insufficient against sophisticated attacks. In this paper, we introduce RAGForensics, the first traceback system for RAG, designed to identify poisoned texts within the knowledge database that are responsible for the attacks. RAGForensics operates iteratively, first retrieving a subset of texts from the database and then utilizing a specially crafted prompt to guide an LLM in detecting potential poisoning texts. Empirical evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of RAGForensics against state-of-the-art poisoning attacks. This work pioneers the traceback of poisoned texts in RAG systems, providing a practical and promising defense mechanism to enhance their security.

Abstract: Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any harmful output they could possibly produce. In response to this, LLM Jailbreaking is a significant threat to such protections, and many previous approaches have already demonstrated its effectiveness across diverse domains. Existing jailbreak proposals mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and design a targeted jailbreak attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits these unique patterns to break the security constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our attack.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where an attacker manipulates a small portion of the training data to implant hidden backdoors into the model. The compromised model behaves normally on clean samples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target class, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently, several empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor attacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In contrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise by adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor attacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses implicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary. However, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification performance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified backdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a sample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training sets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the predictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust prediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become inapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To conquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification method, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve certification performance. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/Cert-SSB.

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a distribution over a finite alphabet from an i.i.d. sample, with accuracy measured in relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler divergence). While optimal expected risk bounds are known, high-probability guarantees remain less well-understood. First, we analyze the classical Laplace (add-$1$) estimator, obtaining matching upper and lower bounds on its performance and showing its optimality among confidence-independent estimators. We then characterize the minimax-optimal high-probability risk achievable by any estimator, which is attained via a simple confidence-dependent smoothing technique. Interestingly, the optimal non-asymptotic risk contains an additional logarithmic factor over the ideal asymptotic risk. Next, motivated by scenarios where the alphabet exceeds the sample size, we investigate methods that adapt to the sparsity of the distribution at hand. We introduce an estimator using data-dependent smoothing, for which we establish a high-probability risk bound depending on two effective sparsity parameters. As part of the analysis, we also derive a sharp high-probability upper bound on the missing mass.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face challenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of annotated data. This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps, generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous regions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net model (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa identification.

<title>Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model</title>

Abstract: The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on XX-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance.

Abstract: The growing luminosity frontier at the Large Hadron Collider is challenging the reconstruction and analysis of particle collision events. Increased particle multiplicities are straining latency and storage requirements at the data acquisition stage, while new complications are emerging, including higher background levels and more frequent particle vertex misassociations. This in turn necessitates the development of more holistic and scalable reconstruction methods that take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture featuring unique representations for diverse particle collision relationships and integrated graph pruning layers for scalability. Trained with a multi-task paradigm in an environment mimicking the LHCb experiment, this HGNN significantly improves beauty hadron reconstruction performance. Notably, it concurrently performs particle vertex association and graph pruning within a single framework. We quantify reconstruction and pruning performance, demonstrate enhanced inference time scaling with event complexity, and mitigate potential performance loss using a weighted message passing scheme.

Abstract: The majority of biomedical studies use limited datasets that may not generalize over large heterogeneous datasets that have been collected over several decades. The current paper develops and validates several multimodal models that can predict 1-year mortality based on a massive clinical dataset. Our focus on predicting 1-year mortality can provide a sense of urgency to the patients. Using the largest dataset of its kind, the paper considers the development and validation of multimodal models based on 25,137,015 videos associated with 699,822 echocardiography studies from 316,125 patients, and 2,922,990 8-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) traces from 631,353 patients. Our models allow us to assess the contribution of individual factors and modalities to the overall risk. Our approach allows us to develop extremely low-parameter models that use optimized feature selection based on feature importance. Based on available clinical information, we construct a family of models that are made available in the DISIML package. Overall, performance ranges from an AUC of 0.72 with just ten parameters to an AUC of 0.89 with under 105k for the full multimodal model. The proposed approach represents a modular neural network framework that can provide insights into global risk trends and guide therapies for reducing mortality risk.

Abstract: The variability of wind power supply can present substantial challenges to incorporating wind power into a grid system. Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions. The dataset is released at https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/datasets.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019) resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions, and highlights its potential to identify opportunities for emission reduction.

Abstract: Video games have served as useful benchmarks for the decision-making community, but going beyond Atari games towards modern games has been prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of the research community. Prior work in modern video games typically relied on game-specific integration to obtain game features and enable online training, or on existing large datasets. An alternative approach is to train agents using imitation learning to play video games purely from images. However, this setting poses a fundamental question: which visual encoders obtain representations that retain information critical for decision making? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic study of imitation learning with publicly available pre-trained visual encoders compared to the typical task-specific end-to-end training approach in Minecraft, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Minecraft Dungeons. Our results show that end-to-end training can be effective with comparably low-resolution images and only minutes of demonstrations, but significant improvements can be gained by utilising pre-trained encoders such as DINOv2 depending on the game. In addition to enabling effective decision making, we show that pre-trained encoders can make decision-making research in video games more accessible by significantly reducing the cost of training.

Abstract: The excessive computational requirements of modern artificial neural networks (ANNs) are posing limitations on the machines that can run them. Sparsification of ANNs is often motivated by time, memory and energy savings only during model inference, yielding no benefits during training. A growing body of work is now focusing on providing the benefits of model sparsification also during training. While these methods greatly improve the training efficiency, the training algorithms yielding the most accurate models still materialize the dense weights, or compute dense gradients during training. We propose an efficient, always-sparse training algorithm with excellent scaling to larger and sparser models, supported by its linear time complexity with respect to the model width during training and inference. Moreover, our guided stochastic exploration algorithm improves over the accuracy of previous sparse training methods. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and ViT models, and compare it against a range of sparsification methods.

Abstract: We present algorithms that substantially accelerate partition-based cross-validation for machine learning models that require matrix products $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Our algorithms have applications in model selection for, for example, principal component analysis (PCA), principal component regression (PCR), ridge regression (RR), ordinary least squares (OLS), and partial least squares (PLS). Our algorithms support all combinations of column-wise centering and scaling of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$, and we demonstrate in our accompanying implementation that this adds only a manageable, practical constant over efficient variants without preprocessing. We prove the correctness of our algorithms under a fold-based partitioning scheme and show that the running time is independent of the number of folds; that is, they have the same time complexity as that of computing $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ and space complexity equivalent to storing $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{Y}$, $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$, and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. Importantly, unlike alternatives found in the literature, we avoid data leakage due to preprocessing. We achieve these results by eliminating redundant computations in the overlap between training partitions. Concretely, we show how to manipulate $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$ using only samples from the validation partition to obtain the preprocessed training partition-wise $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{X}^\mathbf{T}\mathbf{Y}$. To our knowledge, we are the first to derive correct and efficient cross-validation algorithms for any of the $16$ combinations of column-wise centering and scaling, for which we also prove only $12$ give distinct matrix products.

Abstract: Our understanding of the generalization capabilities of neural networks (NNs) is still incomplete. Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient descent (GD) but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradient-free methods nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks. This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs.
  Findings. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD, we examine untrained, random-weight networks. Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent "simplicity bias". This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks.
  Implications. We provide a fresh explanation for the success of deep learning independent from gradient-based training. It points at promising avenues for controlling the solutions implemented by trained models.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of I) investigating the impact of multi-granular interactions across recent snapshots, and II) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, particularly events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring (HisRES). Concretely, HisRES comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, HisRES incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of HisRES and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.

Abstract: Skills are effective temporal abstractions established for sequential decision making, which enable efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks and facilitate multi-task learning through their transferability. Despite extensive research, research gaps remain in multi-agent scenarios, particularly for automatically extracting subgroup coordination patterns in a multi-agent task. In this case, we propose two novel auto-encoder schemes: VO-MASD-3D and VO-MASD-Hier, to simultaneously capture subgroup- and temporal-level abstractions and form multi-agent skills, which firstly solves the aforementioned challenge. An essential algorithm component of these schemes is a dynamic grouping function that can automatically detect latent subgroups based on agent interactions in a task. Further, our method can be applied to offline multi-task data, and the discovered subgroup skills can be transferred across relevant tasks without retraining. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft tasks indicate that our approach significantly outperforms existing hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods. Moreover, skills discovered using our method can effectively reduce the learning difficulty in MARL scenarios with delayed and sparse reward signals. The codebase is available at https://github.com/LucasCJYSDL/VOMASD.

<title>FADE: Towards Fairness-aware Generation for Domain Generalization via Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Fairness-aware domain generalization (FairDG) has emerged as a critical challenge for deploying trustworthy AI systems, particularly in scenarios involving distribution shifts. Traditional methods for addressing fairness have failed in domain generalization due to their lack of consideration for distribution shifts. Although disentanglement has been used to tackle FairDG, it is limited by its strong assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Fairness-aware Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models (FADE) as a novel approach to effectively address the FairDG issue. Specifically, we first pre-train a score-based diffusion model (SDM) and two classifiers to equip the model with strong generalization capabilities across different domains. Then, we guide the SDM using these pre-trained classifiers to effectively eliminate sensitive information from the generated data. Finally, the generated fair data is used to train downstream classifiers, ensuring robust performance under new data distributions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FADE not only enhances fairness but also improves accuracy in the presence of distribution shifts. Additionally, FADE outperforms existing methods in achieving the best accuracy-fairness trade-offs.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in a Federated Learning (FL) system, i.e., a satisfactory performance for all of the participating diverse clients, is an important and challenging problem. There are multiple fair FL algorithms in the literature, which have been relatively successful in providing fairness. However, these algorithms mostly emphasize on the loss functions of worst-off clients to improve their performance, which often results in the suppression of well-performing ones. As a consequence, they usually sacrifice the system's overall average performance for achieving fairness. Motivated by this and inspired by two well-known risk modeling methods in Finance, Mean-Variance and Mean-Semi-Variance, we propose and study two new fair FL algorithms, Variance Reduction (VRed) and Semi-Variance Reduction (SemiVRed). VRed encourages equality between clients' loss functions by penalizing their variance. In contrast, SemiVRed penalizes the discrepancy of only the worst-off clients' loss functions from the average loss. Through extensive experiments on multiple vision and language datasets, we show that, SemiVRed achieves SoTA performance in scenarios with heterogeneous data distributions and improves both fairness and system overall average performance.

Abstract: We present a novel method, Contextual goal-Oriented Data Augmentation (CODA), which uses commonly available unlabeled trajectories and context-goal pairs to solve Contextual Goal-Oriented (CGO) problems. By carefully constructing an action-augmented MDP that is equivalent to the original MDP, CODA creates a fully labeled transition dataset under training contexts without additional approximation error. We conduct a novel theoretical analysis to demonstrate CODA's capability to solve CGO problems in the offline data setup. Empirical results also showcase the effectiveness of CODA, which outperforms other baseline methods across various context-goal relationships of CGO problem. This approach offers a promising direction to solving CGO problems using offline datasets.

Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are first trained on massive datasets before being adapted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is only fine-tuned to maximize predictive accuracy. We then provide a novel set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are root-n-consistent. Based on this theory, we develop new fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage decomposition. This is a statistical estimation problem from econometrics where the goal is to decompose the gender wage gap into components that can and cannot be explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on coarse summaries of career history that may omit factors that are important for explaining the gap. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model to decompose the gender wage gap, which captures a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the wage gap.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that Transformers trained from scratch can successfully solve various arithmetic and algorithmic tasks, such as adding numbers and computing parity. While these Transformers generalize well on unseen inputs of the same length, they struggle with length generalization, i.e., handling inputs of unseen lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that looped Transformers with an adaptive number of steps significantly improve length generalization. We focus on tasks with a known iterative solution, involving multiple iterations of a RASP-L operation - a length-generalizable operation that can be expressed by a finite-sized Transformer. We train looped Transformers using our proposed learning algorithm and observe that they learn highly length-generalizable solutions for various tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events necessitates both high-resolution products (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical records (to capture rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide kilometer-scale precipitation fields, but with limited historical records and geographical coverage. Conversely, global gauge and blended products span decades, yet their coarse 30-50 km grids obscure local extremes. This work introduces Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a generative downscaling framework that integrates diffusion modeling with a distribution-matching (Wasserstein) regularizer, suppressing bias throughout the entire generative denoising process. Conditioned on 55 km CPC gauge-based precipitation and the 31 km ERA5 reanalysis, WassDiff generates 1 km precipitation estimates that remain well-calibrated to targets across the full intensity range, including the extremes. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff outperforms existing state-of-the-art downscaling methods, delivering lower reconstruction error and reduced bias. Case studies further demonstrate its ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities from extreme weather phenomena, such as tropical storms and cold fronts. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning.

Abstract: A major challenge for transformers is generalizing to sequences longer than those observed during training. While previous works have empirically shown that transformers can either succeed or fail at length generalization depending on the task, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this work, we introduce a rigorous theoretical framework to analyze length generalization in causal transformers with learnable absolute positional encodings. In particular, we characterize those functions that are identifiable in the limit from sufficiently long inputs with absolute positional encodings under an idealized inference scheme using a norm-based regularizer. This enables us to prove the possibility of length generalization for a rich family of problems. We experimentally validate the theory as a predictor of success and failure of length generalization across a range of algorithmic and formal language tasks. Our theory not only explains a broad set of empirical observations but also opens the way to provably predicting length generalization capabilities in transformers.

Abstract: Classical assumptions like strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness often fail to capture the nature of deep learning optimization problems, which are typically non-convex and non-smooth, making traditional analyses less applicable. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning by extending the conventional notions of strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. By leveraging these concepts, we prove that, under the established constraints, the empirical risk minimization problem is equivalent to optimizing the local gradient norm and structural error, which together constitute the upper and lower bounds of the empirical risk. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm can effectively minimize the local gradient norm. Additionally, techniques like skip connections, over-parameterization, and random parameter initialization are shown to help control the structural error. Ultimately, we validate the core conclusions of this paper through extensive experiments. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced adaptive random Fourier features (ARFF) training algorithm for shallow neural networks, building upon the work introduced in "Adaptive Random Fourier Features with Metropolis Sampling", Kammonen et al., \emph{Foundations of Data Science}, 2(3):309--332, 2020. This improved method uses a particle filter-type resampling technique to stabilize the training process and reduce the sensitivity to parameter choices. The Metropolis test can also be omitted when resampling is used, reducing the number of hyperparameters by one and reducing the computational cost per iteration compared to the ARFF method. We present comprehensive numerical experiments demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in function regression tasks as a stand-alone method and as a pretraining step before gradient-based optimization, using the Adam optimizer. Furthermore, we apply the proposed algorithm to a simple image regression problem, illustrating its utility in sampling frequencies for the random Fourier features (RFF) layer of coordinate-based multilayer perceptrons. In this context, we use the proposed algorithm to sample the parameters of the RFF layer in an automated manner.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination, which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models (STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction. GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari 100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and quantitative analyses on the DeepMind Control Suite, showcasing the effectiveness of Transformer-based World Models in this new domain. Our results highlight the versatility and efficacy of the MaskGIT dynamics prior, paving the way for more accurate world models and effective RL policies.

Abstract: Liver cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and accurate Computed Tomography (CT)-based tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Manual delineation is time-intensive, prone to variability, and highlights the need for reliable automation. While deep learning has shown promise for automated liver segmentation, precise liver tumor segmentation remains challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumors, imprecise tumor margins, and limited labeled data. We present SmoothSegNet, a novel deep learning framework that addresses these challenges with the three key designs: (1) A novel knowledge-informed label smoothing technique that distills knowledge from clinical data to generate smooth labels, which are used to regularize model training, reducing the overfitting risk and enhancing model performance; (2) A global and local segmentation framework that breaks down the main task into two simpler sub-tasks, allowing optimized preprocessing and training for each; and (3) Pre- and post-processing pipelines customized to the challenges of each subtask aimed to enhance tumor visibility and refines tumor boundaries. We apply the proposed model on a challenging HCC-TACE-Seg dataset and show that SmoothSegNet outperformed various benchmarks in segmentation performance, particularly at smaller tumors (<10cm). Our ablation studies show that the three design components complementarily contribute to the model improved performance. Code for the proposed method are available at https://github.com/lingchm/medassist-liver-cancer.

Abstract: Substantial efforts have been devoted to alleviating the impact of the long-tailed class distribution in federated learning. In this work, we observe an interesting phenomenon that certain weak classes consistently exist even for class-balanced learning. These weak classes, different from the minority classes in the previous works, are inherent to data and remain fairly consistent for various network structures, learning paradigms, and data partitioning methods. The inherent inter-class accuracy discrepancy can reach over 36.9% for federated learning on the FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, even when the class distribution is balanced both globally and locally. In this study, we empirically analyze the potential reason for this phenomenon. Furthermore, a partial knowledge distillation (PKD) method is proposed to improve the model's classification accuracy for weak classes. In this approach, knowledge transfer is initiated upon the occurrence of specific misclassifications within certain weak classes. Experimental results show that the accuracy of weak classes can be improved by 10.7%, reducing the inherent inter-class discrepancy effectively.

Abstract: In healthcare, the integration of multimodal data is pivotal for developing comprehensive diagnostic and predictive models. However, managing missing data remains a significant challenge in real-world applications. We introduce MARIA (Multimodal Attention Resilient to Incomplete datA), a novel transformer-based deep learning model designed to address these challenges through an intermediate fusion strategy. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on imputation, MARIA utilizes a masked self-attention mechanism, which processes only the available data without generating synthetic values. This approach enables it to effectively handle incomplete datasets, enhancing robustness and minimizing biases introduced by imputation methods. We evaluated MARIA against 10 state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models across 8 diagnostic and prognostic tasks. The results demonstrate that MARIA outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and resilience to varying levels of data incompleteness, underscoring its potential for critical healthcare applications.

Abstract: Disease progression models are widely used to inform the diagnosis and treatment of many progressive diseases. However, a significant limitation of existing models is that they do not account for health disparities that can bias the observed data. To address this, we develop an interpretable Bayesian disease progression model that captures three key health disparities: certain patient populations may (1) start receiving care only when their disease is more severe, (2) experience faster disease progression even while receiving care, or (3) receive follow-up care less frequently conditional on disease severity. We show theoretically and empirically that failing to account for any of these disparities can result in biased estimates of severity (e.g., underestimating severity for disadvantaged groups). On a dataset of heart failure patients, we show that our model can identify groups that face each type of health disparity, and that accounting for these disparities while inferring disease severity meaningfully shifts which patients are considered high-risk.

Abstract: Modern machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning based techniques, typically involve careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. Despite the surge of intense interest in practical techniques like Bayesian optimization and random search based approaches to automating this laborious and compute intensive task, the fundamental learning theoretic complexity of tuning hyperparameters for deep neural networks is poorly understood. Inspired by this glaring gap, we initiate the formal study of hyperparameter tuning complexity in deep learning through a recently introduced data driven setting. We assume that we have a series of deep learning tasks, and we have to tune hyperparameters to do well on average over the distribution of tasks. A major difficulty is that the utility function as a function of the hyperparameter is very volatile and furthermore, it is given implicitly by an optimization problem over the model parameters. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new technique to characterize the discontinuities and oscillations of the utility function on any fixed problem instance as we vary the hyperparameter; our analysis relies on subtle concepts including tools from differential/algebraic geometry and constrained optimization. This can be used to show that the learning theoretic complexity of the corresponding family of utility functions is bounded. We instantiate our results and provide sample complexity bounds for concrete applications tuning a hyperparameter that interpolates neural activation functions and setting the kernel parameter in graph neural networks.

Abstract: We introduce BCAT, a PDE foundation model designed for autoregressive prediction of solutions to two dimensional fluid dynamics problems. Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 3.5x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.18% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks. With fine-tuning on a turbulence dataset, we show that the method adapts to new settings with more than 40% better accuracy over prior methods.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of automated decision-making based on neural networks will be crucial as Artificial Intelligence systems are deployed more widely in critical situations. This paper proposes a new approach for measuring confidence in the predictions of any neural network that relies on the predictions of a softmax layer. We identify that a high-accuracy trained network may have certain outputs for which there should be low confidence. In such cases, decisions should be deferred and it is more appropriate for the network to provide a \textit{not known} answer to a corresponding classification task. Our approach clusters the vectors in the softmax layer to measure distances between cluster centroids and network outputs. We show that a cluster with centroid calculated simply as the mean softmax output for all correct predictions can serve as a suitable proxy in the evaluation of confidence. Defining a distance threshold for a class as the smallest distance from an incorrect prediction to the given class centroid offers a simple approach to adding \textit{not known} answers to any network classification falling outside of the threshold. We evaluate the approach on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using a Convolutional Neural Network and a Vision Transformer, respectively. The results show that our approach is consistent across datasets and network models, and indicate that the proposed distance metric can offer an efficient way of determining when automated predictions are acceptable and when they should be deferred to human operators.

Abstract: Consistency distillation is a prevalent way for accelerating diffusion models adopted in consistency (trajectory) models, in which a student model is trained to traverse backward on the probability flow (PF) ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory determined by the teacher model. Preconditioning is a vital technique for stabilizing consistency distillation, by linear combining the input data and the network output with pre-defined coefficients as the consistency function. It imposes the boundary condition of consistency functions without restricting the form and expressiveness of the neural network. However, previous preconditionings are hand-crafted and may be suboptimal choices. In this work, we offer the first theoretical insights into the preconditioning in consistency distillation, by elucidating its design criteria and the connection to the teacher ODE trajectory. Based on these analyses, we further propose a principled way dubbed \textit{Analytic-Precond} to analytically optimize the preconditioning according to the consistency gap (defined as the gap between the teacher denoiser and the optimal student denoiser) on a generalized teacher ODE. We demonstrate that Analytic-Precond can facilitate the learning of trajectory jumpers, enhance the alignment of the student trajectory with the teacher's, and achieve $2\times$ to $3\times$ training acceleration of consistency trajectory models in multi-step generation across various datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of producing high-quality contents such as images, videos, and audio, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize digital content creation. However, these capabilities come at the cost of their significant computational resources and lengthy generation time, underscoring the critical need to develop efficient techniques for practical deployment. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of research on efficient diffusion models. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient diffusion model topics from algorithm-level, system-level, and framework perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we organize the papers featured in this survey at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-Diffusion-Model-Survey. We hope our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of efficient diffusion model research and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field.

Abstract: Lab tests are fundamental for diagnosing diseases and monitoring patient conditions. However, frequent testing can be burdensome for patients, and test results may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges, we propose LabTOP, a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by leveraging a language modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional methods that estimate only a subset of lab tests or classify discrete value ranges, LabTOP performs continuous numerical predictions for a diverse range of lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three publicly available EHR datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods, including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of our design choices. We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable framework for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical decision support and early detection of critical conditions.

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) learning offers a powerful framework for generating new knowledge and making inferences. Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well. An implementation of the SpTransX framework is publicly available as a Python package in https://github.com/HipGraph/SpTransX.

Abstract: Background: With the increasing availability of healthcare data, predictive modeling finds many applications in the biomedical domain, such as the evaluation of the level of risk for various conditions, which in turn can guide clinical decision making. However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.

Abstract: With the digitalization of power grids, physical equations become insufficient to describe the network's behavior, and realistic but time-consuming simulators must be used. Numerical experiments, such as safety validation, that involve simulating a large number of scenarios become computationally intractable. A popular solution to reduce the computational burden is to learn a surrogate model of the simulator with Machine Learning (ML) and then conduct the experiment directly on the fast-to-evaluate surrogate model. Among the various ML possibilities for building surrogate models, Gaussian processes (GPs) emerged as a popular solution due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and interpretability. Their probabilistic nature enables them to provide both predictions and uncertainty quantification (UQ). This paper starts with a discussion on the interest of using GPs to approximate power grid simulators and fasten numerical experiments. Such simulators, however, often violate the GP's underlying Gaussian assumption, leading to poor approximations. To address this limitation, an approach that consists in adding an adaptive residual uncertainty term to the UQ is proposed. It enables the GP to remain accurate and reliable despite the simulator's non-Gaussian behaviors. This approach is successfully applied to the certification of the proper functioning of a congestion management controller, with over 98% of simulations avoided.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved.
  In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.

Abstract: Urban traffic optimization is critical for improving transportation efficiency and alleviating congestion, particularly in large-scale dynamic networks. Traditional methods, such as Dijkstra's and Floyd's algorithms, provide effective solutions in static settings, but they struggle with the spatial-temporal complexity of real-world traffic flows. In this work, we propose TrafficKAN-GCN, a hybrid deep learning framework combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), designed to enhance urban traffic flow optimization. By integrating KAN's adaptive nonlinear function approximation with GCN's spatial graph learning capabilities, TrafficKAN-GCN captures both complex traffic patterns and topological dependencies. We evaluate the proposed framework using real-world traffic data from the Baltimore Metropolitan area. Compared with baseline models such as MLP-GCN, standard GCN, and Transformer-based approaches, TrafficKAN-GCN achieves competitive prediction accuracy while demonstrating improved robustness in handling noisy and irregular traffic data. Our experiments further highlight the framework's ability to redistribute traffic flow, mitigate congestion, and adapt to disruptive events, such as the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. This study contributes to the growing body of work on hybrid graph learning for intelligent transportation systems, highlighting the potential of combining KAN and GCN for real-time traffic optimization. Future work will focus on reducing computational overhead and integrating Transformer-based temporal modeling for enhanced long-term traffic prediction. The proposed TrafficKAN-GCN framework offers a promising direction for data-driven urban mobility management, balancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) develop patch embedding and convolution backbone within vector space, especially Euclidean ones, at the very founding. When expanding VLMs to a galaxy scale for understanding astronomical phenomena, the integration of spherical space for planetary orbits and hyperbolic spaces for black holes raises two formidable challenges. a) The current pre-training model is confined to Euclidean space rather than a comprehensive geometric embedding. b) The predominant architecture lacks suitable backbones for anisotropic physical geometries. In this paper, we introduced Galaxy-Walker, a geometry-aware VLM, for the universe-level vision understanding tasks. We proposed the geometry prompt that generates geometry tokens by random walks across diverse spaces on a multi-scale physical graph, along with a geometry adapter that compresses and reshapes the space anisotropy in a mixture-of-experts manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with Galaxy-Walker achieving state-of-the-art performance in both galaxy property estimation ($R^2$ scores up to $0.91$) and morphology classification tasks (up to $+0.17$ F1 improvement in challenging features), significantly outperforming both domain-specific models and general-purpose VLMs.

Abstract: Regarding the representation theorem of Kolmogorov and Arnold (KA) as an algorithm for representing or {\guillemotleft}expressing{\guillemotright} functions, we test its robustness by analyzing its ability to withstand adversarial attacks. We find KA to be robust to countable collections of continuous adversaries, but unearth a question about the equi-continuity of the outer functions that, so far, obstructs taking limits and defeating continuous groups of adversaries. This question on the regularity of the outer functions is relevant to the debate over the applicability of KA to the general theory of NNs.

Abstract: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has driven many recent breakthroughs in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.

Abstract: We investigate a failure mode that arises during the training of reasoning models, where the diversity of generations begins to collapse, leading to suboptimal test-time scaling. Notably, the Pass@1 rate reliably improves during supervised finetuning (SFT), but Pass@k rapidly deteriorates. Surprisingly, a simple intervention of interpolating the weights of the latest SFT checkpoint with an early checkpoint, otherwise known as WiSE-FT, almost completely recovers Pass@k while also improving Pass@1. The WiSE-FT variant achieves better test-time scaling (Best@k, majority vote) and achieves superior results with less data when tuned further by reinforcement learning. Finally, we find that WiSE-FT provides complementary performance gains that cannot be achieved only through diversity-inducing decoding strategies, like temperature scaling. We formalize a bias-variance tradeoff of Pass@k with respect to the expectation and variance of Pass@1 over the test distribution. We find that WiSE-FT can reduce bias and variance simultaneously, while temperature scaling inherently trades off between bias and variance.

Abstract: The evolution of tokens through a deep transformer models can be modeled as an interacting particle system that has been shown to exhibit an asymptotic clustering behavior akin to the synchronization phenomenon in Kuramoto models. In this work, we investigate the long-time clustering of mean-field transformer models. More precisely, we establish exponential rates of contraction to a Dirac point mass for any suitably regular initialization under some assumptions on the parameters of transformer models, any suitably regular mean-field initialization synchronizes exponentially fast with some quantitative rates.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized model training framework that aims to merge isolated data islands while maintaining data privacy. However, recent studies have revealed that Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based attacks can be employed in FL to learn the distribution of private datasets and reconstruct recognizable images. In this paper, we exploit defenses against GAN-based attacks in FL and propose a framework, Anti-GAN, to prevent attackers from learning the real distribution of the victim's data. The core idea of Anti-GAN is to manipulate the visual features of private training images to make them indistinguishable to human eyes even restored by attackers. Specifically, Anti-GAN projects the private dataset onto a GAN's generator and combines the generated fake images with the actual images to create the training dataset, which is then used for federated model training. The experimental results demonstrate that Anti-GAN is effective in preventing attackers from learning the distribution of private images while causing minimal harm to the accuracy of the federated model.

Abstract: We study the oracle complexity of producing $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points of Lipschitz functions, in the sense proposed by Zhang et al. [2020]. While there exist dimension-free randomized algorithms for producing such points within $\widetilde{O}(1/\delta\epsilon^3)$ first-order oracle calls, we show that no dimension-free rate can be achieved by a deterministic algorithm. On the other hand, we point out that this rate can be derandomized for smooth functions with merely a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness parameter. Moreover, we establish several lower bounds for this task which hold for any randomized algorithm, with or without convexity. Finally, we show how the convergence rate of finding $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points can be improved in case the function is convex, a setting which we motivate by proving that in general no finite time algorithm can produce points with small subgradients even for convex functions.

<title>Semantic Positive Pairs for Enhancing Visual Representation Learning of Instance Discrimination Methods</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning algorithms (SSL) based on instance discrimination have shown promising results, performing competitively or even outperforming supervised learning counterparts in some downstream tasks. Such approaches employ data augmentation to create two views of the same instance (i.e., positive pairs) and encourage the model to learn good representations by attracting these views closer in the embedding space without collapsing to the trivial solution. However, data augmentation is limited in representing positive pairs, and the repulsion process between the instances during contrastive learning may discard important features for instances that have similar categories. To address this issue, we propose an approach to identify those images with similar semantic content and treat them as positive instances, thereby reducing the chance of discarding important features during representation learning and increasing the richness of the latent representation. Our approach is generic and could work with any self-supervised instance discrimination frameworks such as MoCo and SimSiam. To evaluate our method, we run experiments on three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, STL-10 and CIFAR-10 with different instance discrimination SSL approaches. The experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all three datasets; for instance, we improve upon the vanilla MoCo-v2 by 4.1% on ImageNet under a linear evaluation protocol over 800 epochs. We also report results on semi-supervised learning, transfer learning on downstream tasks, and object detection.

Abstract: In recent years, collaborative learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for machine learning (ML) and data science across distributed edge devices. As the deployment of CL jobs increases, they inevitably contend for limited resources. However, efficient resource scheduling in this context is challenging because of the ephemeral nature and resource heterogeneity of devices, coupled with the overlapping resource requirements of diverse CL jobs. Existing resource managers often assign devices to CL jobs randomly for simplicity and scalability, but this approach compromises job efficiency.
  In this paper, we present Venn, a CL resource manager that efficiently schedules ephemeral, heterogeneous devices among multiple CL jobs to reduce the average job completion time (JCT). Venn formulates the Intersection Resource Scheduling (IRS) problem to identify complex resource contention among multiple CL jobs. It then proposes a contention-aware scheduling heuristic to minimize the average scheduling delay. Furthermore, it proposes a resource-aware device-to-job matching heuristic to optimize response collection time by mitigating stragglers. Our evaluation shows that, compared to the state-of-the-art CL resource managers, Venn improves the average JCT by up to 1.88x. The code is available at https://github.com/SymbioticLab/Venn.

Abstract: Synthesis of same-identity biometric iris images, both for existing and non-existing identities while preserving the identity across a wide range of pupil sizes, is complex due to the intricate iris muscle constriction mechanism, requiring a precise model of iris non-linear texture deformations to be embedded into the synthesis pipeline. This paper presents the first method of fully data-driven, identity-preserving, pupil size-varying synthesis of iris images. This approach is capable of synthesizing images of irises with different pupil sizes representing non-existing identities, as well as non-linearly deforming the texture of iris images of existing subjects given the segmentation mask of the target iris image. Iris recognition experiments suggest that the proposed deformation model both preserves the identity when changing the pupil size, and offers better similarity between same-identity iris samples with significant differences in pupil size, compared to state-of-the-art linear and non-linear (bio-mechanical-based) iris deformation models. Two immediate applications of the proposed approach are: (a) synthesis of, or enhancement of the existing biometric datasets for iris recognition, mimicking those acquired with iris sensors, and (b) helping forensic human experts examine iris image pairs with significant differences in pupil dilation. Images considered in this work conform to selected ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality metrics to make them applicable in biometric systems. The source codes and model weights are offered with this paper.

Abstract: Pervasive across diverse domains, stochastic systems exhibit fluctuations in processes ranging from molecular dynamics to climate phenomena. The Langevin equation has served as a common mathematical model for studying such systems, enabling predictions of their temporal evolution and analyses of thermodynamic quantities, including absorbed heat, work done on the system, and entropy production. However, inferring the Langevin equation from observed trajectories is a challenging problem, and assessing the uncertainty associated with the inferred equation has yet to be accomplished. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that employs Bayesian neural networks for inferring Langevin equations in both overdamped and underdamped regimes. Our framework first provides the drift force and diffusion matrix separately and then combines them to construct the Langevin equation. By providing a distribution of predictions instead of a single value, our approach allows us to assess prediction uncertainties, which can help prevent potential misunderstandings and erroneous decisions about the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in inferring Langevin equations for various scenarios including a neuron model and microscopic engine, highlighting its versatility and potential impact.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, often outperforming human experts. However, deploying these gigantic models efficiently for diverse inference use cases requires carefully designed hardware platforms with ample computing, memory, and network resources. With constant innovation in LLM serving optimizations and model architecture evolving at breakneck speed, the hardware requirements to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) remain an open research question.
  To answer the question, we present an analytical tool, GenZ, to efficiently navigate the relationship between diverse LLM model architectures(Dense, GQA, MoE, Mamba), LLM serving optimizations(Chunking, Speculative decoding, quanitization), and AI platform design parameters. Our tool estimates LLM inference performance metrics for the given scenario. We have validated against real hardware platforms running various different LLM models, achieving a max geomean error of 5.82.We use GenZ to identify compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, network latency, and network bandwidth requirements across diverse LLM inference use cases. We also study diverse architectural choices in use today (inspired by LLM serving platforms from several vendors) to help inform computer architects designing next-generation AI hardware accelerators and platforms. The trends and insights derived from GenZ can guide AI engineers deploying LLMs as well as computer architects designing next-generation hardware accelerators and platforms. Ultimately, this work sheds light on the platform design considerations for unlocking the full potential of large language models across a spectrum of applications.

Abstract: The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due to privacy-related issues. Moreover, the recent rising of Large Multimodal Models (LMM) leads to a need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding CT or MR scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the data set MedPix 2.0. Starting from the well-known multimodal data set MedPix, mainly used by physicians, nurses and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure where noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a GUI aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance, and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning LMMs. To enforce this point, we also propose a CLIP-based model trained on MedPix 2.0 for scanning modality and location classification tasks. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub

Abstract: We propose a new method for feature learning and function estimation in supervised learning via regularised empirical risk minimisation. Our approach considers functions as expectations of Sobolev functions over all possible one-dimensional projections of the data. This framework is similar to kernel ridge regression, where the kernel is $\mathbb{E}_w ( k^{(B)}(w^\top x,w^\top x^\prime))$, with $k^{(B)}(a,b) := \min(|a|, |b|)\mathds{1}_{ab>0}$ the Brownian kernel, and the distribution of the projections $w$ is learnt. This can also be viewed as an infinite-width one-hidden layer neural network, optimising the first layer's weights through gradient descent and explicitly adjusting the non-linearity and weights of the second layer. We introduce a gradient-based computational method for the estimator, called Brownian Kernel Neural Network (BKerNN), using particles to approximate the expectation, where the positive homogeneity of the Brownian kernel \red{leads to improved robustness to local minima}. Using Rademacher complexity, we show that BKerNN's expected risk converges to the minimal risk with explicit high-probability rates of $O( \min((d/n)^{1/2}, n^{-1/6}))$ (up to logarithmic factors). Numerical experiments confirm our optimisation intuitions, and BKerNN outperforms kernel ridge regression, and favourably compares to a one-hidden layer neural network with ReLU activations in various settings and real data sets.

Abstract: Recovering natural language prompts for image generation models, solely based on the generated images is a difficult discrete optimization problem. In this work, we present the first head-to-head comparison of recent discrete optimization techniques for the problem of prompt inversion. We evaluate Greedy Coordinate Gradients (GCG), PEZ , Random Search, AutoDAN and BLIP2's image captioner across various evaluation metrics related to the quality of inverted prompts and the quality of the images generated by the inverted prompts. We find that focusing on the CLIP similarity between the inverted prompts and the ground truth image acts as a poor proxy for the similarity between ground truth image and the image generated by the inverted prompts. While the discrete optimizers effectively minimize their objectives, simply using responses from a well-trained captioner often leads to generated images that more closely resemble those produced by the original prompts.

Abstract: The effect of relative entropy asymmetry is analyzed in the context of empirical risk minimization (ERM) with relative entropy regularization (ERM-RER). Two regularizations are considered: $(a)$ the relative entropy of the measure to be optimized with respect to a reference measure (Type-I ERM-RER); and $(b)$ the relative entropy of the reference measure with respect to the measure to be optimized (Type-II ERM-RER). The main result is the characterization of the solution to the Type-II ERM-RER problem and its key properties. By comparing the well-understood Type-I ERM-RER with Type-II ERM-RER, the effects of entropy asymmetry are highlighted. The analysis shows that in both cases, regularization by relative entropy forces the solution's support to collapse into the support of the reference measure, introducing a strong inductive bias that negates the evidence provided by the training data. Finally, it is shown that Type-II regularization is equivalent to Type-I regularization with an appropriate transformation of the empirical risk function.

Abstract: In interactive imitation learning (IL), uncertainty quantification offers a way for the learner (i.e. robot) to contend with distribution shifts encountered during deployment by actively seeking additional feedback from an expert (i.e. human) online. Prior works use mechanisms like ensemble disagreement or Monte Carlo dropout to quantify when black-box IL policies are uncertain; however, these approaches can lead to overconfident estimates when faced with deployment-time distribution shifts. Instead, we contend that we need uncertainty quantification algorithms that can leverage the expert human feedback received during deployment time to adapt the robot's uncertainty online. To tackle this, we draw upon online conformal prediction, a distribution-free method for constructing prediction intervals online given a stream of ground-truth labels. Human labels, however, are intermittent in the interactive IL setting. Thus, from the conformal prediction side, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification algorithm called intermittent quantile tracking (IQT) that leverages a probabilistic model of intermittent labels, maintains asymptotic coverage guarantees, and empirically achieves desired coverage levels. From the interactive IL side, we develop ConformalDAgger, a new approach wherein the robot uses prediction intervals calibrated by IQT as a reliable measure of deployment-time uncertainty to actively query for more expert feedback. We compare ConformalDAgger to prior uncertainty-aware DAgger methods in scenarios where the distribution shift is (and isn't) present because of changes in the expert's policy. We find that in simulated and hardware deployments on a 7DOF robotic manipulator, ConformalDAgger detects high uncertainty when the expert shifts and increases the number of interventions compared to baselines, allowing the robot to more quickly learn the new behavior.

Abstract: The locally competitive algorithm (LCA) can solve sparse coding problems across a wide range of use cases. Recently, convolution-based LCA approaches have been shown to be highly effective for enhancing robustness for image recognition tasks in vision pipelines. To additionally maximize representational sparsity, LCA with hard-thresholding can be applied. While this combination often yields very good solutions satisfying an $\ell_0$ sparsity criterion, it comes with significant drawbacks for practical application: (i) LCA is very inefficient, typically requiring hundreds of optimization cycles for convergence; (ii) the use of hard-thresholding results in a non-convex loss function, which might lead to suboptimal minima. To address these issues, we propose the Locally Competitive Algorithm with State Warm-up via Predictive Priming (WARP-LCA), which leverages a predictor network to provide a suitable initial guess of the LCA state based on the current input. Our approach significantly improves both convergence speed and the quality of solutions, while maintaining and even enhancing the overall strengths of LCA. We demonstrate that WARP-LCA converges faster by orders of magnitude and reaches better minima compared to conventional LCA. Moreover, the learned representations are more sparse and exhibit superior properties in terms of reconstruction and denoising quality as well as robustness when applied in deep recognition pipelines. Furthermore, we apply WARP-LCA to image denoising tasks, showcasing its robustness and practical effectiveness. Our findings confirm that the naive use of LCA with hard-thresholding results in suboptimal minima, whereas initializing LCA with a predictive guess results in better outcomes. This research advances the field of biologically inspired deep learning by providing a novel approach to convolutional sparse coding.

Abstract: In this survey, we introduce Meta-Black-Box-Optimization~(MetaBBO) as an emerging avenue within the Evolutionary Computation~(EC) community, which incorporates Meta-learning approaches to assist automated algorithm design. Despite the success of MetaBBO, the current literature provides insufficient summaries of its key aspects and lacks practical guidance for implementation. To bridge this gap, we offer a comprehensive review of recent advances in MetaBBO, providing an in-depth examination of its key developments. We begin with a unified definition of the MetaBBO paradigm, followed by a systematic taxonomy of various algorithm design tasks, including algorithm selection, algorithm configuration, solution manipulation, and algorithm generation. Further, we conceptually summarize different learning methodologies behind current MetaBBO works, including reinforcement learning, supervised learning, neuroevolution, and in-context learning with Large Language Models. A comprehensive evaluation of the latest representative MetaBBO methods is then carried out, alongside an experimental analysis of their optimization performance, computational efficiency, and generalization ability. Based on the evaluation results, we meticulously identify a set of core designs that enhance the generalization and learning effectiveness of MetaBBO. Finally, we outline the vision for the field by providing insight into the latest trends and potential future directions. Relevant literature will be continuously collected and updated at https://github.com/MetaEvo/Awesome-MetaBBO.

arXiv:2411.05282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude values called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm-architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of multi-precision INT processing elements and a network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike prior techniques, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across diverse quantization settings demonstrate that MicroScopiQ achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy, while delivering up to 3x faster inference and 2x lower energy consumption compared to existing alternatives.

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a unifying representation for probabilistic models that support tractable inference. Numerous applications of PCs like controllable text generation depend on the ability to efficiently multiply two circuits. Existing multiplication algorithms require that the circuits respect the same structure, i.e. variable scopes decomposes according to the same vtree. In this work, we propose and study the task of restructuring structured(-decomposable) PCs, that is, transforming a structured PC such that it conforms to a target vtree. We propose a generic approach for this problem and show that it leads to novel polynomial-time algorithms for multiplying circuits respecting different vtrees, as well as a practical depth-reduction algorithm that preserves structured decomposibility. Our work opens up new avenues for tractable PC inference, suggesting the possibility of training with less restrictive PC structures while enabling efficient inference by changing their structures at inference time.

Abstract: The claustrum is a band-like gray matter structure located between putamen and insula whose exact functions are still actively researched. Its sheet-like structure makes it barely visible in in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans at typical resolutions and neuroimaging tools for its study, including methods for automatic segmentation, are currently very limited. In this paper, we propose a contrast- and resolution-agnostic method for claustrum segmentation at ultra-high resolution (0.35 mm isotropic); the method is based on the SynthSeg segmentation framework (Billot et al., 2023), which leverages the use of synthetic training intensity images to achieve excellent generalization. In particular, SynthSeg requires only label maps to be trained, since corresponding intensity images are synthesized on the fly with random contrast and resolution. We trained a deep learning network for automatic claustrum segmentation, using claustrum manual labels obtained from 18 ultra-high resolution MRI scans (mostly ex vivo). We demonstrated the method to work on these 18 high resolution cases (Dice score = 0.632, mean surface distance = 0.458 mm, and volumetric similarity = 0.867 using 6-fold Cross Validation (CV)), and also on in vivo T1-weighted MRI scans at typical resolutions (~1 mm isotropic). We also demonstrated that the method is robust in a test-retest setting and when applied to multimodal imaging (T2-weighted, Proton Density and quantitative T1 scans). To the best of our knowledge this is the first accurate method for automatic ultra-high resolution claustrum segmentation, which is robust against changes in contrast and resolution. The method is released at https://github.com/chiara-mauri/claustrum_segmentation and as part of the neuroimaging package Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012).

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have endowed talking head synthesis with subtle expressions and vivid head movements, but have also led to slow inference speed and insufficient control over generated results. To address these issues, we propose Ditto, a diffusion-based talking head framework that enables fine-grained controls and real-time inference. Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf motion extractor and devise a diffusion transformer to generate representations in a specific motion space. We optimize the model architecture and training strategy to address the issues in generating motion representations, including insufficient disentanglement between motion and identity, and large internal discrepancies within the representation. Besides, we employ diverse conditional signals while establishing a mapping between motion representation and facial semantics, enabling control over the generation process and correction of the results. Moreover, we jointly optimize the holistic framework to enable streaming processing, real-time inference, and low first-frame delay, offering functionalities crucial for interactive applications such as AI assistants. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Ditto generates compelling talking head videos and exhibits superiority in both controllability and real-time performance.

Abstract: Advancing planning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the key prerequisites towards unlocking their potential for performing reliably in complex and impactful domains. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate this across board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex), and we show that search-based planning can yield significant improvements in LLM game-playing strength. We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external game engine, and in internal search, the model is trained to generate in-context a linearized tree of search and a resulting final choice. Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, reliably capturing the transition and value functions in the respective environments, with minimal hallucinations. We evaluate our LLM search implementations against game-specific state-of-the-art engines, showcasing substantial improvements in strength over the base model, and reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating closer to the human search budget. Our proposed approach, combining search with domain knowledge, is not specific to board games, hinting at more general future applications.

Abstract: The biophysical interactions between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its ligands determine the specificity of the cellular immune response. However, the immense diversity of receptors and ligands has made it challenging to discover generalizable rules across the distinct binding affinity landscapes created by different ligands. Here, we present an optimization framework for discovering biophysical rules that predict whether TCRs share specificity to a ligand. Applying this framework to TCRs associated with a collection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides we systematically characterize how co-specificity depends on the type and position of amino-acid differences between receptors. We also demonstrate that the inferred rules generalize to ligands highly dissimilar to any seen during training. Our analysis reveals that matching of steric properties between substituted amino acids is more important for receptor co-specificity red than the hydrophobic properties that prominently determine evolutionary substitutability. Our analysis also quantifies the substantial importance of positions not in direct contact with the peptide for specificity. These findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the specificity of adaptive immune responses.

arXiv:2501.17690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.

Abstract: In high-energy physics, the increasing luminosity and detector granularity at the Large Hadron Collider are driving the need for more efficient data processing solutions. Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel comparison of the throughput of ML model inference between FPGAs and GPUs, focusing on the first step of the track reconstruction pipeline$\unicode{x2013}$an implementation of a multilayer perceptron. Using HLS4ML for FPGA deployment, we benchmark its performance against the GPU implementation and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for high-throughput, low-latency inference without the need for an expertise in FPGA development and while consuming significantly less power.

Abstract: The advent of large language models has ushered in a new era of agentic systems, where artificial intelligence programs exhibit remarkable autonomous decision-making capabilities across diverse domains. This paper explores agentic system workflows in the financial services industry. In particular, we build agentic crews with human-in-the-loop module that can effectively collaborate to perform complex modeling and model risk management (MRM) tasks. The modeling crew consists of a judge agent and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection/hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation. The MRM crew consists of a judge agent along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of modeling and MRM crews by presenting a series of numerical examples applied to credit card fraud detection, credit card approval, and portfolio credit risk modeling datasets.

Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.

Abstract: Cancer evolves continuously over time through a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, microenvironmental, and phenotypic changes. This dynamic behavior drives uncontrolled cell growth, metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance, posing challenges for effective monitoring and treatment. However, today's data-driven research in oncology has primarily focused on cross-sectional analysis using data from a single modality, limiting the ability to fully characterize and interpret the disease's dynamic heterogeneity. Advances in multiscale data collection and computational methods now enable the discovery of longitudinal multimodal biomarkers for precision oncology. Longitudinal data reveal patterns of disease progression and treatment response that are not evident from single-timepoint data, enabling timely abnormality detection and dynamic treatment adaptation. Multimodal data integration offers complementary information from diverse sources for more precise risk assessment and targeting of cancer therapy. In this review, we survey methods of longitudinal and multimodal modeling, highlighting their synergy in providing multifaceted insights for personalized care tailored to the unique characteristics of a patient's cancer. We summarize the current challenges and future directions of longitudinal multimodal analysis in advancing precision oncology.

<title>Visual Adaptive Prompting for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in learning joint representations of visual and textual data, making them powerful tools for tasks such as Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). CZSL requires models to generalize to novel combinations of visual primitives-such as attributes and objects-that were not explicitly encountered during training. Recent works in prompting for CZSL have focused on modifying inputs for the text encoder, often using static prompts that do not change across varying visual contexts. However, these approaches struggle to fully capture varying visual contexts, as they focus on text adaptation rather than leveraging visual features for compositional reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual Adaptive Prompting System (VAPS) that leverages a learnable visual prompt repository and similarity-based retrieval mechanism within the framework of VLMs to bridge the gap between semantic and visual features. Our method introduces a dynamic visual prompt repository mechanism that selects the most relevant attribute and object prompts based on the visual features of the image. Our proposed system includes a visual prompt adapter that encourages the model to learn a more generalizable embedding space. Experiments on three CZSL benchmarks, across both closed and open-world scenarios, demonstrate state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.

Abstract: Realistic Hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods. Demo videos are available as supplementary material and the code is provided at https://han-dongheun.github.io/ForceGrip.

Abstract: Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at point-prompted segmentation, while text-based models, often leveraging powerful multimodal encoders like BEIT-3, provide rich semantic understanding. However, effectively combining these complementary modalities remains a challenge. This paper introduces BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework employing an explicit selection mechanism. We leverage SAM's ability to generate multiple mask candidates from a single point prompt and use a text-guided mask (generated via EVF-SAM with BEIT-3) to select the point-generated mask that best aligns spatially, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU). This approach, interpretable as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE), effectively fuses spatial precision and semantic context without complex model modifications. Notably, our method achieves strong zero-shot performance on the Endovis17 medical dataset (89.55% mDice, 81.46% mIoU) using only a single point prompt per instance. This significantly reduces annotation burden compared to bounding boxes and aligns better with practical clinical workflows, demonstrating the method's effectiveness without domain-specific training. On the RefCOCO series, BiPrompt-SAM attained 87.1%, 86.5%, and 85.8% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Experiments show BiPrompt-SAM excels in scenarios requiring both spatial accuracy and semantic disambiguation, offering a simple, effective, and interpretable perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.

Abstract: This paper assesses the performance of five machine learning classifiers: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest using latent representations learned by a Variational Autoencoder from malware datasets. Results from the experiments conducted on different training-test splits with different random seeds reveal that all the models perform well in detecting malware with ensemble methods (LightGBM and Random Forest) performing slightly better than the rest. In addition, the use of latent features reduces the computational cost of the model and the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning for improved efficiency of the model for deployment. Statistical tests show that these improvements are significant, and thus, the practical relevance of integrating latent space representation with traditional classifiers for effective malware detection in cybersecurity is established.

Abstract: The rise of LLM-driven AI characters raises safety concerns, particularly for vulnerable human users with psychological disorders. To address these risks, we propose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two components: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying mentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and after interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates, underscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is available at: https://github.com/1akaman/EmoAgent

Abstract: Generative retrieval methods utilize generative sequential modeling techniques, such as transformers, to generate candidate items for recommender systems. These methods have demonstrated promising results in academic benchmarks, surpassing traditional retrieval models like two-tower architectures. However, current generative retrieval methods lack the scalability required for industrial recommender systems, and they are insufficiently flexible to satisfy the multiple metric requirements of modern systems. This paper introduces PinRec, a novel generative retrieval model developed for applications at Pinterest. PinRec utilizes outcome-conditioned generation, enabling modelers to specify how to balance various outcome metrics, such as the number of saves and clicks, to effectively align with business goals and user exploration. Additionally, PinRec incorporates multi-token generation to enhance output diversity while optimizing generation. Our experiments demonstrate that PinRec can successfully balance performance, diversity, and efficiency, delivering a significant positive impact to users using generative models. This paper marks a significant milestone in generative retrieval, as it presents, to our knowledge, the first rigorous study on implementing generative retrieval at the scale of Pinterest.

Abstract: The advancement of AI systems for mental health support is hindered by limited access to therapeutic conversation data, particularly for trauma treatment. We present Thousand Voices of Trauma, a synthetic benchmark dataset of 3,000 therapy conversations based on Prolonged Exposure therapy protocols for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The dataset comprises 500 unique cases, each explored through six conversational perspectives that mirror the progression of therapy from initial anxiety to peak distress to emotional processing. We incorporated diverse demographic profiles (ages 18-80, M=49.3, 49.4% male, 44.4% female, 6.2% non-binary), 20 trauma types, and 10 trauma-related behaviors using deterministic and probabilistic generation methods. Analysis reveals realistic distributions of trauma types (witnessing violence 10.6%, bullying 10.2%) and symptoms (nightmares 23.4%, substance abuse 20.8%). Clinical experts validated the dataset's therapeutic fidelity, highlighting its emotional depth while suggesting refinements for greater authenticity. We also developed an emotional trajectory benchmark with standardized metrics for evaluating model responses. This privacy-preserving dataset addresses critical gaps in trauma-focused mental health data, offering a valuable resource for advancing both patient-facing applications and clinician training tools.

Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.

Abstract: An important capacity in visual object recognition is invariance to image-altering variables which leave the identity of objects unchanged, such as lighting, rotation, and scale. How do neural networks achieve this? Prior mechanistic interpretability research has illuminated some invariance-building circuitry in InceptionV1, but the results are limited and networks with different architectures have remained largely unexplored. This work investigates ResNet18 with a particular focus on its residual stream, an architectural component which InceptionV1 lacks. We observe that many convolutional channels in intermediate blocks exhibit scale invariant properties, computed by the element-wise residual summation of scale equivariant representations: the block input's smaller-scale copy with the block pre-sum output's larger-scale copy. Through subsequent ablation experiments, we attempt to causally link these neural properties with scale-robust object recognition behavior. Our tentative findings suggest how the residual stream computes scale invariance and its possible role in behavior. Code is available at: https://github.com/cest-andre/residual-stream-interp

<div> Pattern Embedded Neural Networks, multivariate nonparametric regression, missing covariates, imputation technique, excess risk bound

Summary:
Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs) are proposed for multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates. PENNs utilize neural networks trained on imputed data and pass observation indicators through a second network for a compact representation. A theoretical result shows that PENNs achieve the minimax rate of convergence, even without prior knowledge of observation patterns. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant improvements over standard neural networks. The method's code and tutorial are publicly available. <div>

Abstract: In the context of multivariate nonparametric regression with missing covariates, we propose Pattern Embedded Neural Networks (PENNs), which can be applied in conjunction with any existing imputation technique. In addition to a neural network trained on the imputed data, PENNs pass the vectors of observation indicators through a second neural network to provide a compact representation. The outputs are then combined in a third neural network to produce final predictions. Our main theoretical result exploits an assumption that the observation patterns can be partitioned into cells on which the Bayes regression function behaves similarly, and belongs to a compositional H\"older class. It provides a finite-sample excess risk bound that holds for an arbitrary missingness mechanism, and in combination with a complementary minimax lower bound, demonstrates that our PENN estimator attains in typical cases the minimax rate of convergence as if the cells of the partition were known in advance, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the sample size. Numerical experiments on simulated, semi-synthetic and real data confirm that the PENN estimator consistently improves, often dramatically, on standard neural networks without pattern embedding. Code to reproduce our experiments, as well as a tutorial on how to apply our method, is publicly available.

Summary:
The Virology Capabilities Test (VCT) is a benchmark test created for measuring the ability of large language models (LLMs) to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. It consists of 322 questions covering fundamental virology knowledge and is challenging even for expert virologists. The LLM model OpenAI's o3 achieved a high accuracy rate on the VCT, outperforming a significant percentage of expert virologists. This capability of LLMs to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting raises governance concerns due to the dual-use nature of such skills. It can be beneficial for research but also potentially misused, highlighting the need for frameworks to regulate the use of LLMs in the life sciences field. <div>

Abstract: We present the Virology Capabilities Test (VCT), a large language model (LLM) benchmark that measures the capability to troubleshoot complex virology laboratory protocols. Constructed from the inputs of dozens of PhD-level expert virologists, VCT consists of $322$ multimodal questions covering fundamental, tacit, and visual knowledge that is essential for practical work in virology laboratories. VCT is difficult: expert virologists with access to the internet score an average of $22.1\%$ on questions specifically in their sub-areas of expertise. However, the most performant LLM, OpenAI's o3, reaches $43.8\%$ accuracy, outperforming $94\%$ of expert virologists even within their sub-areas of specialization. The ability to provide expert-level virology troubleshooting is inherently dual-use: it is useful for beneficial research, but it can also be misused. Therefore, the fact that publicly available models outperform virologists on VCT raises pressing governance considerations. We propose that the capability of LLMs to provide expert-level troubleshooting of dual-use virology work should be integrated into existing frameworks for handling dual-use technologies in the life sciences.

Summary: <br />
The paper presents a novel approach to developing an interpretable neural network-based behavior detection model. The model aims to detect gaming-the-system behavior in education using fully interpretable parameters that capture the model's learned knowledge. By implementing constraints that simplify the inference process and align the model with human understanding, the approach successfully identifies patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior. The model's performance is evaluated, showing its ability to provide faithful and intelligible explanations. Comparison with human experts' findings further validates the model's effectiveness in detecting target behavior. The paper discusses the implications of the approach and suggests utilizing a human-grounded evaluation method to assess explainability in machine learning models. <div>
arXiv:2504.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of complex machine learning models in education has led to concerns about their interpretability, which in turn has spurred interest in developing explainability techniques that are both faithful to the model's inner workings and intelligible to human end-users. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to creating a neural-network-based behavior detection model that is interpretable by design. Our model is fully interpretable, meaning that the parameters we extract for our explanations have a clear interpretation, fully capture the model's learned knowledge about the learner behavior of interest, and can be used to create explanations that are both faithful and intelligible. We achieve this by implementing a series of constraints to the model that both simplify its inference process and bring it closer to a human conception of the task at hand. We train the model to detect gaming-the-system behavior, evaluate its performance on this task, and compare its learned patterns to those identified by human experts. Our results show that the model is successfully able to learn patterns indicative of gaming-the-system behavior while providing evidence for fully interpretable explanations. We discuss the implications of our approach and suggest ways to evaluate explainability using a human-grounded approach.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on improving the Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) model by incorporating gated recurrent units (LSTMs and GRUs) to enhance the capture of long-term dependencies. The implementation is revamped using the PyTorch framework for improved extensibility and reproducibility. Various optimization algorithms, including SGD, RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, and AdamW, are benchmarked to assess their impact on model convergence speed and predictive accuracy in educational tasks. Results from experiments on Synthetic-5 and Khan Academy datasets indicate that LSTMs and GRUs outperform basic RNNs in accuracy and training stability. Furthermore, adaptive optimizers like Adam and AdamW show consistent improvement over SGD in both early-stage learning and overall model performance. The open-source PyTorch implementation provided in this work offers a reliable foundation for future research in neural knowledge tracing and personalized learning systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) models student learning behavior by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict future performance based on historical interaction data. However, the original implementation relied on standard RNNs in the Lua-based Torch framework, which limited extensibility and reproducibility. In this work, we revisit the DKT model from two perspectives: architectural improvements and optimization efficiency. First, we enhance the model using gated recurrent units, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which better capture long-term dependencies and help mitigate vanishing gradient issues. Second, we re-implement DKT using the PyTorch framework, enabling a modular and accessible infrastructure compatible with modern deep learning workflows. We also benchmark several optimization algorithms SGD, RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, and AdamW to evaluate their impact on convergence speed and predictive accuracy in educational modeling tasks. Experiments on the Synthetic-5 and Khan Academy datasets show that GRUs and LSTMs achieve higher accuracy and improved training stability compared to basic RNNs, while adaptive optimizers such as Adam and AdamW consistently outperform SGD in both early-stage learning and final model performance. Our open-source PyTorch implementation provides a reproducible and extensible foundation for future research in neural knowledge tracing and personalized learning systems.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces StarPO, a framework for trajectory-level agent reinforcement learning (RL) training, focusing on large language models (LLMs). The research presents RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents in multi-turn RL tasks. The study identifies a recurring issue termed Echo Trap in agent RL training, which is addressed by a stabilized variant, StarPO-S. The shaping of RL rollouts is found to benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity, and frequent sampling. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals in enabling agent reasoning to emerge in multi-turn RL scenarios, preventing agents from adopting shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts. The code and environments used in the study are available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents presents unique challenges including long-horizon decision making and interacting with stochastic environment feedback. While reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled progress in static tasks, multi-turn agent RL training remains underexplored. We propose StarPO (State-Thinking-Actions-Reward Policy Optimization), a general framework for trajectory-level agent RL, and introduce RAGEN, a modular system for training and evaluating LLM agents. Our study on three stylized environments reveals three core findings. First, our agent RL training shows a recurring mode of Echo Trap where reward variance cliffs and gradient spikes; we address this with StarPO-S, a stabilized variant with trajectory filtering, critic incorporation, and decoupled clipping. Second, we find the shaping of RL rollouts would benefit from diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity and more frequent sampling. Third, we show that without fine-grained, reasoning-aware reward signals, agent reasoning hardly emerge through multi-turn RL and they may show shallow strategies or hallucinated thoughts. Code and environments are available at https://github.com/RAGEN-AI/RAGEN.

Summary:
In the paper, a novel adaptive-rank Singular Value Decomposition (ARSVD) method is introduced to address the limitations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in terms of memory and computational constraints. Unlike traditional SVD compression techniques that apply a fixed rank reduction across all layers, ARSVD dynamically selects the rank increase for fully connected layers based on energy distribution. This adaptive approach aims to balance compression and model performance by optimizing energy usage while minimizing accuracy loss on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. Results show that the ARSVD method effectively compresses models while maintaining high classification accuracy and F1-score, making it valuable for scenarios with limited computational and memory resources.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often constrained by their large memories and computational restrictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel adaptive-rank Singular Value Decomposition (ARSVD) that dynamically chooses the rank increase of the fully connected layers below a certain threshold in energy expenditure. Unlike conventional SVD compression methods that apply a fixed rank reduction in all layers, our ARSVD method uses energy distribution to adaptively select rank per layer while retaining accuracy. This is done for each layer in an effort to use as much energy as possible while maintaining the lowest accuracy loss. Such accuracy-adaptive approaches outperform traditional static rank reduction methods by providing an improved balance between compression and model performance. We first train a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 dataset and evaluate its performance using accuracy and F1-score. After applying ARSVD, our results demonstrate that the technique can achieve substantial model compression without compromising classification accuracy. These results illustrate the usefulness of ARSVD in computing scenarios where both computational and memory resources are scarce.

<div> Keywords: Differentiable Architecture Search, Flexible DARTS, Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking, Neural Architectures, Image Classification

Summary:
Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) aims to reduce prior constraints in Differentiable Architecture Search by allowing more architectural flexibility. FX-DARTS eliminates restrictions on cell topology and modifies the discretization mechanism for super-networks. The method leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework to address challenges and maintain stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks show that FX-DARTS can explore neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure. The approach enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules, opening up possibilities for the development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and exploring more powerful networks. <div>
arXiv:2504.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong priors are imposed on the search space of Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), such that cells of the same type share the same topological structure and each intermediate node retains two operators from distinct nodes. While these priors reduce optimization difficulties and improve the applicability of searched architectures, they hinder the subsequent development of automated machine learning (Auto-ML) and prevent the optimization algorithm from exploring more powerful neural networks through improved architectural flexibility. This paper aims to reduce these prior constraints by eliminating restrictions on cell topology and modifying the discretization mechanism for super-networks. Specifically, the Flexible DARTS (FX-DARTS) method, which leverages an Entropy-based Super-Network Shrinking (ESS) framework, is presented to address the challenges arising from the elimination of prior constraints. Notably, FX-DARTS enables the derivation of neural architectures without strict prior rules while maintaining the stability in the enlarged search space. Experimental results on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FX-DARTS is capable of exploring a set of neural architectures with competitive trade-offs between performance and computational complexity within a single search procedure.

<div> Keywords: neural architecture distillation, differentiable architecture search, knowledge distillation, Pareto-optimal set, CNN architecture

Summary: 
The article introduces the Differentiable Neural Architecture Distillation (DNAD) algorithm, which aims to create efficient neural networks by balancing performance and computational complexity. It combines two core algorithms, search by deleting and search by imitating, to derive optimal neural architectures. The Super-Network Progressive Shrinking (SNPS) algorithm, based on Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS), is used to generate a diverse set of architectures with flexible structures. By integrating SNPS with Knowledge Distillation (KD), DNAD minimizes behavioral differences between the super-network and a teacher network, resulting in well-performing neural architectures. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that both SNPS and DNAD achieve lower error rates with fewer parameters and Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to conventional methods. DNAD, in particular, outperforms most DARTS-based approaches by achieving a top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs.

Abstract: To meet the demand for designing efficient neural networks with appropriate trade-offs between model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) and computational complexity, the differentiable neural architecture distillation (DNAD) algorithm is developed based on two cores, namely search by deleting and search by imitating. Primarily, to derive neural architectures in a space where cells of the same type no longer share the same topology, the super-network progressive shrinking (SNPS) algorithm is developed based on the framework of differentiable architecture search (DARTS), i.e., search by deleting. Unlike conventional DARTS-based approaches which yield neural architectures with simple structures and derive only one architecture during the search procedure, SNPS is able to derive a Pareto-optimal set of architectures with flexible structures by forcing the dynamic super-network shrink from a dense structure to a sparse one progressively. Furthermore, since knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great effectiveness to train a compact network with the assistance of an over-parameterized model, we integrate SNPS with KD to formulate the DNAD algorithm, i.e., search by imitating. By minimizing behavioral differences between the super-network and teacher network, the over-fitting of one-level DARTS is avoided and well-performed neural architectures are derived. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet classification tasks demonstrate that both SNPS and DNAD are able to derive a set of architectures which achieve similar or lower error rates with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Particularly, DNAD achieves the top-1 error rate of 23.7% on ImageNet classification with a model of 6.0M parameters and 598M FLOPs, which outperforms most DARTS-based methods.

Summary:
AdaFisher is introduced as a novel adaptive second-order optimizer for training deep neural networks. By leveraging a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix, AdaFisher aims to improve convergence and generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Compared to traditional second-order optimizers, AdaFisher demonstrates remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning, making it effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling. The code for AdaFisher is openly available on GitHub. Through experiments, AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, bridging the gap between improved convergence of second-order methods and the computational efficiency required for training DNNs. <div>
arXiv:2504.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order optimization methods remain the standard for training deep neural networks (DNNs). Optimizers like Adam incorporate limited curvature information by preconditioning the stochastic gradient with a diagonal matrix. Despite the widespread adoption of first-order methods, second-order optimization algorithms often exhibit superior convergence compared to methods like Adam and SGD. However, their practicality in training DNNs is still limited by a significantly higher per-iteration computational cost compared to first-order methods. In this thesis, we present AdaFisher, a novel adaptive second-order optimizer that leverages a diagonal block-Kronecker approximation of the Fisher information matrix to adaptively precondition gradients. AdaFisher aims to bridge the gap between the improved convergence and generalization of second-order methods and the computational efficiency needed for training DNNs. Despite the traditionally slower speed of second-order optimizers, AdaFisher is effective for tasks such as image classification and language modeling, ex- hibiting remarkable stability and robustness during hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate that AdaFisher outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in both accuracy and convergence speed. The code is available from https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/AdaFisher.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study explores the interpretability of latent spaces produced by time series foundation models, focusing on their potential for visual analysis tasks. Specifically, we evaluate the MOMENT family of models, a set of transformer-based, pre-trained architectures for multivariate time series tasks such as: imputation, prediction, classification, and anomaly detection. We evaluate the capacity of these models on five datasets to capture the underlying structures in time series data within their latent space projection and validate whether fine tuning improves the clarity of the resulting embedding spaces. Notable performance improvements in terms of loss reduction were observed after fine tuning. Visual analysis shows limited improvement in the interpretability of the embeddings, requiring further work. Results suggest that, although Time Series Foundation Models such as MOMENT are robust, their latent spaces may require additional methodological refinements to be adequately interpreted, such as alternative projection techniques, loss functions, or data preprocessing strategies. Despite the limitations of MOMENT, foundation models supose a big reduction in execution time and so a great advance for interactive visual analytics.

HyboWaveNet introduces a novel deep learning framework for predicting Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by combining hyperbolic graphical neural networks and multiscale graphical wavelet transform. By mapping protein features to Lorentz space to simulate hierarchical relationships among biomolecules, the framework captures complex biological interactions. It utilizes a graph neural network under the Lorentz model to generate node feature representations and multiple views for comparative learning. The integration of wavelet transforms allows for adaptive extraction of local and global interaction features across resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HyboWaveNet over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the multi-scale graph wavelet transform module in enhancing predictive performance and generalization. This work bridges geometric deep learning and signal processing to provide a principled approach for analyzing intricate biological systems.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental for deciphering cellular functions,disease pathways,and drug discovery.Although existing neural networks and machine learning methods have achieved high accuracy in PPI prediction,their black-box nature leads to a lack of causal interpretation of the prediction results and difficulty in capturing hierarchical geometries and multi-scale dynamic interaction patterns among proteins.To address these challenges, we propose HyboWaveNet,a novel deep learning framework that collaborates with hyperbolic graphical neural networks (HGNNs) and multiscale graphical wavelet transform for robust PPI prediction. Mapping protein features to Lorentz space simulates hierarchical topological relationships among biomolecules via a hyperbolic distance metric,enabling node feature representations that better fit biological a priori.HyboWaveNet inherently simulates hierarchical and scale-free biological relationships, while the integration of wavelet transforms enables adaptive extraction of local and global interaction features across different resolutions. Our framework generates node feature representations via a graph neural network under the Lorenz model and generates pairs of positive samples under multiple different views for comparative learning, followed by further feature extraction via multi-scale graph wavelet transforms to predict potential PPIs. Experiments on public datasets show that HyboWaveNet improves over both existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate through ablation experimental studies that the multi-scale graph wavelet transform module improves the predictive performance and generalization ability of HyboWaveNet. This work links geometric deep learning and signal processing to advance PPI prediction, providing a principled approach for analyzing complex biological systems

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called Preference Vector to address the challenge of ensuring large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless. Existing approaches like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) face limitations such as performance conflicts and poor controllability. The Preference Vector framework is inspired by task arithmetic and allows for separate training on individual preferences, enabling fine-grained user-controllable adjustments. This modular approach supports seamless integration of new preferences without the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate that the Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, offers smooth control over preference trade-offs, and facilitates scalable multi-preference alignment. The framework provides a flexible and effective solution for balancing trade-offs in LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are both helpful and harmless is a critical challenge, as overly strict constraints can lead to excessive refusals, while permissive models risk generating harmful content. Existing approaches, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), attempt to balance these trade-offs but suffer from performance conflicts, limited controllability, and poor extendability. To address these issues, we propose Preference Vector, a novel framework inspired by task arithmetic. Instead of optimizing multiple preferences within a single objective, we train separate models on individual preferences, extract behavior shifts as preference vectors, and dynamically merge them at test time. This modular approach enables fine-grained, user-controllable preference adjustments and facilitates seamless integration of new preferences without retraining. Experiments show that our proposed Preference Vector framework improves helpfulness without excessive conservatism, allows smooth control over preference trade-offs, and supports scalable multi-preference alignment.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses the network capacity by transferring knowledge from a large (teacher) network to a smaller one (student). It has been mainstream that the teacher directly transfers knowledge to the student with its original distribution, which can possibly lead to incorrect predictions. In this article, we propose a logit-based distillation via swapped logit processing, namely Swapped Logit Distillation (SLD). SLD is proposed under two assumptions: (1) the wrong prediction occurs when the prediction label confidence is not the maximum; (2) the "natural" limit of probability remains uncertain as the best value addition to the target cannot be determined. To address these issues, we propose a swapped logit processing scheme. Through this approach, we find that the swap method can be effectively extended to teacher and student outputs, transforming into two teachers. We further introduce loss scheduling to boost the performance of two teachers' alignment. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks demonstrate that SLD consistently performs best among previous state-of-the-art methods.

<div> surrogate modeling, AI-driven, geometric representation learning, self-supervised, physics-based simulations

Summary:<br />
AI-driven surrogate modeling is an effective alternative to physics-based simulations for 3D design and analysis. Traditional surrogate models lack fine-scale geometric detail preservation, prompting the development of self-supervised geometric representation learning methods. This new approach decouples feature extraction from downstream tasks, using geometric reconstruction losses to guide a latent space embedding. Near-zero level sampling and a batch-adaptive attention-weighted loss function enhance the encoding of intricate design features, enabling accurate physics predictions with minimal data. Case studies in structural mechanics demonstrate the method's ability to capture design features and facilitate accurate few-shot predictions, bridging the gap between geometric and physics-based representations in data-scarce scenarios. <div>

Abstract: AI-driven surrogate modeling has become an increasingly effective alternative to physics-based simulations for 3D design, analysis, and manufacturing. These models leverage data-driven methods to predict physical quantities traditionally requiring computationally expensive simulations. However, the scarcity of labeled CAD-to-simulation datasets has driven recent advancements in self-supervised and foundation models, where geometric representation learning is performed offline and later fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. While these approaches have shown promise, their effectiveness is limited in applications requiring fine-scale geometric detail preservation. This work introduces a self-supervised geometric representation learning method designed to capture fine-scale geometric features from non-parametric 3D models. Unlike traditional end-to-end surrogate models, this approach decouples geometric feature extraction from downstream physics tasks, learning a latent space embedding guided by geometric reconstruction losses. Key elements include the essential use of near-zero level sampling and the innovative batch-adaptive attention-weighted loss function, which enhance the encoding of intricate design features. The proposed method is validated through case studies in structural mechanics, demonstrating strong performance in capturing design features and enabling accurate few-shot physics predictions. Comparisons with traditional parametric surrogate modeling highlight its potential to bridge the gap between geometric and physics-based representations, providing an effective solution for surrogate modeling in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of material properties facilitates the discovery of novel materials with tailored functionalities. Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasets an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction. This study represents the first exploration of supervised pertaining with surrogate labels in material property prediction, advancing methodology and application in the field.

The paper introduces a benchmarking framework to evaluate transferability scores across various settings systematically. Despite the numerous methods proposed for measuring transferability, their reliability and practical usefulness remain inconclusive due to differences in experimental setups, datasets, and assumptions. The framework aims to standardize assessment protocols to provide more reliable measures for model selection in cross-domain applications. Through extensive experiments, variations in the performance of different metrics are observed under various scenarios, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive evaluation approach.

Abstract: Transferability scores aim to quantify how well a model trained on one domain generalizes to a target domain. Despite numerous methods proposed for measuring transferability, their reliability and practical usefulness remain inconclusive, often due to differing experimental setups, datasets, and assumptions. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate transferability scores across diverse settings. Through extensive experiments, we observe variations in how different metrics perform under various scenarios, suggesting that current evaluation practices may not fully capture each method's strengths and limitations. Our findings underscore the value of standardized assessment protocols, paving the way for more reliable transferability measures and better-informed model selection in cross-domain applications. Additionally, we achieved a 3.5\% improvement using our proposed metric for the head-training fine-tuning experimental setup.

Summary:
The article introduces the LZ penalty, designed to reduce degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without compromising performance. This penalty is based on codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. By decoding the LZ penalty, one can sample from the residual distribution after eliminating highly compressible information. It is shown that the LZ penalty allows state-of-the-art reasoning models to operate with greedy decoding without encountering degenerate repetitions. In comparison, both the frequency penalty and repetition penalty commonly used in the industry are found to be ineffective, resulting in degenerate repetition rates as high as 4%. <div>

Abstract: We introduce the LZ penalty, a penalty specialized for reducing degenerate repetitions in autoregressive language models without loss of capability. The penalty is based on the codelengths in the LZ77 universal lossless compression algorithm. Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the LZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution after removing the information that is highly compressible. We demonstrate the LZ penalty enables state-of-the-art open-source reasoning models to operate with greedy (temperature zero) decoding without loss of capability and without instances of degenerate repetition. Both the industry-standard frequency penalty and repetition penalty are ineffective, incurring degenerate repetition rates of up to 4%.

Summary: 
The paper examines the Causal Identification algorithm's use in causal time series graphs with latent confounders, spanning infinitely many time steps. The challenge lies in determining the identifiability of causal effects across time intervals, requiring consideration of graph segments of unlimited size. A novel bound is introduced, dependent on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any causal effect. The study reveals that analyzing a constant-size segment of the graph is sufficient to ascertain the identifiability of causal effects across unbounded time intervals. This advancement contributes valuable insights for decision-making in understanding causal relationships in complex time series data. <div>
arXiv:2504.20172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the applicability of the Causal Identification algorithm to causal time series graphs with latent confounders. Since these graphs extend over infinitely many time steps, deciding whether causal effects across arbitrary time intervals are identifiable appears to require computation on graph segments of unbounded size. Even for deciding the identifiability of intervention effects on variables that are close in time, no bound is known on how many time steps in the past need to be considered. We give a first bound of this kind that only depends on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any direct or latent causal effect. More generally, we show that applying the Causal Identification algorithm to a constant-size segment of the time series graph is sufficient to decide identifiability of causal effects, even across unbounded time intervals.

Summary:
ProFi-Net is introduced as a few-shot learning framework for WiFi-based gesture recognition, addressing challenges of limited data and sparse feature representations. It utilizes a prototype-based metric learning architecture with a feature-level attention mechanism to refine the Euclidean distance by emphasizing discriminative feature dimensions. A curriculum-inspired data augmentation strategy is implemented exclusively on the query set, progressively introducing Gaussian noise of increasing magnitude to enhance generalization and robustness to overfitting.

Abstract: This paper presents ProFi-Net, a novel few-shot learning framework for WiFi-based gesture recognition that overcomes the chal- lenges of limited training data and sparse feature representations. ProFi- Net employs a prototype-based metric learning architecture enhanced with a feature-level attention mechanism, which dynamically refines the Euclidean distance by emphasizing the most discriminative feature di- mensions. Additionally, our approach introduces a curriculum-inspired data augmentation strategy exclusively on the query set. By progressively incorporating Gaussian noise of increasing magnitude, the model is ex- posed to a broader range of challenging variations, thereby improving its generalization and robustness to overfitting.

<div> Keywords: large language models, logical reasoning, Boolean logic, proof construction, template transformation <br />
Summary: 
This paper investigates the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by testing their skills in constructing proofs in Boolean logic. The study focuses on training LLMs to generate proofs given a set of assumptions and a goal, with an automated proof checker to catch errors. To overcome the scarcity of real-world proofs, a randomized procedure for synthesizing valid proofs is proposed. The use of Template Transformation, a data augmentation technique, improves the model's ability to handle complex logical expressions. Experiment results show that LLMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities for assertions with shorter proofs but struggle with more complex ones. Template transformation proves to be effective even for smaller models, highlighting its scalability across different model sizes. Overall, the study demonstrates that LLMs can learn to reason logically, albeit with varying degrees of success depending on proof complexity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). For a precisely defined yet tractable formulation, we choose the conceptually simple but technically complex task of constructing proofs in Boolean logic. A trained LLM receives as input a set of assumptions and a goal, and produces as output a proof that formally derives the goal from the assumptions. Incorrect proofs are caught by an automated proof checker. A critical obstacle for training is the scarcity of real-world proofs. We propose an efficient, randomized procedure for synthesizing valid proofs and introduce Template Transformation, a data augmentation technique that enhances the model's ability to handle complex logical expressions. The central evaluation question is whether an LLM has indeed learned to reason. We propose tests to measure the reasoning ability of a black-box LLM. By these measures, experiments demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for assertions with short proofs, which decline with proof complexity. Notably, template transformation improves accuracy even for smaller models, suggesting its effectiveness across model scales.

Summary:<br />
The Temporal Neural Operator (TNO) is introduced as an efficient neural operator for learning spatio-temporal dynamics in time-dependent PDEs. TNO addresses limitations of existing neural operators in capturing temporal dynamics, by incorporating a temporal branch into the DeepONet framework. It leverages various training strategies such as the Markov assumption, teacher forcing, and temporal bundling, while allowing conditioning on current or past states. TNO demonstrates long-range temporal extrapolation, robustness to error accumulation, resolution invariance, and the ability to handle multiple input functions through benchmarking and ablation studies on diverse example problems. This novel approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of neural operators in modeling temporal dynamics of PDEs, making them suitable for a wider range of applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Operators (NOs) are machine learning models designed to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning to map between function spaces. Neural Operators such as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have demonstrated excellent generalization properties when mapping between spatial function spaces. However, they struggle in mapping the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs, especially for time steps not explicitly seen during training. This limits their temporal accuracy as they do not leverage these dynamics in the training process. In addition, most NOs tend to be prohibitively costly to train, especially for higher-dimensional PDEs. In this paper, we propose the Temporal Neural Operator (TNO), an efficient neural operator specifically designed for spatio-temporal operator learning for time-dependent PDEs. TNO achieves this by introducing a temporal-branch to the DeepONet framework, leveraging the best architectural design choices from several other NOs, and a combination of training strategies including Markov assumption, teacher forcing, temporal bundling, and the flexibility to condition the output on the current state or past states. Through extensive benchmarking and an ablation study on a diverse set of example problems we demonstrate the TNO long range temporal extrapolation capabilities, robustness to error accumulation, resolution invariance, and flexibility to handle multiple input functions.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the analysis of financial data in a federated setting, wherein data is distributed across multiple clients or locations, and the raw data never leaves the local devices. Our primary focus is not only on the development of efficient learning frameworks (for protecting user data privacy) in the field of federated learning but also on the importance of designing models that are easier to interpret. In addition, we care about the robustness of the framework to outliers. To achieve these goals, we propose a robust federated logistic regression-based framework that strives to strike a balance between these goals. To verify the feasibility of our proposed framework, we carefully evaluate its performance not only on independently identically distributed (IID) data but also on non-IID data, especially in scenarios involving outliers. Extensive numerical results collected from multiple public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve comparable performance to those of classical centralized algorithms, such as Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Summary: 
Activation monitoring is crucial for language models due to their unpredictable and potentially unsafe behavior. Traditional linear probing methods can be enhanced by leveraging additional computation techniques such as prompted probing, sparse autoencoders, and zero-shot prompting. The study compares these methods and finds that prompted probing is most effective when inference-time compute is available, offering superior data efficiency and generalization performance. Zero-shot prompting can serve as a reasonable baseline, while sparse autoencoder-based methods outperform raw activation probing when compute is limited. Overall, the study recommends prompted probing for optimal monitoring of language model activations. <div>
arXiv:2504.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models can behave in unexpected and unsafe ways, and so it is valuable to monitor their outputs. Internal activations of language models encode additional information that could be useful for this. The baseline approach for activation monitoring is some variation of linear probing on a particular layer: starting from a labeled dataset, train a logistic regression classifier on that layer's activations. Recent work has proposed several approaches which may improve on naive linear probing, by leveraging additional computation. One class of techniques, which we call "prompted probing," leverages test time computation to improve monitoring by (1) prompting the model with a description of the monitoring task, and (2) applying a learned linear probe to resulting activations. Another class of techniques uses computation at train time: training sparse autoencoders offline to identify an interpretable basis for the activations, and e.g. max-pooling activations across tokens using that basis before applying a linear probe. However, one can also prompt the model with a description of the monitoring task and use its output directly. We develop and test novel refinements of these methods and compare them against each other. We find asking the model zero-shot is a reasonable baseline when inference-time compute is not limited; however, activation probing methods can substantially outperform this baseline given sufficient training data. Specifically, we recommend prompted probing when inference-time compute is available, due to its superior data efficiency and good generalization performance. Alternatively, if inference-time compute is limited, we find SAE-based probing methods outperform raw activation probing.

The allocation problem is framed as maximizing an ergodic utility function while adhering to Quality of Service (QoS) constraints.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving distributed model training is crucial for modern machine learning applications, yet existing Federated Learning approaches struggle with heterogeneous data distributions and varying computational capabilities. Traditional solutions either treat all participants uniformly or require costly dynamic clustering during training, leading to reduced efficiency and delayed model specialization. We present FedCCL (Federated Clustered Continual Learning), a framework specifically designed for environments with static organizational characteristics but dynamic client availability. By combining static pre-training clustering with an adapted asynchronous FedAvg algorithm, FedCCL enables new clients to immediately profit from specialized models without prior exposure to their data distribution, while maintaining reduced coordination overhead and resilience to client disconnections. Our approach implements an asynchronous Federated Learning protocol with a three-tier model topology - global, cluster-specific, and local models - that efficiently manages knowledge sharing across heterogeneous participants. Evaluation using photovoltaic installations across central Europe demonstrates that FedCCL's location-based clustering achieves an energy prediction error of 3.93% (+-0.21%), while maintaining data privacy and showing that the framework maintains stability for population-independent deployments, with 0.14 percentage point degradation in performance for new installations. The results demonstrate that FedCCL offers an effective framework for privacy-preserving distributed learning, maintaining high accuracy and adaptability even with dynamic participant populations.

<br />
Summary:<br />
Traditional k-means clustering struggles with non-convex shapes and requires pre-specification of the number of clusters. A proposed geometric enhancement involves assigning radii to cluster centers after standard k-means and merging clusters with overlapping radii, allowing for flexibility in the number of clusters. This method can reconstruct non-convex shapes by meaningful merges with an overestimated k. The approach also supports recursive partitioning by independently clustering tiled regions of the feature space and globally merging them, enabling scalability and distribution. Implemented as a lightweight post-processing step on scikit-learn's k-means, the algorithm performs well on benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy with minimal additional computation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traditional k-means clustering underperforms on non-convex shapes and requires the number of clusters k to be specified in advance. We propose a simple geometric enhancement: after standard k-means, each cluster center is assigned a radius (the distance to its farthest assigned point), and clusters whose radii overlap are merged. This post-processing step loosens the requirement for exact k: as long as k is overestimated (but not excessively), the method can often reconstruct non-convex shapes through meaningful merges. We also show that this approach supports recursive partitioning: clustering can be performed independently on tiled regions of the feature space, then globally merged, making the method scalable and suitable for distributed systems. Implemented as a lightweight post-processing step atop scikit-learn's k-means, the algorithm performs well on benchmark datasets, achieving high accuracy with minimal additional computation.

<div> Keywords: Digital twins, water distribution systems, Long Short-Term Memory networks, adversarial attacks, cybersecurity risks

Summary:
Digital twins are being used to optimize water distribution systems by utilizing real-time data and prediction models. A DT platform designed for a Spanish water supply network incorporates LSTM networks for water consumption prediction. However, machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks like FGSM and PGD, which can manipulate model parameters and degrade forecasting accuracy. To enhance these vulnerabilities, a LA-based approach dynamically adjusts perturbations to make attacks harder to detect. Experimental results show a significant increase in prediction errors, with MAPE rising from 26% to over 35%. Adaptive attack strategies further amplify this impact, underscoring cybersecurity risks in AI-driven DTs. This highlights the essential need for robust defenses, including adversarial training, anomaly detection, and secure data pipelines.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) are improving water distribution systems by using real-time data, analytics, and prediction models to optimize operations. This paper presents a DT platform designed for a Spanish water supply network, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict water consumption. However, machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). These attacks manipulate critical model parameters, injecting subtle distortions that degrade forecasting accuracy. To further exploit these vulnerabilities, we introduce a Learning Automata (LA) and Random LA-based approach that dynamically adjusts perturbations, making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. Experimental results show that this approach significantly impacts prediction reliability, causing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to rise from 26% to over 35%. Moreover, adaptive attack strategies amplify this effect, highlighting cybersecurity risks in AI-driven DTs. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust defenses, including adversarial training, anomaly detection, and secure data pipelines.

Summary:
FigBO is a new generalized acquisition function in Bayesian optimization that looks ahead to consider the future impact of candidate points on global information gain. It can be easily integrated with existing myopic acquisition functions. Theoretical analysis shows that FigBO has better regret bound and convergence rate compared to standard expected improvement (EI). Empirical experiments across various tasks demonstrate that FigBO achieves state-of-the-art performance and converges significantly faster than existing methods. The plug-and-play nature of FigBO makes it a promising addition to the field of Bayesian optimization. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, consisting of two main components: a surrogate model and an acquisition function. In recent years, myopic acquisition functions have been widely adopted for their simplicity and effectiveness. However, their lack of look-ahead capability limits their performance. To address this limitation, we propose FigBO, a generalized acquisition function that incorporates the future impact of candidate points on global information gain. FigBO is a plug-and-play method that can integrate seamlessly with most existing myopic acquisition functions. Theoretically, we analyze the regret bound and convergence rate of FigBO when combined with the myopic base acquisition function expected improvement (EI), comparing them to those of standard EI. Empirically, extensive experimental results across diverse tasks demonstrate that FigBO achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly faster convergence compared to existing methods.

<div> Detection, Mitigation, Adversarial Inputs, Machine Learning, Cryptography

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce a theoretical study on the detection and mitigation of adversarial inputs in Machine Learning algorithms during inference time. They define defense by detection (DbD) and defense by mitigation (DbM) through a 3-round protocol involving a trainer/defender and an attacker. The goal is to defend against inputs that deceive the training algorithm while maintaining performance on training data. The study shows that achieving DbD and DbM are equivalent for classification tasks but not for generative learning tasks due to multiple possible correct outputs. A separation between DbD and DbM is demonstrated in a generative learning task, where defense by mitigation is possible but defense by detection is not feasible under certain cryptographic assumptions. The mitigation phase successfully reduces the number of samples required compared to the initial training algorithm. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we initiate a cryptographically inspired theoretical study of detection versus mitigation of adversarial inputs produced by attackers of Machine Learning algorithms during inference time.
  We formally define defense by detection (DbD) and defense by mitigation (DbM). Our definitions come in the form of a 3-round protocol between two resource-bounded parties: a trainer/defender and an attacker. The attacker aims to produce inference-time inputs that fool the training algorithm. We define correctness, completeness, and soundness properties to capture successful defense at inference time while not degrading (too much) the performance of the algorithm on inputs from the training distribution.
  We first show that achieving DbD and achieving DbM are equivalent for ML classification tasks. Surprisingly, this is not the case for ML generative learning tasks, where there are many possible correct outputs that can be generated for each input. We show a separation between DbD and DbM by exhibiting a generative learning task for which is possible to defend by mitigation but is provably impossible to defend by detection under the assumption that the Identity-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (IB-FHE), publicly-verifiable zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) and Strongly Unforgeable Signatures exist. The mitigation phase uses significantly fewer samples than the initial training algorithm.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges faced by zeroth-order optimization (ZO) due to the high demand for Gaussian random numbers, making it infeasible for certain hardware platforms. The proposed solution, PeZO, addresses this issue by utilizing random number reuse strategies to reduce the need for random number generation and introducing an adaptive scaling method to replace the Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Experimental results show significant reductions in required resources for random number generation and power consumption without compromising training performance. This makes ZO optimization feasible for on-device training, presenting valuable insights for future research on enhancing the efficiency of deep neural network training on hardware platforms. <div>
arXiv:2504.20314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is an emerging deep neural network (DNN) training paradigm that offers computational simplicity and memory savings. However, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored challenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random numbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for hardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this critical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware designers. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO framework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to significantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a hardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian distribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO reduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\% and 12.7\%, and saves at maximum 86\% power consumption, all without compromising training performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of on-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a hybrid Bayesian experimental design (BED) framework for optimizing data acquisition in the presence of model discrepancy. By utilizing auto-differentiable ensemble Kalman inversion (AD-EKI), the framework addresses the challenge of high-dimensional parameter space, enabling computationally efficient estimation of information gain. The AD-EKI allows for a differentiable evaluation of the utility function in BED, facilitating the use of gradient-based methods for design optimization. The proposed hybrid framework separates the inference of low-dimensional physical parameters from the high-dimensional model discrepancy, enabling the identification of optimal experimental designs for calibrating the model discrepancy. The method is demonstrated on a convection-diffusion example, showcasing its ability to efficiently calibrate the model discrepancy and infer unknown physical parameters. This approach not only addresses the issue of model discrepancy in BED but also has broader applications in bilevel optimization problems. <div>
arXiv:2504.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian experimental design (BED) offers a principled framework for optimizing data acquisition by leveraging probabilistic inference. However, practical implementations of BED are often compromised by model discrepancy, i.e., the mismatch between predictive models and true physical systems, which can potentially lead to biased parameter estimates. While data-driven approaches have been recently explored to characterize the model discrepancy, the resulting high-dimensional parameter space poses severe challenges for both Bayesian updating and design optimization. In this work, we propose a hybrid BED framework enabled by auto-differentiable ensemble Kalman inversion (AD-EKI) that addresses these challenges by providing a computationally efficient, gradient-free alternative to estimate the information gain for high-dimensional network parameters. The AD-EKI allows a differentiable evaluation of the utility function in BED and thus facilitates the use of standard gradient-based methods for design optimization. In the proposed hybrid framework, we iteratively optimize experimental designs, decoupling the inference of low-dimensional physical parameters handled by standard BED methods, from the high-dimensional model discrepancy handled by AD-EKI. The identified optimal designs for the model discrepancy enable us to systematically collect informative data for its calibration. The performance of the proposed method is studied by a classical convection-diffusion BED example, and the hybrid framework enabled by AD-EKI efficiently identifies informative data to calibrate the model discrepancy and robustly infers the unknown physical parameters in the modeled system. Besides addressing the challenges of BED with model discrepancy, AD-EKI also potentially fosters efficient and scalable frameworks in many other areas with bilevel optimization, such as meta-learning and structure optimization.

<div> slow manifolds, model reduction, multiscale algorithms, conditional score-based generative models, bifurcation diagrams
Summary: 
This article discusses the use of conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) in sampling slow manifolds and steady states in dynamical systems with time scale separation. By employing cSGMs, researchers can efficiently initialize on low-dimensional slow manifolds and approximate steady states in bifurcation diagrams based on desired parameters. This approach can aid in understanding the geometry of reduced slow manifolds and filling in missing segments of steady states in bifurcation diagrams. The framework presented in this work integrates machine learning techniques with traditional numerical nonlinear dynamics methods, enhancing the capability to explore system attractors and model reduction. <div>
arXiv:2504.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamical systems characterized by separation of time scales, the approximation of so called ``slow manifolds'', on which the long term dynamics lie, is a useful step for model reduction. Initializing on such slow manifolds is a useful step in modeling, since it circumvents fast transients, and is crucial in multiscale algorithms alternating between fine scale (fast) and coarser scale (slow) simulations. In a similar spirit, when one studies the infinite time dynamics of systems depending on parameters, the system attractors (e.g., its steady states) lie on bifurcation diagrams. Sampling these manifolds gives us representative attractors (here, steady states of ODEs or PDEs) at different parameter values. Algorithms for the systematic construction of these manifolds are required parts of the ``traditional'' numerical nonlinear dynamics toolkit.
  In more recent years, as the field of Machine Learning develops, conditional score-based generative models (cSGMs) have demonstrated capabilities in generating plausible data from target distributions that are conditioned on some given label. It is tempting to exploit such generative models to produce samples of data distributions conditioned on some quantity of interest (QoI). In this work, we present a framework for using cSGMs to quickly (a) initialize on a low-dimensional (reduced-order) slow manifold of a multi-time-scale system consistent with desired value(s) of a QoI (a ``label'') on the manifold, and (b) approximate steady states in a bifurcation diagram consistent with a (new, out-of-sample) parameter value. This conditional sampling can help uncover the geometry of the reduced slow-manifold and/or approximately ``fill in'' missing segments of steady states in a bifurcation diagram.

Additionally, the framework maximizes the Schatten p-norm of labels to maintain class balance during clustering, supported by a theoretical proof.

arXiv:2504.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifold clustering, with its exceptional ability to capture complex data structures, holds a pivotal position in cluster analysis. However, existing methods often focus only on finding the optimal combination between K-means and manifold learning, and overlooking the consistency between the data structure and labels. To address this issue, we deeply explore the relationship between K-means and manifold learning, and on this basis, fuse them to develop a new clustering framework. Specifically, the algorithm uses labels to guide the manifold structure and perform clustering on it, which ensures the consistency between the data structure and labels. Furthermore, in order to naturally maintain the class balance in the clustering process, we maximize the Schatten p-norm of labels, and provide a theoretical proof to support this. Additionally, our clustering framework is designed to be flexible and compatible with many types of distance functions, which facilitates efficient processing of nonlinear separable data. The experimental results of several databases confirm the superiority of our proposed model.

arXiv:2504.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation, a fundamental model in kinetic theory, describes the evolution of particle distribution functions through a nonlinear, high-dimensional collision operator. However, its numerical solution remains computationally demanding, particularly for inelastic collisions and high-dimensional velocity domains. In this work, we propose the Fourier Neural Spectral Network (FourierSpecNet), a hybrid framework that integrates the Fourier spectral method with deep learning to approximate the collision operator in Fourier space efficiently. FourierSpecNet achieves resolution-invariant learning and supports zero-shot super-resolution, enabling accurate predictions at unseen resolutions without retraining. Beyond empirical validation, we establish a consistency result showing that the trained operator converges to the spectral solution as the discretization is refined. We evaluate our method on several benchmark cases, including Maxwellian and hard-sphere molecular models, as well as inelastic collision scenarios. The results demonstrate that FourierSpecNet offers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional spectral solvers. Our approach provides a robust and scalable alternative for solving the Boltzmann equation across both elastic and inelastic regimes.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to modeling temporal point processes using diffusion models with an asynchronous noise schedule. At each step of the diffusion process, the noise schedule injects noise of varying scales into different parts of the data. With a careful design of the noise schedules, earlier events are generated faster than later ones, thus providing stronger conditioning for forecasting the more distant future. We derive an objective to effectively train these models for a general family of noise schedules based on conditional flow matching. Our method models the joint distribution of the latent representations of events in a sequence and achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting both the next inter-event time and event type on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it flexibly accommodates varying lengths of observation and prediction windows in different forecasting settings by adjusting the starting and ending points of the generation process. Finally, our method shows superior performance in long-horizon prediction tasks, outperforming existing baseline methods.

Summary: 
Homophily is an essential measure in understanding graph neural networks (GNNs), but its analysis has been limited to static graphs. This study explores homophily in dynamic settings and introduces dynamic homophily as a new measure. The discriminative performance of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in dynamic settings is linked to the probability of a node's future label matching its neighbors' current labels. By examining various dynamic node classification datasets, it is found that popular GNNs are not resilient to low dynamic homophily. The research offers insights on enhancing GNN design for dynamic graphs, shedding light on the importance of homophily in GNN performance in dynamic node classification tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Homophily, as a measure, has been critical to increasing our understanding of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, to date this measure has only been analyzed in the context of static graphs. In our work, we explore homophily in dynamic settings. Focusing on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), we demonstrate theoretically that in dynamic settings, current GCN discriminative performance is characterized by the probability that a node's future label is the same as its neighbors' current labels. Based on this insight, we propose dynamic homophily, a new measure of homophily that applies in the dynamic setting. This new measure correlates with GNN discriminative performance and sheds light on how to potentially design more powerful GNNs for dynamic graphs. Leveraging a variety of dynamic node classification datasets, we demonstrate that popular GNNs are not robust to low dynamic homophily. Going forward, our work represents an important step towards understanding homophily and GNN performance in dynamic node classification.

Abstract: In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that current graph positional encodings (PEs) are not beneficial and could potentially hurt performance in tasks involving heterophilous graphs, where nodes that are close tend to have different labels. This limitation is critical as many real-world networks exhibit heterophily, and even highly homophilous graphs can contain local regions of strong heterophily. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable Laplacian Positional Encodings (LLPE), a new PE that leverages the full spectrum of the graph Laplacian, enabling them to capture graph structure on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. Theoretically, we prove LLPE's ability to approximate a general class of graph distances and demonstrate its generalization properties. Empirically, our evaluation on 12 benchmarks demonstrates that LLPE improves accuracy across a variety of GNNs, including graph transformers, by up to 35% and 14% on synthetic and real-world graphs, respectively. Going forward, our work represents a significant step towards developing PEs that effectively capture complex structures in heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language understanding and generation but face significant memory bottlenecks during training. GaLore, Gradient Low-Rank Projection, addresses this issue by leveraging the inherent low-rank structure of weight gradients, enabling substantial memory savings without sacrificing performance. Recent works further extend GaLore from various aspects, including low-bit quantization and higher-order tensor structures. However, there are several remaining challenges for GaLore, such as the computational overhead of SVD for subspace updates and the integration with state-of-the-art training parallelization strategies (e.g., FSDP). In this paper, we present GaLore 2, an efficient and scalable GaLore framework that addresses these challenges and incorporates recent advancements. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of GaLore 2 by pre-training Llama 7B from scratch using up to 500 billion training tokens, highlighting its potential impact on real LLM pre-training scenarios.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel multidimensional precipitation index prediction model based on a CNN-LSTM hybrid framework to enhance the accuracy of precipitation forecasts, focusing on Pune, Maharashtra, India, from 1972 to 2002. The dataset covers monthly mean precipitation data and the model effectively captures local features and long-term dependencies in the time series data. Results show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy over traditional methods, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.752. However, the model requires high computational resources for large-scale datasets and needs further enhancement for predicting multidimensional precipitation data.

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of weather indicators is of great significance in disaster prevention and mitigation, agricultural production, and transportation. Precipitation, as one of the key meteorological indicators, plays a crucial role in water resource management, agricultural production, and urban flood control. This study proposes a multidimensional precipitation index prediction model based on a CNN- LSTM hybrid framework, aiming to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts. The dataset is sourced from Pune, Maharashtra, India, covering monthly mean precipitation data from 1972 to 2002. This dataset includes nearly 31 years (1972-2002) of monthly average precipitation, reflecting the long-term fluctuations and seasonal variations of precipitation in the region. By analyzing these time series data, the CNN-LSTM model effectively captures local features and long-term dependencies. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.752, which demonstrates a significant advantage over traditional time series prediction methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Furthermore, this study provides new research ideas for precipitation prediction. However, the model requires high computational resources when dealing with large-scale datasets, and its predictive ability for multidimensional precipitation data still needs improvement. Future research could extend the model to support and predict multidimensional precipitation data, thereby promoting the development of more accurate and efficient meteorological prediction technologies.

Summary:
Intelligent fault-tolerant (FT) computing is crucial for reliable service delivery. Existing deep learning-based FT algorithms face challenges due to the complexity of fault knowledge and time series log data. In response, FT-MoE, a sustainable-learning mixture-of-experts model, is proposed. It leverages decoder-based transformer models to extract fault prototype vectors and utilizes dual mixture of experts networks for accurate fault prediction. A two-stage optimization scheme enables offline training and online tuning to adapt to dynamic service environments.

Abstract: Intelligent fault-tolerant (FT) computing has recently demonstrated significant advantages of predicting and diagnosing faults in advance, enabling reliable service delivery. However, due to heterogeneity of fault knowledge and complex dependence relationships of time series log data, existing deep learning-based FT algorithms further improve detection performance relying on single neural network model with difficulty. To this end, we propose FT-MoE, a sustainable-learning mixture-of-experts model for fault-tolerant computing with multiple tasks, which enables different parameters learning distinct fault knowledge to achieve high-reliability for service system. Firstly, we use decoder-based transformer models to obtain fault prototype vectors of decoupling long-distance dependencies. Followed by, we present a dual mixture of experts networks for high-accurate prediction for both fault detection and classification tasks. Then, we design a two-stage optimization scheme of offline training and online tuning, which allows that in operation FT-MoE can also keep learning to adapt to dynamic service environments. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of FT-MoE, we conduct extensive experiments on the FT benchmark. Experimental results show that FT-MoE achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available upon publication.

<br />
Summary: 
The study explores the challenge of sampling tokens in arbitrary-order language models. It introduces Any-Subset Autoregressive Models (AS-ARMs) that allow for generating tokens in any order and in parallel. These models support parallelized joint probability density estimation through the Any-Subset Speculative Decoding (ASSD) algorithm, enabling correction of parallel-generated token distributions. ASSD ensures generation of tokens from the correct joint distribution with a limited number of neural network calls. Empirical results showcase that AS-ARMs speed up language generation while maintaining quality. A mathematically justified training scheme is provided for AS-ARMs, leading to state-of-the-art performance on infilling tasks and competitive results on code generation tasks. The findings highlight AS-ARMs as a promising area in language modeling, offering efficient and effective token generation in complex language tasks. <div>
arXiv:2504.20456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arbitrary-order language models, it is an open question how to sample tokens in parallel from the correct joint distribution. With discrete diffusion models, the more tokens they generate in parallel, the less their predicted distributions adhere to the originally learned data distribution, as they rely on a conditional independence assumption that only works with infinitesimally small timesteps. We find that a different class of models, any-subset autoregressive models (AS-ARMs), holds the solution. As implied by the name, AS-ARMs can generate tokens in any order, and in parallel. Moreover, AS-ARMs support parallelized joint probability density estimation, allowing them to correct their own parallel-generated token distributions, via our Any-Subset Speculative Decoding (ASSD) algorithm. ASSD provably enables generation of tokens from the correct joint distribution, with the number of neural network calls upper bounded by the number of tokens predicted. We empirically verify that ASSD speeds up language generation, without sacrificing quality. Furthermore, we provide a mathematically justified scheme for training AS-ARMs for generation, and show that AS-ARMs achieve state-of-the-art performance among sub-200M parameter models on infilling benchmark tasks, and nearly match the performance of models 50X larger on code generation. Our theoretical and empirical results indicate that the once-forgotten AS-ARMs are a promising direction of language modeling.

Abstract: Causal effect estimation has been widely used in marketing optimization. The framework of an uplift model followed by a constrained optimization algorithm is popular in practice. To enhance performance in the online environment, the framework needs to be improved to address the complexities caused by temporal dataset shift. This paper focuses on capturing the dataset shift from user behavior and domain distribution changing over time. We propose an Incremental Causal Effect with Proxy Knowledge Distillation (ICE-PKD) framework to tackle this challenge. The ICE-PKD framework includes two components: (i) a multi-treatment uplift network that eliminates confounding bias using counterfactual regression; (ii) an incremental training strategy that adapts to the temporal dataset shift by updating with the latest data and protects generalization via replay-based knowledge distillation. We also revisit the uplift modeling metrics and introduce a novel metric for more precise online evaluation in multiple treatment scenarios. Extensive experiments on both simulated and online datasets show that the proposed framework achieves better performance. The ICE-PKD framework has been deployed in the marketing system of Huaxiaozhu, a ride-hailing platform in China.

Summary:
Group Relative Knowledge Distillation (GRKD) proposes a novel framework for transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model by focusing on relative ranking among classes rather than absolute probabilities. By introducing a group relative loss that preserves pairwise preference orderings provided by the teacher's outputs, GRKD aims to capture valuable relational inductive biases embedded in the teacher's predictions. The method outperforms existing distillation approaches in terms of generalization, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained class differentiation. By emphasizing the relational structure of teacher knowledge rather than absolute likelihood, GRKD offers a new perspective on knowledge transfer in distillation techniques. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model by minimizing differences between their output distributions. However, existing distillation approaches largely focus on mimicking absolute probabilities and neglect the valuable relational inductive biases embedded in the teacher's relative predictions, leading to exposure bias. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Knowledge Distillation (GRKD), a novel framework that distills teacher knowledge by learning the relative ranking among classes, rather than directly fitting the absolute distribution. Specifically, we introduce a group relative loss that encourages the student model to preserve the pairwise preference orderings provided by the teacher's outputs. Extensive experiments on classification benchmarks demonstrate that GRKD achieves superior generalization compared to existing methods, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained class differentiation. Our method provides a new perspective on exploiting teacher knowledge, focusing on relational structure rather than absolute likelihood.

Summary:
The study evaluates a machine-learning method for segmenting and classifying symbolic representations of folk songs into tune families using Haar-wavelet filtering. Melodies are represented as discrete pitch-time signals, and the continuous wavelet transform with the Haar wavelet is applied to filter melodies at specific time scales. Wavelet coefficients' local maxima are used to indicate boundaries for segmentation, and k-nearest neighbours based on standard vector-metrics are employed for classification. The results of the wavelet-based method are compared to a Gestalt-based method and direct application of metrics to the pitch signal. The study finds that wavelet-based segmentation and filtering lead to improved classification accuracy in cross-validated evaluation, especially when optimizing time-scale and other parameters. This highlights the effectiveness of using wavelet filtering in machine-learning methods for analyzing folk songs.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate a machine-learning method in which symbolic representations of folk songs are segmented and classified into tune families with Haar-wavelet filtering. The method is compared with previously proposed Gestalt-based method. Melodies are represented as discrete symbolic pitch-time signals. We apply the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with the Haar wavelet at specific scales, obtaining filtered versions of melodies emphasizing their information at particular time-scales. We use the filtered signal for representation and segmentation, using the wavelet coefficients' local maxima to indicate local boundaries and classify segments by means of k-nearest neighbours based on standard vector-metrics (Euclidean, cityblock), and compare the results to a Gestalt-based segmentation method and metrics applied directly to the pitch signal. We found that the wavelet based segmentation and wavelet-filtering of the pitch signal lead to better classification accuracy in cross-validated evaluation when the time-scale and other parameters are optimized.

<div> Keywords: DeeP-Mod, Deep Dynamic Programming Network, Deep Q-Network, Dynamic Programming, Environment Model 

Summary:
The DeeP-Mod framework utilizes features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN) to build an environment model for decision-making. Unlike traditional Deep Q-Learning methods, DeeP-Mod ensures that state information is preserved by using Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques in training the DDPN. This approach allows for the extraction of state values rather than state-action pairs, leading to improved task and action set independence. Furthermore, a reduced version of the DDPN can be trained using features from the original DDPN, achieving faster convergence and outperforming the original model, particularly in noisy environments. The DeeP-Mod framework eliminates the need for an externally defined environment model, making it applicable to a wide range of environments. By learning directly from the evolutionary features of the DDPN, DeeP-Mod enables the training of an effective feature-value representation for optimal policy learning. <div>

Abstract: The DeeP-Mod framework builds an environment model using features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN), trained via a Deep Q-Network (DQN). While Deep Q-Learning is effective in decision-making, state information is lost in deeper DQN layers due to mixed state-action representations. We address this by using Dynamic Programming (DP) to train a DDPN, where Value Iteration ensures the output represents state values, not state-action pairs. Extracting features from the DDPN preserves state information, enabling task and action set independence. We show that a reduced DDPN can be trained using features extracted from the original DDPN trained on an identical problem. This reduced DDPN achieves faster convergence under noise and outperforms the original DDPN. Finally, we introduce the DeeP-Mod framework, which creates an environment model using the evolution of features extracted from a DDPN in response to actions. A second DDPN, which learns directly from this feature model rather than raw states, can learn an effective feature-value representation and thus optimal policy. A key advantage of DeeP-Mod is that an externally defined environment model is not needed at any stage, making DDPN applicable to a wide range of environments.

Summary: 
Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes while preserving knowledge of previously learned classes. Existing methods often struggle to maintain a balance between old and new knowledge in a continually updated model. The proposed method, Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), addresses this challenge by introducing a dual classifier approach for inclusive training separation. This allows for effective integration of knowledge from both old and new classes, enhancing plasticity and stability. BOIL outperforms state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods, demonstrating more balanced and improved performance. Extensive experimental evaluations across three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of BOIL in achieving a well-balanced learner in OCIL settings. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Online class-incremental learning (OCIL) focuses on gradually learning new classes (called plasticity) from a stream of data in a single-pass, while concurrently preserving knowledge of previously learned classes (called stability). The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance between the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated model. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through experience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address bias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a well-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity or limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge in the OCIL setting. In this paper, we propose a novel replay-based method, called Balanced Online Incremental Learning (BOIL), which can achieve both high plasticity and stability, thus ensuring more balanced performance in OCIL. Our BOIL method proposes an inclusive training separation strategy using dual classifiers so that knowledge from both old and new classes can effectively be integrated into the model, while introducing implicit approaches for transferring knowledge across the two classifiers. Extensive experimental evaluations over three widely-used OCIL benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of BOIL, showing more balanced yet better performance compared to state-of-the-art replay-based OCIL methods.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing uses radio-frequency signals from Wi-Fi devices to analyze environments, enabling tasks such as tracking people, detecting intrusions, and recognizing gestures. The rise of this technology is driven by the IEEE 802.11bf standard and growing demand for tools that can ensure privacy and operate through obstacles. However, the performance of Wi-Fi sensing is heavily influenced by environmental conditions, especially when extracting spatial and temporal features from the surrounding scene. A key challenge is achieving robust generalization across domains, ensuring stable performance even when the sensing environment changes significantly. This paper introduces a novel deep learning model for cross-domain adaptation of Wi-Fi signals, inspired by physical signal shielding. The model uses a Relativistic average Generative Adversarial Network (RaGAN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architectures for both the generator and discriminator. To simulate physical shielding, an acrylic box lined with electromagnetic shielding fabric was constructed, mimicking a Faraday cage. Wi-Fi signal spectra were collected from various materials both inside (domain-free) and outside (domain-dependent) the box to train the model. A multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained on domain-free spectra and tested on signals denoised by the RaGAN. The system achieved 96% accuracy and demonstrated strong material discrimination capabilities, offering potential for use in security applications to identify concealed objects based on their composition.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards using one training example (1-shot RLVR) proves effective in enhancing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The application of RLVR to model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B significantly improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Various models, RL algorithms, and math examples show substantial performance enhancements using 1-shot RLVR. Interesting phenomena such as cross-domain generalization, increased self-reflection, and post-saturation generalization are observed during training. The effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR is primarily attributed to the policy gradient loss and promoting exploration. Additionally, applying entropy loss alone enhances model performance significantly. These findings can inspire future research on RLVR data efficiency and prompt a re-evaluation of progress and underlying mechanisms in RLVR. The code, model, and data are open source for further exploration.

arXiv:2504.20571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward using one training example (1-shot RLVR) is effective in incentivizing the math reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Applying RLVR to the base model Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, we identify a single example that elevates model performance on MATH500 from 36.0% to 73.6%, and improves the average performance across six common mathematical reasoning benchmarks from 17.6% to 35.7%. This result matches the performance obtained using the 1.2k DeepScaleR subset (MATH500: 73.6%, average: 35.9%), which includes the aforementioned example. Similar substantial improvements are observed across various models (Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B), RL algorithms (GRPO and PPO), and different math examples (many of which yield approximately 30% or greater improvement on MATH500 when employed as a single training example). In addition, we identify some interesting phenomena during 1-shot RLVR, including cross-domain generalization, increased frequency of self-reflection, and sustained test performance improvement even after the training accuracy has saturated, a phenomenon we term post-saturation generalization. Moreover, we verify that the effectiveness of 1-shot RLVR primarily arises from the policy gradient loss, distinguishing it from the "grokking" phenomenon. We also show the critical role of promoting exploration (e.g., by adding entropy loss with an appropriate coefficient) in 1-shot RLVR training. As a bonus, we observe that applying entropy loss alone, without any outcome reward, significantly enhances Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B's performance on MATH500 by 27.4%. These findings can inspire future work on RLVR data efficiency and encourage a re-examination of both recent progress and the underlying mechanisms in RLVR. Our code, model, and data are open source at https://github.com/ypwang61/One-Shot-RLVR

<div> neural architectures, treatment effects, observational data, hidden confounding, covariate mismatch <br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces neural architectures to estimate treatment effects from observational data, addressing challenges such as hidden confounding and covariate mismatch. Traditional techniques rely on causal graphs for hidden confounding and methods like covariate matching for covariate mismatch, but a unified framework is lacking. The proposed neural architectures aim to learn a representation of pre-treatment covariates that serves as a valid adjustment while satisfying covariate matching constraints. By combining gradient matching with a covariate matching transformation, the models generate approximately invariant representations that yield valid adjustment sets, providing an interval around the true causal effect. This method outperforms various baselines on causal benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance in estimating Average Treatment Effects (ATE) and Precision in Estimation of Heterogeneous Effects (PEHE) on datasets including IHDP, Jobs, Cattaneo, and a Crowd Management dataset based on images. <div>
arXiv:2504.20579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating treatment effects from observational data is challenging due to two main reasons: (a) hidden confounding, and (b) covariate mismatch (control and treatment groups not having identical distributions). Long lines of works exist that address only either of these issues. To address the former, conventional techniques that require detailed knowledge in the form of causal graphs have been proposed. For the latter, covariate matching and importance weighting methods have been used. Recently, there has been progress in combining testable independencies with partial side information for tackling hidden confounding. A common framework to address both hidden confounding and selection bias is missing. We propose neural architectures that aim to learn a representation of pre-treatment covariates that is a valid adjustment and also satisfies covariate matching constraints. We combine two different neural architectures: one based on gradient matching across domains created by subsampling a suitable anchor variable that assumes causal side information, followed by the other, a covariate matching transformation. We prove that approximately invariant representations yield approximate valid adjustment sets which would enable an interval around the true causal effect. In contrast to usual sensitivity analysis, where an unknown nuisance parameter is varied, we have a testable approximation yielding a bound on the effect estimate. We also outperform various baselines with respect to ATE and PEHE errors on causal benchmarks that include IHDP, Jobs, Cattaneo, and an image-based Crowd Management dataset.

Abstract: Performative Reinforcement Learning (PRL) refers to a scenario in which the deployed policy changes the reward and transition dynamics of the underlying environment. In this work, we study multi-agent PRL by incorporating performative effects into Markov Potential Games (MPGs). We introduce the notion of a performatively stable equilibrium (PSE) and show that it always exists under a reasonable sensitivity assumption. We then provide convergence results for state-of-the-art algorithms used to solve MPGs. Specifically, we show that independent policy gradient ascent (IPGA) and independent natural policy gradient (INPG) converge to an approximate PSE in the best-iterate sense, with an additional term that accounts for the performative effects. Furthermore, we show that INPG asymptotically converges to a PSE in the last-iterate sense. As the performative effects vanish, we recover the convergence rates from prior work. For a special case of our game, we provide finite-time last-iterate convergence results for a repeated retraining approach, in which agents independently optimize a surrogate objective. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Ensuring the generalisability of clinical machine learning (ML) models across diverse healthcare settings remains a significant challenge due to variability in patient demographics, disease prevalence, and institutional practices. Existing model evaluation approaches often rely on real-world datasets, which are limited in availability, embed confounding biases, and lack the flexibility needed for systematic experimentation. Furthermore, while generative models aim for statistical realism, they often lack transparency and explicit control over factors driving distributional shifts. In this work, we propose a novel structured synthetic data framework designed for the controlled benchmarking of model robustness, fairness, and generalisability. Unlike approaches focused solely on mimicking observed data, our framework provides explicit control over the data generating process, including site-specific prevalence variations, hierarchical subgroup effects, and structured feature interactions. This enables targeted investigation into how models respond to specific distributional shifts and potential biases. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate the framework's ability to isolate the impact of site variations, support fairness-aware audits, and reveal generalisation failures, particularly highlighting how model complexity interacts with site-specific effects. This work contributes a reproducible, interpretable, and configurable tool designed to advance the reliable deployment of ML in clinical settings.

Abstract: Data-driven decision support tools play an increasingly central role in decision-making across various domains. In this work, we focus on binary classification models for predicting positive-outcome scores and deciding on resource allocation, e.g., credit scores for granting loans or churn propensity scores for targeting customers with a retention campaign. Such models may exhibit discriminatory behavior toward specific demographic groups through their predicted scores, potentially leading to unfair resource allocation. We focus on demographic parity as a fairness metric to compare the proportions of instances that are selected based on their positive outcome scores across groups. In this work, we propose a decision-centric fairness methodology that induces fairness only within the decision-making region -- the range of relevant decision thresholds on the score that may be used to decide on resource allocation -- as an alternative to a global fairness approach that seeks to enforce parity across the entire score distribution. By restricting the induction of fairness to the decision-making region, the proposed decision-centric approach avoids imposing overly restrictive constraints on the model, which may unnecessarily degrade the quality of the predicted scores. We empirically compare our approach to a global fairness approach on multiple (semi-synthetic) datasets to identify scenarios in which focusing on fairness where it truly matters, i.e., decision-centric fairness, proves beneficial.

<title>Combatting Dimensional Collapse in LLM Pre-Training Data via Diversified File Selection</title>

Abstract: Selecting high-quality pre-training data for large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their overall performance under limited computation budget, improving both training and sample efficiency. Recent advancements in file selection primarily rely on using an existing or trained proxy model to assess the similarity of samples to a target domain, such as high quality sources BookCorpus and Wikipedia. However, upon revisiting these methods, the domain-similarity selection criteria demonstrates a diversity dilemma, i.e.dimensional collapse in the feature space, improving performance on the domain-related tasks but causing severe degradation on generic performance. To prevent collapse and enhance diversity, we propose a DiverSified File selection algorithm (DiSF), which selects the most decorrelated text files in the feature space. We approach this with a classical greedy algorithm to achieve more uniform eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix of the selected texts, analyzing its approximation to the optimal solution under a formulation of $\gamma$-weakly submodular optimization problem. Empirically, we establish a benchmark and conduct extensive experiments on the TinyLlama architecture with models from 120M to 1.1B parameters. Evaluating across nine tasks from the Harness framework, DiSF demonstrates a significant improvement on overall performance. Specifically, DiSF saves 98.5% of 590M training files in SlimPajama, outperforming the full-data pre-training within a 50B training budget, and achieving about 1.5x training efficiency and 5x data efficiency.

Abstract: Rules offer an invaluable combination of predictive and descriptive capabilities. Our package for rule-based data analysis, RuleKit, has proven its effectiveness in classification, regression, and survival problems. Here we present its second version. New algorithms and optimized implementations of those previously included, significantly improved the computational performance of our suite, reducing the analysis time of some data sets by two orders of magnitude. The usability of RuleKit 2 is provided by two new components: Python package and browser application with a graphical user interface. The former complies with scikit-learn, the most popular data mining library for Python, allowing RuleKit 2 to be straightforwardly integrated into existing data analysis pipelines.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that allows multiple devices or institutions to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data with a third-party. FL is considered a promising way to address patient privacy concerns in medical artificial intelligence. The ethical risks of medical FL systems themselves, however, have thus far been underexamined. This paper aims to address this gap. We argue that medical FL presents a new variety of opacity -- federation opacity -- that, in turn, generates a distinctive double black box problem in healthcare AI. We highlight several instances in which the anticipated benefits of medical FL may be exaggerated, and conclude by highlighting key challenges that must be overcome to make FL ethically feasible in medicine.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel quantum classical hybrid framework is proposed that synergizes quantum with Classical Reinforcement Learning. By leveraging the inherent parallelism of quantum computing, the proposed approach generates robust Q tables and specialized turn cost estimations, which are then integrated with a classical Reinforcement Learning pipeline. The Classical Quantum fusion results in rapid convergence of training, reducing the training time significantly and improved adaptability in scenarios featuring static, dynamic, and moving obstacles. Simulator based evaluations demonstrate significant enhancements in path efficiency, trajectory smoothness, and mission success rates, underscoring the potential of framework for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework was tested beyond simulations on practical scenarios, including real world map data such as the IIT Delhi campus, reinforcing its potential for real time, autonomous navigation in complex and unpredictable environments.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional message-passing graph neural networks in many studies, especially in processing graph data with long-range dependencies. However, GTs tend to suffer from weak inductive bias, overfitting and over-globalizing problems due to the dense attention. In this paper, we introduce SFi-attention, a novel attention mechanism designed to learn sparse pattern by minimizing an energy function based on network flows with l1-norm regularization, to relieve those issues caused by dense attention. Furthermore, SFi-Former is accordingly devised which can leverage the sparse attention pattern of SFi-attention to generate sparse network flows beyond adjacency matrix of graph data. Specifically, SFi-Former aggregates features selectively from other nodes through flexible adaptation of the sparse attention, leading to a more robust model. We validate our SFi-Former on various graph datasets, especially those graph data exhibiting long-range dependencies. Experimental results show that our SFi-Former obtains competitive performance on GNN Benchmark datasets and SOTA performance on LongRange Graph Benchmark (LRGB) datasets. Additionally, our model gives rise to smaller generalization gaps, which indicates that it is less prone to over-fitting. Click here for codes.

<title>Explanations Go Linear: Interpretable and Individual Latent Encoding for Post-hoc Explainability</title>

Abstract: Post-hoc explainability is essential for understanding black-box machine learning models. Surrogate-based techniques are widely used for local and global model-agnostic explanations but have significant limitations. Local surrogates capture non-linearities but are computationally expensive and sensitive to parameters, while global surrogates are more efficient but struggle with complex local behaviors. In this paper, we present ILLUME, a flexible and interpretable framework grounded in representation learning, that can be integrated with various surrogate models to provide explanations for any black-box classifier. Specifically, our approach combines a globally trained surrogate with instance-specific linear transformations learned with a meta-encoder to generate both local and global explanations. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ILLUME in producing feature attributions and decision rules that are not only accurate but also robust and faithful to the black-box, thus providing a unified explanation framework that effectively addresses the limitations of traditional surrogate methods.

<title>What's Wrong with Your Synthetic Tabular Data? Using Explainable AI to Evaluate Generative Models</title>

Abstract: Evaluating synthetic tabular data is challenging, since they can differ from the real data in so many ways. There exist numerous metrics of synthetic data quality, ranging from statistical distances to predictive performance, often providing conflicting results. Moreover, they fail to explain or pinpoint the specific weaknesses in the synthetic data. To address this, we apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques to a binary detection classifier trained to distinguish real from synthetic data. While the classifier identifies distributional differences, XAI concepts such as feature importance and feature effects, analyzed through methods like permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, Shapley values and counterfactual explanations, reveal why synthetic data are distinguishable, highlighting inconsistencies, unrealistic dependencies, or missing patterns. This interpretability increases transparency in synthetic data evaluation and provides deeper insights beyond conventional metrics, helping diagnose and improve synthetic data quality. We apply our approach to two tabular datasets and generative models, showing that it uncovers issues overlooked by standard evaluation techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we study unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms that learn a neural network representation, i.e. regular patterns of normal data, which anomalies are deviating from. Inspired by a similar concept in engineering, we refer to our methodology as surrogate anomaly detection. We formalize the concept of surrogate anomaly detection into a set of axioms required for optimal surrogate models and propose a new algorithm, named DEAN (Deep Ensemble ANomaly detection), designed to fulfill these criteria. We evaluate DEAN on 121 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against 19 existing methods, as well as the scalability and reliability of our method.

Abstract: Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are integral to intelligent transportation systems, enabling vehicles to offload computational tasks to nearby roadside units (RSUs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) servers for real-time processing. However, the highly dynamic nature of VANETs introduces challenges, such as unpredictable network conditions, high latency, energy inefficiency, and task failure. This research addresses these issues by proposing a hybrid AI framework that integrates supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for intelligent task offloading and resource allocation. The framework leverages supervised models for predicting optimal offloading strategies, reinforcement learning for adaptive decision-making, and PSO for optimizing latency and energy consumption. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant reductions in latency and energy usage while improving task success rates and network throughput. By offering an efficient, and scalable solution, this framework sets the foundation for enhancing real-time applications in dynamic vehicular environments.

Abstract: Diffusion models form an important class of generative models today, accounting for much of the state of the art in cutting edge AI research. While numerous extensions beyond image and video generation exist, few of such approaches address the issue of explicit constraints in the samples generated. In this paper, we study the problem of generating paths in a layered graph (a variant of a directed acyclic graph) using discrete diffusion models, while guaranteeing that our generated samples are indeed paths. Our approach utilizes a simple yet effective representation for paths which we call the padded adjacency-list matrix (PALM). In addition, we show how to effectively perform classifier guidance, which helps steer the sampled paths to specific preferred edges without any retraining of the diffusion model. Our preliminary results show that empirically, our method outperforms alternatives which do not explicitly account for path constraints.

Abstract: The discovery of new molecules based on the original chemical molecule distributions is of great importance in medicine. The graph transformer, with its advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional graph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of graph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to effectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage only sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of molecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based framework for molecular generation, which we call \textbf{JTreeformer} as it transforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN parallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed acyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can iteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the partially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a diffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical results demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule generation methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).

Abstract: Identifying molecular properties, including side effects, is a critical yet time-consuming step in drug development. Failing to detect these side effects before regulatory submission can result in significant financial losses and production delays, and overlooking them during the regulatory review can lead to catastrophic consequences. This challenge presents an opportunity for innovative machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid quantum-classical models like the Quantum Kernel-Based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM) network. The QK-LSTM integrates quantum kernel functions into the classical LSTM framework, enabling the capture of complex, non-linear patterns in sequential data. By mapping input data into a high-dimensional quantum feature space, the QK-LSTM model reduces the need for large parameter sets, allowing for model compression without sacrificing accuracy in sequence-based tasks. Recent advancements have been made in the classical domain using augmented variations of the Simplified Molecular Line-Entry System (SMILES). However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has explored the impact of augmented SMILES in the quantum domain, nor the role of augmented Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) in either classical or hybrid quantum-classical settings. This study presents the first analysis of these approaches, providing novel insights into their potential for enhancing molecular property prediction and side effect identification. Results reveal that augmenting SELFIES yields in statistically significant improvements from SMILES by a 5.97% improvement for the classical domain and a 5.91% improvement for the hybrid quantum-classical domain.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds great potential for solving socially relevant and computationally complex problems. Furthermore, quantum machine learning (QML) promises to rapidly improve our current machine learning capabilities. However, current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are constrained by limitations in the number of qubits and gate counts, which hinder their full capabilities. Furthermore, the design of quantum algorithms remains a laborious task, requiring significant domain expertise and time. Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) aims to streamline this process by automatically generating novel quantum circuits, reducing the need for manual intervention. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based algorithm leveraging the LayerDAG framework to generate new quantum circuits. This method contrasts with other approaches that utilize large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), variational autoencoders (VAE), and similar techniques. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently generates 100% valid quantum circuit outputs.

<title>The When and How of Target Variable Transformations</title>

Abstract: The machine learning pipeline typically involves the iterative process of (1) collecting the data, (2) preparing the data, (3) learning a model, and (4) evaluating a model. Practitioners recognize the importance of the data preparation phase in terms of its impact on the ability to learn accurate models. In this regard, significant attention is often paid to manipulating the feature set (e.g., selection, transformations, dimensionality reduction). A point that is less well appreciated is that transformations on the target variable can also have a large impact on whether it is possible to learn a suitable model. These transformations may include accounting for subject-specific biases (e.g., in how someone uses a rating scale), contexts (e.g., population size effects), and general trends (e.g., inflation). However, this point has received a much more cursory treatment in the existing literature. The goal of this paper is three-fold. First, we aim to highlight the importance of this problem by showing when transforming the target variable has been useful in practice. Second, we will provide a set of generic ``rules of thumb'' that indicate situations when transforming the target variable may be needed. Third, we will discuss which transformations should be considered in a given situation.

Abstract: We present a novel method of classification and segmentation of melodies in symbolic representation. The method is based on filtering pitch as a signal over time with the Haar-wavelet, and we evaluate it on two tasks. The filtered signal corresponds to a single-scale signal ws from the continuous Haar wavelet transform. The melodies are first segmented using local maxima or zero-crossings of w_s. The segments of w_s are then classified using the k-nearest neighbour algorithm with Euclidian and city-block distances. The method proves more effective than using unfiltered pitch signals and Gestalt-based segmentation when used to recognize the parent works of segments from Bach's Two-Part Inventions (BWV 772-786). When used to classify 360 Dutch folk tunes into 26 tune families, the performance of the method is comparable to the use of pitch signals, but not as good as that of string-matching methods based on multiple features.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance in aerospace heavily relies on accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of jet engines. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network frame- work, combining Quantum Long Short-Term Memory layers with classical dense layers for Remaining Useful Life forecasting on NASA's Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation dataset. Each Quantum Long Short-Term Memory gate replaces conventional linear transformations with Quantum Depth-Infused circuits, allowing the network to learn high-frequency components more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum Recurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent Neural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough comparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our approach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these baselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively. Nevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures. Our findings highlight the poten- tial of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for robust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new avenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks.

Abstract: We explore reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance reasoning within targeted problem spaces in large language models (LLMs) under memory and compute constraints. Our focus is on critic-free methods compatible with LoRA fine-tuning on a single 40GB GPU, a common limitation in academic settings. We introduce S-GRPO, a memory-efficient variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching strategy for fine-grained credit assignment. Despite limited resources, when used to fine-tune Qwen2-1.5B both methods significantly improve SVAMP benchmark accuracy from 46% to above 70% using LoRA training. T-SPMO also excels in multi-digit multiplication tasks, underscoring the potential of RL fine-tuning under hardware constraints. Additionally, we find that our full-token GRPO baseline under LoRA fine-tuning did not improve model performance (compared to base model) on either task, suggesting that our memory-efficient methods may act as a form of regularization that stabilizes training when only a small subset of parameters are updated.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in addressing various graph structure-related downstream tasks. However, recent studies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial attacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real world, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks and enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of these defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural bias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail nodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes with low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a defense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN augmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to mitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the hetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic links (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low degree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is adopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of graph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and debiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Learning approaches is often based and demonstrated on large public datasets. However, when applying such approaches to internal, private datasets, one frequently faces challenges arising from structural differences in the datasets, domain shift, and the lack of labels. In this work, we introduce Tabular Data Adapters (TDA), a novel method for generating soft labels for unlabeled tabular data in outlier detection tasks. By identifying statistically similar public datasets and transforming private data (based on a shared autoencoder) into a format compatible with state-of-the-art public models, our approach enables the generation of weak labels. It thereby can help to mitigate the cold start problem of labeling by basing on existing outlier detection models for public datasets. In experiments on 50 tabular datasets across different domains, we demonstrate that our method is able to provide more accurate annotations than baseline approaches while reducing computational time. Our approach offers a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution, to bridge the gap between public research models and real-world industrial applications.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have been widely utilized to solve graph-related tasks because of their strong learning power in utilizing the local information of neighbors. However, recent studies on graph adversarial attacks have proven that current graph neural networks are not robust against malicious attacks. Yet much of the existing work has focused on the optimization objective based on attack performance to obtain (near) optimal perturbations, but paid less attention to the strength quantification of each perturbation such as the injection of a particular node/link, which makes the choice of perturbations a black-box model that lacks interpretability. In this work, we propose the concept of noise to quantify the attack strength of each adversarial link. Furthermore, we propose three attack strategies based on the defined noise and classification margins in terms of single and multiple steps optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets against three representative graph neural networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack strategies. Particularly, we also investigate the preferred patterns of effective adversarial perturbations by analyzing the corresponding properties of the selected perturbation nodes.

Abstract: When optimising for conditional value at risk (CVaR) using policy gradients (PG), current meth- ods rely on discarding a large proportion of tra- jectories, resulting in poor sample efficiency. We propose a reformulation of the CVaR optimisation problem by capping the total return of trajecto- ries used in training, rather than simply discard- ing them, and show that this is equivalent to the original problem if the cap is set appropriately. We show, with empirical results in an number of environments, that this reformulation of the prob- lem results in consistently improved performance compared to baselines.

<title>Does Feedback Help in Bandits with Arm Erasures?</title>

Abstract: We study a distributed multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem over arm erasure channels, motivated by the increasing adoption of MAB algorithms over communication-constrained networks. In this setup, the learner communicates the chosen arm to play to an agent over an erasure channel with probability $\epsilon \in [0,1)$; if an erasure occurs, the agent continues pulling the last successfully received arm; the learner always observes the reward of the arm pulled. In past work, we considered the case where the agent cannot convey feedback to the learner, and thus the learner does not know whether the arm played is the requested or the last successfully received one. In this paper, we instead consider the case where the agent can send feedback to the learner on whether the arm request was received, and thus the learner exactly knows which arm was played. Surprisingly, we prove that erasure feedback does not improve the worst-case regret upper bound order over the previously studied no-feedback setting. In particular, we prove a regret lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT} + K / (1 - \epsilon))$, where $K$ is the number of arms and $T$ the time horizon, that matches no-feedback upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. We note however that the availability of feedback enables simpler algorithm designs that may achieve better constants (albeit not better order) regret bounds; we design one such algorithm and evaluate its performance numerically.

<title>Evaluating Generative Models for Tabular Data: Novel Metrics and Benchmarking</title>

Abstract: Generative models have revolutionized multiple domains, yet their application to tabular data remains underexplored. Evaluating generative models for tabular data presents unique challenges due to structural complexity, large-scale variability, and mixed data types, making it difficult to intuitively capture intricate patterns. Existing evaluation metrics offer only partial insights, lacking a comprehensive measure of generative performance. To address this limitation, we propose three novel evaluation metrics: FAED, FPCAD, and RFIS. Our extensive experimental analysis, conducted on three standard network intrusion detection datasets, compares these metrics with established evaluation methods such as Fidelity, Utility, TSTR, and TRTS. Our results demonstrate that FAED effectively captures generative modeling issues overlooked by existing metrics. While FPCAD exhibits promising performance, further refinements are necessary to enhance its reliability. Our proposed framework provides a robust and practical approach for assessing generative models in tabular data applications.

<title>MOSIC: Model-Agnostic Optimal Subgroup Identification with Multi-Constraint for Improved Reliability</title>

Abstract: Identifying subgroups that benefit from specific treatments using observational data is a critical challenge in personalized medicine. Most existing approaches solely focus on identifying a subgroup with an improved treatment effect. However, practical considerations, such as ensuring a minimum subgroup size for representativeness or achieving sufficient confounder balance for reliability, are also important for making findings clinically meaningful and actionable. While some studies address these constraints individually, none offer a unified approach to handle them simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose a model-agnostic framework for optimal subgroup identification under multiple constraints. We reformulate this combinatorial problem as an unconstrained min-max optimization problem with novel modifications and solve it by a gradient descent ascent algorithm. We further prove its convergence to a feasible and locally optimal solution. Our method is stable and highly flexible, supporting various models and techniques for estimating and optimizing treatment effectiveness with observational data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying subgroups that satisfy multiple constraints, achieving higher treatment effects and better confounder balancing results across different group sizes.

<title>Statistical and Predictive Analysis to Identify Risk Factors and Effects of Post COVID-19 Syndrome</title>

Abstract: Based on recent studies, some COVID-19 symptoms can persist for months after infection, leading to what is termed long COVID. Factors such as vaccination timing, patient characteristics, and symptoms during the acute phase of infection may contribute to the prolonged effects and intensity of long COVID. Each patient, based on their unique combination of factors, develops a specific risk or intensity of long COVID. In this work, we aim to achieve two objectives: (1) conduct a statistical analysis to identify relationships between various factors and long COVID, and (2) perform predictive analysis of long COVID intensity using these factors. We benchmark and interpret various data-driven approaches, including linear models, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks, using data from the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort. Our results show that Neural Networks (NN) achieve the best performance in terms of MAPE, with predictions averaging 19\% error. Additionally, interpretability analysis reveals key factors such as loss of smell, headache, muscle pain, and vaccination timing as significant predictors, while chronic disease and gender are critical risk factors. These insights provide valuable guidance for understanding long COVID and developing targeted interventions.

<title>Improvements of Dark Experience Replay and Reservoir Sampling towards Better Balance between Consolidation and Plasticity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20932</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual learning is the one of the most essential abilities for autonomous agents, which can incrementally learn daily-life skills. For this ultimate goal, a simple but powerful method, dark experience replay (DER), has been proposed recently. DER mitigates catastrophic forgetting, in which the skills acquired in the past are unintentionally forgotten, by stochastically storing the streaming data in a reservoir sampling (RS) buffer and by relearning them or retaining the past outputs for them. However, since DER considers multiple objectives, it will not function properly without appropriate weighting of them. In addition, the ability to retain past outputs inhibits learning if the past outputs are incorrect due to distribution shift or other effects. This is due to a tradeoff between memory consolidation and plasticity. The tradeoff is hidden even in the RS buffer, which gradually stops storing new data for new skills in it as data is continuously passed to it. To alleviate the tradeoff and achieve better balance, this paper proposes improvement strategies to each of DER and RS. Specifically, DER is improved with automatic adaptation of weights, block of replaying erroneous data, and correction of past outputs. RS is also improved with generalization of acceptance probability, stratification of plural buffers, and intentional omission of unnecessary data. These improvements are verified through multiple benchmarks including regression, classification, and reinforcement learning problems. As a result, the proposed methods achieve steady improvements in learning performance by balancing the memory consolidation and plasticity.

<title>Towards Understanding the Nature of Attention with Low-Rank Sparse Decomposition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Low-Rank Sparse Attention (Lorsa), a sparse replacement model of Transformer attention layers to disentangle original Multi Head Self Attention (MHSA) into individually comprehensible components. Lorsa is designed to address the challenge of attention superposition to understand attention-mediated interaction between features in different token positions. We show that Lorsa heads find cleaner and finer-grained versions of previously discovered MHSA behaviors like induction heads, successor heads and attention sink behavior (i.e., heavily attending to the first token). Lorsa and Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) are both sparse dictionary learning methods applied to different Transformer components, and lead to consistent findings in many ways. For instance, we discover a comprehensive family of arithmetic-specific Lorsa heads, each corresponding to an atomic operation in Llama-3.1-8B. Automated interpretability analysis indicates that Lorsa achieves parity with SAE in interpretability while Lorsa exhibits superior circuit discovery properties, especially for features computed collectively by multiple MHSA heads. We also conduct extensive experiments on architectural design ablation, Lorsa scaling law and error analysis.

<title>Scenario-based Compositional Verification of Autonomous Systems with Neural Perception</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the development of autonomous systems that use deep neural networks for perception. Formal verification of these systems is challenging due to the size and complexity of the perception DNNs as well as hard-to-quantify, changing environment conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic verification framework for autonomous systems based on the following key concepts: (1) Scenario-based Modeling: We decompose the task (e.g., car navigation) into a composition of scenarios, each representing a different environment condition. (2) Probabilistic Abstractions: For each scenario, we build a compact abstraction of perception based on the DNN's performance on an offline dataset that represents the scenario's environment condition. (3) Symbolic Reasoning and Acceleration: The abstractions enable efficient compositional verification of the autonomous system via symbolic reasoning and a novel acceleration proof rule that bounds the error probability of the system under arbitrary variations of environment conditions. We illustrate our approach on two case studies: an experimental autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional perception DNNs and a simulation model of an F1Tenth autonomous car using LiDAR observations.

<title>Deep Learning Characterizes Depression and Suicidal Ideation from Eye Movements</title>

Abstract: Identifying physiological and behavioral markers for mental health conditions is a longstanding challenge in psychiatry. Depression and suicidal ideation, in particular, lack objective biomarkers, with screening and diagnosis primarily relying on self-reports and clinical interviews. Here, we investigate eye tracking as a potential marker modality for screening purposes. Eye movements are directly modulated by neuronal networks and have been associated with attentional and mood-related patterns; however, their predictive value for depression and suicidality remains unclear. We recorded eye-tracking sequences from 126 young adults as they read and responded to affective sentences, and subsequently developed a deep learning framework to predict their clinical status. The proposed model included separate branches for trials of positive and negative sentiment, and used 2D time-series representations to account for both intra-trial and inter-trial variations. We were able to identify depression and suicidal ideation with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.793 (95% CI: 0.765-0.819) against healthy controls, and suicidality specifically with 0.826 AUC (95% CI: 0.797-0.852). The model also exhibited moderate, yet significant, accuracy in differentiating depressed from suicidal participants, with 0.609 AUC (95% CI 0.571-0.646). Discriminative patterns emerge more strongly when assessing the data relative to response generation than relative to the onset time of the final word of the sentences. The most pronounced effects were observed for negative-sentiment sentences, that are congruent to depressed and suicidal participants. Our findings highlight eye tracking as an objective tool for mental health assessment and underscore the modulatory impact of emotional stimuli on cognitive processes affecting oculomotor control.

<title>AegisLLM: Scaling Agentic Systems for Self-Reflective Defense in LLM Security</title>

arXiv:2504.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AegisLLM, a cooperative multi-agent defense against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In AegisLLM, a structured workflow of autonomous agents - orchestrator, deflector, responder, and evaluator - collaborate to ensure safe and compliant LLM outputs, while self-improving over time through prompt optimization. We show that scaling agentic reasoning system at test-time - both by incorporating additional agent roles and by leveraging automated prompt optimization (such as DSPy)- substantially enhances robustness without compromising model utility. This test-time defense enables real-time adaptability to evolving attacks, without requiring model retraining. Comprehensive evaluations across key threat scenarios, including unlearning and jailbreaking, demonstrate the effectiveness of AegisLLM. On the WMDP unlearning benchmark, AegisLLM achieves near-perfect unlearning with only 20 training examples and fewer than 300 LM calls. For jailbreaking benchmarks, we achieve 51% improvement compared to the base model on StrongReject, with false refusal rates of only 7.9% on PHTest compared to 18-55% for comparable methods. Our results highlight the advantages of adaptive, agentic reasoning over static defenses, establishing AegisLLM as a strong runtime alternative to traditional approaches based on model modifications.

arXiv:2504.20966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce softpick, a rectified, not sum-to-one, drop-in replacement for softmax in transformer attention mechanisms that eliminates attention sink and massive activations. Our experiments with 340M parameter models demonstrate that softpick maintains performance parity with softmax on standard benchmarks while achieving 0% sink rate. The softpick transformer produces hidden states with significantly lower kurtosis (340 vs 33,510) and creates sparse attention maps (46.97% sparsity). Models using softpick consistently outperform softmax when quantized, with particularly pronounced advantages at lower bit precisions. Our analysis and discussion shows how softpick has the potential to open new possibilities for quantization, low-precision training, sparsity optimization, pruning, and interpretability. Our code is available at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/softpick-attention.

<title>Equivariant non-linear maps for neural networks on homogeneous spaces</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for non-linear equivariant neural network layers on homogeneous spaces. The seminal work of Cohen et al. on equivariant $G$-CNNs on homogeneous spaces characterized the representation theory of such layers in the linear setting, finding that they are given by convolutions with kernels satisfying so-called steerability constraints. Motivated by the empirical success of non-linear layers, such as self-attention or input dependent kernels, we set out to generalize these insights to the non-linear setting. We derive generalized steerability constraints that any such layer needs to satisfy and prove the universality of our construction. The insights gained into the symmetry-constrained functional dependence of equivariant operators on feature maps and group elements informs the design of future equivariant neural network layers. We demonstrate how several common equivariant network architectures - $G$-CNNs, implicit steerable kernel networks, conventional and relative position embedded attention based transformers, and LieTransformers - may be derived from our framework.

arXiv:2504.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Hubs and Spokes Learning (HSL) framework, a novel paradigm for collaborative machine learning that combines the strengths of Federated Learning (FL) and Decentralized Learning (P2PL). HSL employs a two-tier communication structure that avoids the single point of failure inherent in FL and outperforms the state-of-the-art P2PL framework, Epidemic Learning Local (ELL). At equal communication budgets (total edges), HSL achieves higher performance than ELL, while at significantly lower communication budgets, it can match ELL's performance. For instance, with only 400 edges, HSL reaches the same test accuracy that ELL achieves with 1000 edges for 100 peers (spokes) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating its suitability for resource-constrained systems. HSL also achieves stronger consensus among nodes after mixing, resulting in improved performance with fewer training rounds. We substantiate these claims through rigorous theoretical analyses and extensive experimental results, showcasing HSL's practicality for large-scale collaborative learning.

arXiv:2504.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A burgeoning area within reinforcement learning (RL) is the design of sequential decision-making agents centered around large language models (LLMs). While autonomous decision-making agents powered by modern LLMs could facilitate numerous real-world applications, such successes demand agents that are capable of data-efficient RL. One key obstacle to achieving data efficiency in RL is exploration, a challenge that we demonstrate many recent proposals for LLM agent designs struggle to contend with. Meanwhile, classic algorithms from the RL literature known to gracefully address exploration require technical machinery that can be challenging to operationalize in purely natural language settings. In this work, rather than relying on finetuning or in-context learning to coax LLMs into implicitly imitating a RL algorithm, we illustrate how LLMs can be used to explicitly implement an existing RL algorithm (Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning) whose capacity for statistically-efficient exploration is already well-studied. We offer empirical results demonstrating how our LLM-based implementation of a known, data-efficient RL algorithm can be considerably more effective in natural language tasks that demand prudent exploration.

Abstract: Fluctuations in stock prices are influenced by a complex interplay of factors that go beyond mere historical data. These factors, themselves influenced by external forces, encompass inter-stock dynamics, broader economic factors, various government policy decisions, outbreaks of wars, etc. Furthermore, all of these factors are dynamic and exhibit changes over time. In this paper, for the first time, we tackle the forecasting problem under external influence by proposing learning mechanisms that not only learn from historical trends but also incorporate external knowledge from temporal knowledge graphs. Since there are no such datasets or temporal knowledge graphs available, we study this problem with stock market data, and we construct comprehensive temporal knowledge graph datasets. In our proposed approach, we model relations on external temporal knowledge graphs as events of a Hawkes process on graphs. With extensive experiments, we show that learned dynamic representations effectively rank stocks based on returns across multiple holding periods, outperforming related baselines on relevant metrics.

<title>Tempo: Application-aware LLM Serving with Mixed SLO Requirements</title>

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into diverse applications, ranging from interactive chatbots and cloud AIOps to intelligent agents, has introduced a wide spectrum of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for responsiveness. These workloads include latency-sensitive requests focused on per-token latency in streaming chat, throughput-intensive requests that require rapid full responses to invoke tools, and collective requests with dynamic dependencies arising from self-reflection or agent-based reasoning. This workload diversity, amplified by unpredictable request information such as response lengths and runtime dependencies, makes existing schedulers inadequate even within their design envelopes.
  In this paper, we define service gain as the useful service delivered by completing requests. We observe that as SLO directly reflects the actual performance needs of requests, completing a request much faster than its SLO (e.g., deadline) yields limited additional service gain. Based on this insight, we introduce Tempo, the first systematic SLO-aware scheduler designed to maximize service gain across diverse LLM workloads. Tempo allocates just enough serving bandwidth to meet each SLO, maximizing residual capacity for others best-effort workloads. Instead of assuming request information or none at all, it adopts a hybrid scheduling strategy: using quantile-based response upper bounds and dependency-graph matching for conservative initial estimates, prioritizing requests by service gain density, and refining decisions online as generation progresses. Our evaluation across diverse workloads, including chat, reasoning, and agentic pipelines, shows that Tempo improves end-to-end service gain by up to 8.3$\times$ and achieves up to 10.3$\times$ SLO goodput compared to state-of-the-art designs

Abstract: The increasing adoption of approximate computing in deep neural network accelerators (AxDNNs) promises significant energy efficiency gains. However, permanent faults in AxDNNs can severely degrade their performance compared to their accurate counterparts (AccDNNs). Traditional fault detection and mitigation approaches, while effective for AccDNNs, introduce substantial overhead and latency, making them impractical for energy-constrained real-time deployment. To address this, we introduce EPSILON, a lightweight framework that leverages pre-computed statistical signatures and layer-wise importance metrics for efficient fault detection and mitigation in AxDNNs. Our framework introduces a novel non-parametric pattern-matching algorithm that enables constant-time fault detection without interrupting normal execution while dynamically adapting to different network architectures and fault patterns. EPSILON maintains model accuracy by intelligently adjusting mitigation strategies based on a statistical analysis of weight distribution and layer criticality while preserving the energy benefits of approximate computing. Extensive evaluations across various approximate multipliers, AxDNN architectures, popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k), and fault scenarios demonstrate that EPSILON maintains 80.05\% accuracy while offering 22\% improvement in inference time and 28\% improvement in energy efficiency, establishing EPSILON as a practical solution for deploying reliable AxDNNs in safety-critical edge applications.

Abstract: To responsibly develop Generative AI (GenAI) products, it is critical to define the scope of acceptable inputs and outputs. What constitutes a "safe" response is an actively debated question. Academic work puts an outsized focus on evaluating models by themselves for general purpose aspects such as toxicity, bias, and fairness, especially in conversational applications being used by a broad audience. In contrast, less focus is put on considering sociotechnical systems in specialized domains. Yet, those specialized systems can be subject to extensive and well-understood legal and regulatory scrutiny. These product-specific considerations need to be set in industry-specific laws, regulations, and corporate governance requirements. In this paper, we aim to highlight AI content safety considerations specific to the financial services domain and outline an associated AI content risk taxonomy. We compare this taxonomy to existing work in this space and discuss implications of risk category violations on various stakeholders. We evaluate how existing open-source technical guardrail solutions cover this taxonomy by assessing them on data collected via red-teaming activities. Our results demonstrate that these guardrails fail to detect most of the content risks we discuss.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of deep residual networks for pricing European options on Petrobras, one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and compares its performance with the Black-Scholes (BS) model. Using eight years of historical data from B3 (Brazilian Stock Exchange) collected via web scraping, a deep learning model was trained using a custom built hybrid loss function that incorporates market data and analytical pricing. The data for training and testing were drawn between the period spanning November 2016 to January 2025, using an 80-20 train-test split. The test set consisted of data from the final three months: November, December, and January 2025. The deep residual network model achieved a 64.3\% reduction in the mean absolute error for the 3-19 BRL (Brazilian Real) range when compared to the Black-Scholes model on the test set. Furthermore, unlike the Black-Scholes solution, which tends to decrease its accuracy for longer periods of time, the deep learning model performed accurately for longer expiration periods. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning in financial modeling, with future work focusing on specialized models for different price ranges.

Our work is both a system demonstration and intended to inspire other CC researchers to explore grounding the generation and evaluation of scientific ideas within foundational CC principles. To this end, we release the annotated dataset used to train Judge, inviting other researchers to explore the use of LLMs for idea generation and creative evaluations.

Abstract: Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a core task in drug development and precision medicine in the biomedical field. However, traditional machine learning methods generally have the black box problem, which makes it difficult to reveal the deep correlation between the model decision mechanism and the interaction pattern between biological molecules. This study proposes a heterogeneous network drug target interaction prediction framework, integrating graph neural network and multi scale signal processing technology to construct a model with both efficient prediction and multi level interpretability. Its technical breakthroughs are mainly reflected in the following three dimensions:Local global feature collaborative perception module. Based on heterogeneous graph convolutional neural network (HGCN), a multi order neighbor aggregation strategy is designed.Multi scale graph signal decomposition and biological interpretation module. A deep hierarchical node feature transform (GWT) architecture is proposed.Contrastive learning combining multi dimensional perspectives and hierarchical representations. By comparing the learning models, the node representations from the two perspectives of HGCN and GWT are aligned and fused, so that the model can integrate multi dimensional information and improve the prediction robustness. Experimental results show that our framework shows excellent prediction performance on all datasets. This study provides a complete solution for drug target discovery from black box prediction to mechanism decoding, and its methodology has important reference value for modeling complex biomolecular interaction systems.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has made remarkable advancements in recent years, primarily driven by increasingly large deep learning models. However, achieving true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new architectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches largely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific performance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized learning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on resource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge.
  This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired AI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates brain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on continuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss key neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning, Hebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for AI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that features complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic self-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device lifelong adaptation.
  Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are provided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory efficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for mobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots. We conclude with key takeaways and future research directions toward truly continual, personalized AGI on the edge. While the architecture is theoretical, it synthesizes diverse findings and offers a roadmap for future implementation.

Abstract: Exponential growth in scientific literature has heightened the demand for efficient evidence-based synthesis, driving the rise of the field of Automated Meta-analysis (AMA) powered by natural language processing and machine learning. This PRISMA systematic review introduces a structured framework for assessing the current state of AMA, based on screening 978 papers from 2006 to 2024, and analyzing 54 studies across diverse domains. Findings reveal a predominant focus on automating data processing (57%), such as extraction and statistical modeling, while only 17% address advanced synthesis stages. Just one study (2%) explored preliminary full-process automation, highlighting a critical gap that limits AMA's capacity for comprehensive synthesis. Despite recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and advanced AI, their integration into statistical modeling and higher-order synthesis, such as heterogeneity assessment and bias evaluation, remains underdeveloped. This has constrained AMA's potential for fully autonomous meta-analysis. From our dataset spanning medical (67%) and non-medical (33%) applications, we found that AMA has exhibited distinct implementation patterns and varying degrees of effectiveness in actually improving efficiency, scalability, and reproducibility. While automation has enhanced specific meta-analytic tasks, achieving seamless, end-to-end automation remains an open challenge. As AI systems advance in reasoning and contextual understanding, addressing these gaps is now imperative. Future efforts must focus on bridging automation across all meta-analysis stages, refining interpretability, and ensuring methodological robustness to fully realize AMA's potential for scalable, domain-agnostic synthesis.

<title>TreeHop: Generate and Filter Next Query Embeddings Efficiently for Multi-hop Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20114</link>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where complex queries require synthesizing information across multiple document chunks. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative LLM-based query rewriting and routing, resulting in high computational costs due to repeated LLM invocations and multi-stage processes. To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional "Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve" cycle with a streamlined "Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate. Experimental results show that TreeHop rivals advanced RAG methods across three open-domain MHQA datasets, achieving comparable performance with only 5\%-0.4\% of the model parameter size and reducing the query latency by approximately 99\% compared to concurrent approaches. This makes TreeHop a faster and more cost-effective solution for deployment in a range of knowledge-intensive applications. For reproducibility purposes, codes and data are available here: https://github.com/allen-li1231/TreeHop.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models offer significant potential for advancing cell counting applications in neuroscience, medical research, pharmaceutical development, and environmental monitoring. However, implementing these models effectively requires robust operational frameworks. This paper introduces Cell Counting Machine Learning Operations (CC-MLOps), a comprehensive framework that streamlines the integration of ML in cell counting workflows. CC-MLOps encompasses data access and preprocessing, model training, monitoring, explainability features, and sustainability considerations. Through a practical use case, we demonstrate how MLOps principles can enhance model reliability, reduce human error, and enable scalable Cell Counting solutions. This work provides actionable guidance for researchers and laboratory professionals seeking to implement machine learning (ML)- powered cell counting systems.

<title>Learning Hierarchical Interaction for Accurate Molecular Property Prediction</title>

Abstract: Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches typically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse chemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture and utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and lack mechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing Mechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, HimNet. Our method enables interaction-aware representation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via hierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to effectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and task-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such as Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property prediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical interpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative molecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for molecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing significantly to advanced decision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.

<title>A Physically Driven Long Short Term Memory Model for Estimating Snow Water Equivalent over the Continental United States</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20129</link>

Abstract: Snow is an essential input for various land surface models. Seasonal snow estimates are available as snow water equivalent (SWE) from process-based reanalysis products or locally from in situ measurements. While the reanalysis products are computationally expensive and available at only fixed spatial and temporal resolutions, the in situ measurements are highly localized and sparse. To address these issues and enable the analysis of the effect of a large suite of physical, morphological, and geological conditions on the presence and amount of snow, we build a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is able to estimate the SWE based on time series input of the various physical/meteorological factors as well static spatial/morphological factors. Specifically, this model breaks down the SWE estimation into two separate tasks: (i) a classification task that indicates the presence/absence of snow on a specific day and (ii) a regression task that indicates the height of the SWE on a specific day in the case of snow presence. The model is trained using physical/in situ SWE measurements from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) snow pillows in the western United States. We will show that trained LSTM models have a classification accuracy of $\geq 93\%$ for the presence of snow and a coefficient of correlation of $\sim 0.9$ concerning their SWE estimates. We will also demonstrate that the models can generalize both spatially and temporally to previously unseen data.

<title>MICE for CATs: Model-Internal Confidence Estimation for Calibrating Agents with Tools</title>

Abstract: Tool-using agents that act in the world need to be both useful and safe. Well-calibrated model confidences can be used to weigh the risk versus reward of potential actions, but prior work shows that many models are poorly calibrated. Inspired by interpretability literature exploring the internals of models, we propose a novel class of model-internal confidence estimators (MICE) to better assess confidence when calling tools. MICE first decodes from each intermediate layer of the language model using logitLens and then computes similarity scores between each layer's generation and the final output. These features are fed into a learned probabilistic classifier to assess confidence in the decoded output. On the simulated trial and error (STE) tool-calling dataset using Llama3 models, we find that MICE beats or matches the baselines on smoothed expected calibration error. Using MICE confidences to determine whether to call a tool significantly improves over strong baselines on a new metric, expected tool-calling utility. Further experiments show that MICE is sample-efficient, can generalize zero-shot to unseen APIs, and results in higher tool-calling utility in scenarios with varying risk levels. Our code is open source, available at https://github.com/microsoft/mice_for_cats.

<title>A Transformer-based Multimodal Fusion Model for Efficient Crowd Counting Using Visual and Wireless Signals</title>

Abstract: Current crowd-counting models often rely on single-modal inputs, such as visual images or wireless signal data, which can result in significant information loss and suboptimal recognition performance. To address these shortcomings, we propose TransFusion, a novel multimodal fusion-based crowd- counting model that integrates Channel State Information (CSI) with image data. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Transformer networks, TransFusion effectively combines these two distinct data modalities, enabling the capture of comprehen- sive global contextual information that is critical for accurate crowd estimation. However, while transformers are well capable of capturing global features, they potentially fail to identify finer- grained, local details essential for precise crowd counting. To mitigate this, we incorporate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into the model architecture, enhancing its ability to extract detailed local features that complement the global context provided by the Transformer. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that TransFusion achieves high accuracy with minimal counting errors while maintaining superior efficiency.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equation (ODE) based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for producing high-quality samples in many applications. However, the ODE-based methods either suffer the discretization error of numerical solvers of ODE, which restricts the quality of samples when only a few NFEs are used, or struggle with training instability. In this paper, we proposed Integration Flow, which directly learns the integral of ODE-based trajectory paths without solving the ODE functions. Moreover, Integration Flow explicitly incorporates the target state $\mathbf{x}_0$ as the anchor state in guiding the reverse-time dynamics. We have theoretically proven this can contribute to both stability and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, Integration Flow is the first model with a unified structure to estimate ODE-based generative models and the first to show the exact straightness of 1-Rectified Flow without reflow. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we show that Integration Flows achieve improved performance when it is applied to existing ODE-based models, such as diffusion models, Rectified Flows, and PFGM++. Specifically, Integration Flow achieves one-step generation on CIFAR10 with FIDs of 2.86 for the Variance Exploding (VE) diffusion model, 3.36 for rectified flow without reflow, and 2.91 for PFGM++; and on ImageNet with FIDs of 4.09 for VE diffusion model, 4.35 for rectified flow without reflow and 4.15 for PFGM++.

Abstract: We introduce CO2, an efficient algorithm to produce convexly-weighted coresets with respect to generic smooth divergences. By employing a functional Taylor expansion, we show a local equivalence between sufficiently regular losses and their second order approximations, reducing the coreset selection problem to maximum mean discrepancy minimization. We apply CO2 to the Sinkhorn divergence, providing a novel sampling procedure that requires logarithmically many data points to match the approximation guarantees of random sampling. To show this, we additionally verify several new regularity properties for entropically regularized optimal transport of independent interest. Our approach leads to a new perspective linking coreset selection and kernel quadrature to classical statistical methods such as moment and score matching. We showcase this method with a practical application of subsampling image data, and highlight key directions to explore for improved algorithmic efficiency and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive evaluation of neural network graph compilers across heterogeneous hardware platforms, addressing the critical gap between theoretical optimization techniques and practical deployment scenarios. We demonstrate how vendor-specific optimizations can invalidate relative performance comparisons between architectural archetypes, with performance advantages sometimes completely reversing after compilation. Our systematic analysis reveals that graph compilers exhibit performance patterns highly dependent on both neural architecture and batch sizes. Through fine-grained block-level experimentation, we establish that vendor-specific compilers can leverage repeated patterns in simple architectures, yielding disproportionate throughput gains as model depth increases. We introduce novel metrics to quantify a compiler's ability to mitigate performance friction as batch size increases. Our methodology bridges the gap between academic research and practical deployment by incorporating compiler effects throughout the research process, providing actionable insights for practitioners navigating complex optimization landscapes across heterogeneous hardware environments.

Abstract: Atmospheric predictability research has long held that the limit of skillful deterministic weather forecasts is about 14 days. We challenge this limit using GraphCast, a machine-learning weather model, by optimizing forecast initial conditions using gradient-based techniques for twice-daily forecasts spanning 2020. This approach yields an average error reduction of 86% at 10 days, with skill lasting beyond 30 days. Mean optimal initial-condition perturbations reveal large-scale, spatially coherent corrections to ERA5, primarily reflecting an intensification of the Hadley circulation. Forecasts using GraphCast-optimal initial conditions in the Pangu-Weather model achieve a 21% error reduction, peaking at 4 days, indicating that analysis corrections reflect a combination of both model bias and a reduction in analysis error. These results demonstrate that, given accurate initial conditions, skillful deterministic forecasts are consistently achievable far beyond two weeks, challenging long-standing assumptions about the limits of atmospheric predictability.

Abstract: Many model selection algorithms rely on sparse dictionary learning to provide interpretable and physics-based governing equations. The optimization algorithms typically use a hard thresholding process to enforce sparse activations in the model coefficients by removing library elements from consideration. By introducing an annealing scheme that reactivates a fraction of the removed terms with a cooling schedule, we are able to improve the performance of these sparse learning algorithms. We concentrate on two approaches to the optimization, SINDy, and an alternative using hard thresholding pursuit. We see in both cases that annealing can improve model accuracy. The effectiveness of annealing is demonstrated through comparisons on several nonlinear systems pulled from convective flows, excitable systems, and population dynamics. Finally we apply these algorithms to experimental data for projectile motion.

Abstract: Digital twins (DTs) help improve real-time monitoring and decision-making in water distribution systems. However, their connectivity makes them easy targets for cyberattacks such as scanning, denial-of-service (DoS), and unauthorized access. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that manage these systems often do not have enough budget or staff to build strong cybersecurity teams. To solve this problem, we present a Virtual Cybersecurity Department (VCD), an affordable and automated framework designed for SMEs. The VCD uses open-source tools like Zabbix for real-time monitoring, Suricata for network intrusion detection, Fail2Ban to block repeated login attempts, and simple firewall settings. To improve threat detection, we also add a machine-learning-based IDS trained on the OD-IDS2022 dataset using an improved ensemble model. This model detects cyber threats such as brute-force attacks, remote code execution (RCE), and network flooding, with 92\% accuracy and fewer false alarms. Our solution gives SMEs a practical and efficient way to secure water systems using low-cost and easy-to-manage tools.

Abstract: Water distribution systems in rural areas face serious challenges such as a lack of real-time monitoring, vulnerability to cyberattacks, and unreliable data handling. This paper presents an integrated framework that combines LoRaWAN-based data acquisition, a machine learning-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and a blockchain-enabled Digital Twin (BC-DT) platform for secure and transparent water management. The IDS filters anomalous or spoofed data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder and Isolation Forest before validated data is logged via smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus. The verified data feeds into a real-time DT model supporting leak detection, consumption forecasting, and predictive maintenance. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves over 80 transactions per second (TPS) with under 2 seconds of latency while remaining cost-effective and scalable for up to 1,000 smart meters. This work demonstrates a practical and secure architecture for decentralized water infrastructure in under-connected rural environments.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification aims to recognize objects belonging to multiple subordinate categories within a super-category. However, this remains a challenging problem, as appearance information alone is often insufficient to accurately differentiate between fine-grained visual categories. To address this, we propose a novel and unified framework that leverages meta-information to assist fine-grained identification. We tackle the joint learning of visual and meta-information through cross-contrastive pre-training. In the first stage, we employ three encoders for images, text, and meta-information, aligning their projected embeddings to achieve better representations. We then fine-tune the image and meta-information encoders for the classification task. Experiments on the NABirds dataset demonstrate that our framework effectively utilizes meta-information to enhance fine-grained recognition performance. With the addition of meta-information, our framework surpasses the current baseline on NABirds by 7.83%. Furthermore, it achieves an accuracy of 84.44% on the NABirds dataset, outperforming many existing state-of-the-art approaches that utilize meta-information.

Abstract: This report addresses the challenge of limited labeled datasets for developing legal recommender systems, particularly in specialized domains like labor disputes. We propose a new approach leveraging the co-citation of legal articles within cases to establish similarity and enable algorithmic annotation. This method draws a parallel to the concept of case co-citation, utilizing cited precedents as indicators of shared legal issues. To evaluate the labeled results, we employ a system that recommends similar cases based on plaintiffs' accusations, defendants' rebuttals, and points of disputes. The evaluation demonstrates that the recommender, with finetuned text embedding models and a reasonable BiLSTM module can recommend labor cases whose similarity was measured by the co-citation of the legal articles. This research contributes to the development of automated annotation techniques for legal documents, particularly in areas with limited access to comprehensive legal databases.

Abstract: In recent years, the use of prompts to guide the output of Large Language Models have increased dramatically. However, even the best of experts struggle to choose the correct words to stitch up a prompt for the desired task. To solve this, LLM driven prompt optimization emerged as an important problem. Existing prompt optimization methods optimize a prompt globally, where in all the prompt tokens have to be optimized over a large vocabulary while solving a complex task. The large optimization space (tokens) leads to insufficient guidance for a better prompt. In this work, we introduce Local Prompt Optimization (LPO) that integrates with any general automatic prompt engineering method. We identify the optimization tokens in a prompt and nudge the LLM to focus only on those tokens in its optimization step. We observe remarkable performance improvements on Math Reasoning (GSM8k and MultiArith) and BIG-bench Hard benchmarks across various automatic prompt engineering methods. Further, we show that LPO converges to the optimal prompt faster than global methods.

Abstract: Diagnostic reasoning entails a physician's local (mental) model based on an assumed or known shared perspective (global model) to explain patient observations with evidence assigned towards a clinical assessment. But in several (complex) medical situations, multiple experts work together as a team to optimize health evaluation and decision-making by leveraging different perspectives. Such consensus-driven reasoning reflects individual knowledge contributing toward a broader perspective on the patient. In this light, we introduce STRUCture-following for Multiagent Systems (STRUC-MAS), a framework automating the learning of these global models and their incorporation as prior beliefs for agents in multiagent systems (MAS) to follow. We demonstrate proof of concept with a prosocial MAS application for predicting acute kidney injuries (AKIs). In this case, we found that incorporating a global structure enabled multiple agents to achieve better performance (average precision, AP) in predicting AKI 48 hours before onset (structure-following-fine-tuned, SF-FT, AP=0.195; SF-FT-retrieval-augmented generation, SF-FT-RAG, AP=0.194) vs. baseline (non-structure-following-FT, NSF-FT, AP=0.141; NSF-FT-RAG, AP=0.180) for balanced precision-weighted-recall-weighted voting. Markedly, SF-FT agents with higher recall scores reported lower confidence levels in the initial round on true positive and false negative cases. But after explicit interactions, their confidence in their decisions increased (suggesting reinforced belief). In contrast, the SF-FT agent with the lowest recall decreased its confidence in true positive and false negative cases (suggesting a new belief). This approach suggests that learning and leveraging global structures in MAS is necessary prior to achieving competitive classification and diagnostic reasoning performance.

Abstract: Optical computing systems provide an alternate hardware model which appears to be aligned with the demands of neural network workloads. However, the challenge of implementing energy efficient nonlinearities in optics -- a key requirement for realizing neural networks -- is a conspicuous missing link. In this work we introduce a novel method to achieve nonlinear computation in fully linear media. Our method can operate at low power and requires only the ability to drive the optical system at a data-dependent spatial position. Leveraging this positional encoding, we formulate a fully automated, topology-optimization-based hardware design framework for extremely specialized optical neural networks, drawing on modern advancements in optimization and machine learning. We evaluate our optical designs on machine learning classification tasks: demonstrating significant improvements over linear methods, and competitive performance when compared to standard artificial neural networks.

Abstract: While deep learning has shown strong performance in musculoskeletal imaging, existing work has largely focused on pathologies where diagnosis is not a clinical challenge, leaving more difficult problems underexplored, such as detecting Bankart lesions (anterior-inferior glenoid labral tears) on standard MRIs. Diagnosing these lesions is challenging due to their subtle imaging features, often leading to reliance on invasive MRI arthrograms (MRAs). This study introduces ScopeMRI, the first publicly available, expert-annotated dataset for shoulder pathologies, and presents a deep learning (DL) framework for detecting Bankart lesions on both standard MRIs and MRAs. ScopeMRI includes 586 shoulder MRIs (335 standard, 251 MRAs) from 558 patients who underwent arthroscopy. Ground truth labels were derived from intraoperative findings, the gold standard for diagnosis. Separate DL models for MRAs and standard MRIs were trained using a combination of CNNs and transformers. Predictions from sagittal, axial, and coronal views were ensembled to optimize performance. The models were evaluated on a 20% hold-out test set (117 MRIs: 46 MRAs, 71 standard MRIs). The models achieved an AUC of 0.91 and 0.93, sensitivity of 83% and 94%, and specificity of 91% and 86% for standard MRIs and MRAs, respectively. Notably, model performance on non-invasive standard MRIs matched or surpassed radiologists interpreting MRAs. External validation demonstrated initial generalizability across imaging protocols. This study demonstrates that DL models can achieve radiologist-level diagnostic performance on standard MRIs, reducing the need for invasive MRAs. By releasing ScopeMRI and a modular codebase for training and evaluating deep learning models on 3D medical imaging data, we aim to accelerate research in musculoskeletal imaging and support the development of new datasets for clinically challenging diagnostic tasks.

Abstract: Combining physics-based modeling with data-driven methods is critical to enabling the translation of computational methods to clinical use in cardiology. The use of rigorous differential equations combined with machine learning tools allows for model personalization with uncertainty quantification in time frames compatible with clinical practice. However, accurate and efficient surrogate models of cardiac function, built from physics-based numerical simulation, are still mostly geometry-specific and require retraining for different patients and pathological conditions. We propose a novel computational pipeline to embed cardiac anatomies into full-field surrogate models. We generate a dataset of electrophysiology simulations using a complex multi-scale mathematical model coupling partial and ordinary differential equations. We adopt Branched Latent Neural Maps (BLNMs) as an effective scientific machine learning method to encode activation maps extracted from physics-based numerical simulations into a neural network. Leveraging large deformation diffeomorphic metric mappings, we build a biventricular anatomical atlas and parametrize the anatomical variability of a small and challenging cohort of 13 pediatric patients affected by Tetralogy of Fallot. We propose a novel statistical shape modeling based z-score sampling approach to generate a new synthetic cohort of 52 biventricular geometries that are compatible with the original geometrical variability. This synthetic cohort acts as the training set for BLNMs. Our surrogate model demonstrates robustness and great generalization across the complex original patient cohort, achieving an average adimensional mean squared error of 0.0034. The Python implementation of our BLNM model is publicly available under MIT License at https://github.com/StanfordCBCL/BLNM.

Abstract: We present UniDetox, a universally applicable method designed to mitigate toxicity across various large language models (LLMs). Previous detoxification methods are typically model-specific, addressing only individual models or model families, and require careful hyperparameter tuning due to the trade-off between detoxification efficacy and language modeling performance. In contrast, UniDetox provides a detoxification technique that can be universally applied to a wide range of LLMs without the need for separate model-specific tuning. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient dataset distillation technique for detoxification using contrastive decoding. This approach distills detoxifying representations in the form of synthetic text data, enabling universal detoxification of any LLM through fine-tuning with the distilled text. Our experiments demonstrate that the detoxifying text distilled from GPT-2 can effectively detoxify larger models, including OPT, Falcon, and LLaMA-2. Furthermore, UniDetox eliminates the need for separate hyperparameter tuning for each model, as a single hyperparameter configuration can be seamlessly applied across different models. Additionally, analysis of the detoxifying text reveals a reduction in politically biased content, providing insights into the attributes necessary for effective detoxification of LLMs.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to address electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs) and shown superior imaging performances, which can be affected by the training dataset, the network architecture and the applied loss function. Here, the quality of data samples is cared and valued by the defined quality factor. Based on the quality factor, the composition of the training dataset is optimized. The network architecture is integrated with the residual connections and channel attention mechanism to improve feature extraction. A loss function that incorporates data-fitting error, physical-information constraints and the desired feature of the solution is designed and analyzed to suppress the background artifacts and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Various numerical analysis are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed quality-factor inspired deep neural network (QuaDNN) solver and the imaging performance is finally verified by experimental imaging test.

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning framework for generating point clouds from WiFi Channel State Information data. We employ a two-stage autoencoder approach: a PointNet autoencoder with convolutional layers for point cloud generation, and a Convolutional Neural Network autoencoder to map CSI data to a matching latent space. By aligning these latent spaces, our method enables accurate environmental point cloud reconstruction from WiFi data. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential for wireless sensing and environmental mapping applications.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are very useful methods to address semi-supervised learning (SSL) datasets, thanks to their ability to generate samples similar to real data. This approach, called SSL-GAN has attracted many researchers in the last decade. Evolutionary algorithms have been used to guide the evolution and training of SSL-GANs with great success. In particular, several co-evolutionary approaches have been applied where the two networks of a GAN (the generator and the discriminator) are evolved in separate populations. The co-evolutionary approaches published to date assume some spatial structure of the populations, based on the ideas of cellular evolutionary algorithms. They also create one single individual per generation and follow a generational replacement strategy in the evolution. In this paper, we re-consider those algorithmic design decisions and propose a new co-evolutionary approach, called Co-evolutionary Elitist SSL-GAN (CE-SSLGAN), with panmictic population, elitist replacement, and more than one individual in the offspring. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using three standard benchmark datasets. The results show that creating more than one offspring per population and using elitism improves the results in comparison with a classical SSL-GAN.

Abstract: We present ReasonIR-8B, the first retriever specifically trained for general reasoning tasks. Existing retrievers have shown limited gains on reasoning tasks, in part because existing training datasets focus on short factual queries tied to documents that straightforwardly answer them. We develop a synthetic data generation pipeline that, for each document, our pipeline creates a challenging and relevant query, along with a plausibly related but ultimately unhelpful hard negative. By training on a mixture of our synthetic data and existing public data, ReasonIR-8B achieves a new state-of-the-art of 29.9 nDCG@10 without reranker and 36.9 nDCG@10 with reranker on BRIGHT, a widely-used reasoning-intensive information retrieval (IR) benchmark. When applied to RAG tasks, ReasonIR-8B improves MMLU and GPQA performance by 6.4% and 22.6% respectively, relative to the closed-book baseline, outperforming other retrievers and search engines. In addition, ReasonIR-8B uses test-time compute more effectively: on BRIGHT, its performance consistently increases with longer and more information-rich rewritten queries; it continues to outperform other retrievers when combined with an LLM reranker. Our training recipe is general and can be easily extended to future LLMs; to this end, we open-source our code, data, and model.

Abstract: We study the consistency of minimum-norm interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces corresponding to bounded kernels. Our main result give lower bounds for the generalization error of the kernel interpolation measured in a continuous scale of norms that interpolate between $L^2$ and the hypothesis space. These lower bounds imply that kernel interpolation is always inconsistent, when the smoothness index of the norm is larger than a constant that depends only on the embedding index of the hypothesis space and the decay rate of the eigenvalues.

<title>Data Driven Deep Learning for Correcting Global Climate Model Projections of SST and DSL in the Bay of Bengal</title>

Abstract: Climate change alters ocean conditions, notably temperature and sea level. In the Bay of Bengal, these changes influence monsoon precipitation and marine productivity, critical to the Indian economy. In Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), Global Climate Models (GCMs) use different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to obtain future climate projections. However, significant discrepancies are observed between these models and the reanalysis data in the Bay of Bengal for 2015-2024. Specifically, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the climate model output and the Ocean Reanalysis System (ORAS5) is 1.2C for the sea surface temperature (SST) and 1.1 m for the dynamic sea level (DSL). We introduce a new data-driven deep learning model to correct for this bias. The deep neural model for each variable is trained using pairs of climatology-removed monthly climate projections as input and the corresponding month's ORAS5 as output. This model is trained with historical data (1950 to 2014), validated with future projection data from 2015 to 2020, and tested with future projections from 2021 to 2023. Compared to the conventional EquiDistant Cumulative Distribution Function (EDCDF) statistical method for bias correction in climate models, our approach decreases RMSE by 0.15C for SST and 0.3 m for DSL. The trained model subsequently corrects the projections for 2024-2100. A detailed analysis of the monthly, seasonal, and decadal means and variability is performed to underscore the implications of the novel dynamics uncovered in our corrected projections.

<title>On Stochastic Rounding with Few Random Bits</title>

Abstract: Large-scale numerical computations make increasing use of low-precision (LP) floating point formats and mixed precision arithmetic, which can be enhanced by the technique of stochastic rounding (SR), that is, rounding an intermediate high-precision value up or down randomly as a function of the value's distance to the two rounding candidates. Stochastic rounding requires, in addition to the high-precision input value, a source of random bits. As the provision of high-quality random bits is an additional computational cost, it is of interest to require as few bits as possible while maintaining the desirable properties of SR in a given computation, or computational domain. This paper examines a number of possible implementations of few-bit stochastic rounding (FBSR), and shows how several natural implementations can introduce sometimes significant bias into the rounding process, which are not present in the case of infinite-bit, infinite-precision examinations of these implementations. The paper explores the impact of these biases in machine learning examples, and hence opens another class of configuration parameters of which practitioners should be aware when developing or adopting low-precision floating point. Code is available at http://github.com/graphcore-research/arith25-stochastic-rounding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at countless tasks, yet struggle with creativity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that couples LLMs with structured representations and cognitively inspired manipulations to generate more creative and diverse ideas. Our notion of creativity goes beyond superficial token-level variations; rather, we explicitly recombine structured representations of existing ideas, allowing our algorithm to effectively explore the more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes. Experiments comparing our model's results to those of GPT-4o show greater diversity. Domain expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly coherent and feasible culinary creations, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms of novelty, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.

Abstract: In many, if not most, machine learning applications the training data is naturally heterogeneous (e.g. federated learning, adversarial attacks and domain adaptation in neural net training). Data heterogeneity is identified as one of the major challenges in modern day large-scale learning. A classical way to represent heterogeneous data is via a mixture model. In this paper, we study generalization performance and statistical rates when data is sampled from a mixture distribution. We first characterize the heterogeneity of the mixture in terms of the pairwise total variation distance of the sub-population distributions. Thereafter, as a central theme of this paper, we characterize the range where the mixture may be treated as a single (homogeneous) distribution for learning. In particular, we study the generalization performance under the classical PAC framework and the statistical error rates for parametric (linear regression, mixture of hyperplanes) as well as non-parametric (Lipschitz, convex and H\"older-smooth) regression problems. In order to do this, we obtain Rademacher complexity and (local) Gaussian complexity bounds with mixture data, and apply them to get the generalization and convergence rates respectively. We observe that as the (regression) function classes get more complex, the requirement on the pairwise total variation distance gets stringent, which matches our intuition. We also do a finer analysis for the case of mixed linear regression and provide a tight bound on the generalization error in terms of heterogeneity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage step-by-step reasoning to solve complex problems. Standard evaluation practice involves generating a complete reasoning trace and assessing the correctness of the final answer presented at its conclusion. In this paper, we challenge the reliance on the final answer by posing the following two questions: Does the final answer reliably represent the model's optimal conclusion? Can alternative reasoning paths yield different results? To answer these questions, we analyze intermediate reasoning steps, termed subthoughts, and propose a method based on our findings. Our approach involves segmenting a reasoning trace into sequential subthoughts based on linguistic cues. We start by prompting the model to generate continuations from the end-point of each intermediate subthought. We extract a potential answer from every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We find that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the mode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on the answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency among the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics that correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting potential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various LLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025) show consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\% and 10\% respectively. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/hammoudhasan/SubthoughtReasoner.

Abstract: Public vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), document vulnerabilities and facilitate threat information sharing. However, they often suffer from short descriptions and outdated or insufficient information. In this paper, we introduce Zad, a system designed to enrich NVD vulnerability descriptions by leveraging external resources. Zad consists of two pipelines: one collects and filters supplementary data using two encoders to build a detailed dataset, while the other fine-tunes a pre-trained model on this dataset to generate enriched descriptions. By addressing brevity and improving content quality, Zad produces more comprehensive and cohesive vulnerability descriptions. We evaluate Zad using standard summarization metrics and human assessments, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing vulnerability information.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown substantial promise in improving factual accuracy by grounding model responses with external knowledge relevant to queries. However, most existing RAG approaches are limited to a text-only corpus, and while recent efforts have extended RAG to other modalities such as images and videos, they typically operate over a single modality-specific corpus. In contrast, real-world queries vary widely in the type of knowledge they require, which a single type of knowledge source cannot address. To address this, we introduce UniversalRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to retrieve and integrate knowledge from heterogeneous sources with diverse modalities and granularities. Specifically, motivated by the observation that forcing all modalities into a unified representation space derived from a single combined corpus causes a modality gap, where the retrieval tends to favor items from the same modality as the query, we propose a modality-aware routing mechanism that dynamically identifies the most appropriate modality-specific corpus and performs targeted retrieval within it. Also, beyond modality, we organize each modality into multiple granularity levels, enabling fine-tuned retrieval tailored to the complexity and scope of the query. We validate UniversalRAG on 8 benchmarks spanning multiple modalities, showing its superiority over modality-specific and unified baselines.

Abstract: Since the early days of the Explainable AI movement, post-hoc explanations have been praised for their potential to improve user understanding, promote trust, and reduce patient safety risks in black box medical AI systems. Recently, however, critics have argued that the benefits of post-hoc explanations are greatly exaggerated since they merely approximate, rather than replicate, the actual reasoning processes that black box systems take to arrive at their outputs. In this article, we aim to defend the value of post-hoc explanations against this recent critique. We argue that even if post-hoc explanations do not replicate the exact reasoning processes of black box systems, they can still improve users' functional understanding of black box systems, increase the accuracy of clinician-AI teams, and assist clinicians in justifying their AI-informed decisions. While post-hoc explanations are not a "silver bullet" solution to the black box problem in medical AI, we conclude that they remain a useful strategy for addressing the black box problem in medical AI.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved great success in numerous NLP tasks but continue to exhibit notable gaps in multi-step factual reasoning, especially when real-world knowledge is sparse. Recent advances in grokking have demonstrated that neural networks can transition from memorizing to perfectly generalizing once they detect underlying logical patterns - yet these studies have primarily used small, synthetic tasks. In this paper, for the first time, we extend grokking to real-world factual data and address the challenge of dataset sparsity by augmenting existing knowledge graphs with carefully designed synthetic data to raise the ratio $\phi_r$ of inferred facts to atomic facts above the threshold required for grokking. Surprisingly, we find that even factually incorrect synthetic data can strengthen emergent reasoning circuits rather than degrade accuracy, as it forces the model to rely on relational structure rather than memorization. When evaluated on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, our approach achieves up to 95-100% accuracy on 2WikiMultiHopQA - substantially improving over strong baselines and matching or exceeding current state-of-the-art results. We further provide an in-depth analysis of how increasing $\phi_r$ drives the formation of generalizing circuits inside Transformers. Our findings suggest that grokking-based data augmentation can unlock implicit multi-hop reasoning capabilities, opening the door to more robust and interpretable factual reasoning in large-scale language models.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated great success in facilitating the reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we explore how these enhanced reasoning abilities can be exploited to improve the robustness of large language models in tasks that are not necessarily reasoning-focused. In particular, we show how a wide range of large language models exhibit significantly improved robustness against reference corruption using a simple method called chain-of-defensive-thought, where only a few exemplars with structured and defensive reasoning are provided as demonstrations. Empirically, the improvements can be astounding, especially given the simplicity and applicability of the method. For example, in the Natural Questions task, the accuracy of GPT-4o degrades from 60% to as low as 3% with standard prompting when 1 out of 10 references provided is corrupted with prompt injection attacks. In contrast, GPT-4o using chain-of-defensive-thought prompting maintains an accuracy of 50%.

Abstract: Probabilistic relational models such as parametric factor graphs enable efficient (lifted) inference by exploiting the indistinguishability of objects. In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.

Abstract: This paper introduces SoccerDiffusion, a transformer-based diffusion model designed to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer directly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots. Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference optimization methods. We release the dataset, pretrained models, and code under: https://bit-bots.github.io/SoccerDiffusion

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial and time-consuming task in clinical care, where mask precision is extremely important. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers a promising approach, as it provides an interactive interface based on visual prompting and edition to refine an initial segmentation. This model has strong generalization capabilities, does not rely on predefined classes, and adapts to diverse objects; however, it is pre-trained on natural images and lacks the ability to process medical data effectively. In addition, this model is built for 2D images, whereas a whole medical domain is based on 3D images, such as CT and MRI. Recent adaptations of SAM for medical imaging are based on 2D models, thus requiring one prompt per slice to segment 3D objects, making the segmentation process tedious. They also lack important features such as editing. To bridge this gap, we propose RadSAM, a novel method for segmenting 3D objects with a 2D model from a single prompt. In practice, we train a 2D model using noisy masks as initial prompts, in addition to bounding boxes and points. We then use this novel prompt type with an iterative inference pipeline to reconstruct the 3D mask slice-by-slice. We introduce a benchmark to evaluate the model's ability to segment 3D objects in CT images from a single prompt and evaluate the models' out-of-domain transfer and edition capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against state-of-the-art models on this benchmark using the AMOS abdominal organ segmentation dataset.

Abstract: As new products are emerging daily, recommendation systems are required to quickly adapt to possible new domains without needing extensive retraining. This work presents ``X-Cross'' -- a novel cross-domain sequential-recommendation model that recommends products in new domains by integrating several domain-specific language models; each model is fine-tuned with low-rank adapters (LoRA). Given a recommendation prompt, operating layer by layer, X-Cross dynamically refines the representation of each source language model by integrating knowledge from all other models. These refined representations are propagated from one layer to the next, leveraging the activations from each domain adapter to ensure domain-specific nuances are preserved while enabling adaptability across domains. Using Amazon datasets for sequential recommendation, X-Cross achieves performance comparable to a model that is fine-tuned with LoRA, while using only 25% of the additional parameters. In cross-domain tasks, such as adapting from Toys domain to Tools, Electronics or Sports, X-Cross demonstrates robust performance, while requiring about 50%-75% less fine-tuning data than LoRA to make fine-tuning effective. Furthermore, X-Cross achieves significant improvement in accuracy over alternative cross-domain baselines. Overall, X-Cross enables scalable and adaptive cross-domain recommendations, reducing computational overhead and providing an efficient solution for data-constrained environments.

<title>Preference-centric Bandits: Optimality of Mixtures and Regret-efficient Algorithms</title>

Abstract: The objective of canonical multi-armed bandits is to identify and repeatedly select an arm with the largest reward, often in the form of the expected value of the arm's probability distribution. Such a utilitarian perspective and focus on the probability models' first moments, however, is agnostic to the distributions' tail behavior and their implications for variability and risks in decision-making. This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting from expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed a preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different reward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that incorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward uncertainty. A fundamentally distinct observation in such a PM-centric perspective is that designing bandit algorithms will have a significantly different principle: as opposed to the reward-based models in which the optimal sampling policy converges to repeatedly sampling from the single best arm, in the PM-centric framework the optimal policy converges to selecting a mix of arms based on specific mixing weights. Designing such mixture policies departs from the principles for designing bandit algorithms in significant ways, primarily because of uncountable mixture possibilities. The paper formalizes the PM-centric framework and presents two algorithm classes (horizon-dependent and anytime) that learn and track mixtures in a regret-efficient fashion. These algorithms have two distinctions from their canonical counterparts: (i) they involve an estimation routine to form reliable estimates of optimal mixtures, and (ii) they are equipped with tracking mechanisms to navigate arm selection fractions to track the optimal mixtures. These algorithms' regret guarantees are investigated under various algebraic forms of the PMs.

Abstract: Measuring progress is fundamental to the advancement of any scientific field. As benchmarks play an increasingly central role, they also grow more susceptible to distortion. Chatbot Arena has emerged as the go-to leaderboard for ranking the most capable AI systems. Yet, in this work we identify systematic issues that have resulted in a distorted playing field. We find that undisclosed private testing practices benefit a handful of providers who are able to test multiple variants before public release and retract scores if desired. We establish that the ability of these providers to choose the best score leads to biased Arena scores due to selective disclosure of performance results. At an extreme, we identify 27 private LLM variants tested by Meta in the lead-up to the Llama-4 release. We also establish that proprietary closed models are sampled at higher rates (number of battles) and have fewer models removed from the arena than open-weight and open-source alternatives. Both these policies lead to large data access asymmetries over time. Providers like Google and OpenAI have received an estimated 19.2% and 20.4% of all data on the arena, respectively. In contrast, a combined 83 open-weight models have only received an estimated 29.7% of the total data. We show that access to Chatbot Arena data yields substantial benefits; even limited additional data can result in relative performance gains of up to 112% on the arena distribution, based on our conservative estimates. Together, these dynamics result in overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality. The Arena builds on the substantial efforts of both the organizers and an open community that maintains this valuable evaluation platform. We offer actionable recommendations to reform the Chatbot Arena's evaluation framework and promote fairer, more transparent benchmarking for the field

<title>Guessing Efficiently for Constrained Subspace Approximation</title>

Abstract: In this paper we study constrained subspace approximation problem. Given a set of $n$ points $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the goal of the {\em subspace approximation} problem is to find a $k$ dimensional subspace that best approximates the input points. More precisely, for a given $p\geq 1$, we aim to minimize the $p$th power of the $\ell_p$ norm of the error vector $(\|a_1-\bm{P}a_1\|,\ldots,\|a_n-\bm{P}a_n\|)$, where $\bm{P}$ denotes the projection matrix onto the subspace and the norms are Euclidean. In \emph{constrained} subspace approximation (CSA), we additionally have constraints on the projection matrix $\bm{P}$. In its most general form, we require $\bm{P}$ to belong to a given subset $\mathcal{S}$ that is described explicitly or implicitly.
  We introduce a general framework for constrained subspace approximation. Our approach, that we term coreset-guess-solve, yields either $(1+\varepsilon)$-multiplicative or $\varepsilon$-additive approximations for a variety of constraints. We show that it provides new algorithms for partition-constrained subspace approximation with applications to {\it fair} subspace approximation, $k$-means clustering, and projected non-negative matrix factorization, among others. Specifically, while we reconstruct the best known bounds for $k$-means clustering in Euclidean spaces, we improve the known results for the remainder of the problems.

Abstract: A person downloading a pre-trained model from the web should be aware of its biases. Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing labels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have access to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly limits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work, we present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that works without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual description of the classification task to identify biases in the target classification model. This description is fed to a large language model to generate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together with task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those captions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the given biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no constraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model on any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific annotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic unsupervised bias detection.

Abstract: Interpretable malware detection is crucial for understanding harmful behaviors and building trust in automated security systems. Traditional explainable methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often highlight important regions within a graph but fail to associate them with known benign or malicious behavioral patterns. This limitation reduces their utility in security contexts, where alignment with verified prototypes is essential. In this work, we introduce a novel dual prototype-driven explainable framework that interprets GNN-based malware detection decisions. This dual explainable framework integrates a base explainer (a state-of-the-art explainer) with a novel second-level explainer which is designed by subgraph matching technique, called SubMatch explainer. The proposed explainer assigns interpretable scores to nodes based on their association with matched subgraphs, offering a fine-grained distinction between benign and malicious regions. This prototype-guided scoring mechanism enables more interpretable, behavior-aligned explanations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves high detection performance while significantly improving interpretability in malware analysis.

Abstract: The continuous monitoring of the interactions between cyber-physical components of any industrial control system (ICS) is required to secure automation of the system controls, and to guarantee plant processes are fail-safe and remain in an acceptably safe state. Safety is achieved by managing actuation (where electric signals are used to trigger physical movement), dependent on corresponding sensor readings; used as ground truth in decision making. Timely detection of anomalies (attacks, faults and unascertained states) in ICSs is crucial for the safe running of a plant, the safety of its personnel, and for the safe provision of any services provided. We propose an anomaly detection method that involves accurate linearization of the non-linear forms arising from sensor-actuator(s) relationships, primarily because solving linear models is easier and well understood. Further, the time complexity of the anomaly detection scenario/problem at hand is lowered using dimensionality reduction of the actuator(s) in relationship with a sensor. We accomplish this by using a well-known water treatment testbed as a use case. Our experiments show millisecond time response to detect anomalies and provide explainability; that are not simultaneously achieved by other state of the art AI/ML models with eXplainable AI (XAI) used for the same purpose. Further, we pin-point the sensor(s) and its actuation state for which anomaly was detected.

Abstract: Early exits (EEs) offer a promising approach to reducing computational costs and latency by dynamically terminating inference once a satisfactory prediction confidence on a data sample is achieved. Although many works integrate EEs into encoder-only Transformers, their application to decoder-only architectures and, more importantly, Mamba models, a novel family of state-space architectures in the LLM realm, remains insufficiently explored. This work introduces DYNAMAX, the first framework to exploit the unique properties of Mamba architectures for early exit mechanisms. We not only integrate EEs into Mamba but also repurpose Mamba as an efficient EE classifier for both Mamba-based and transformer-based LLMs, showcasing its versatility. Our experiments employ the Mistral 7B transformer compared to the Codestral 7B Mamba model, using data sets such as TruthfulQA, CoQA, and TriviaQA to evaluate computational savings, accuracy, and consistency. The results highlight the adaptability of Mamba as a powerful EE classifier and its efficiency in balancing computational cost and performance quality across NLP tasks. By leveraging Mamba's inherent design for dynamic processing, we open pathways for scalable and efficient inference in embedded applications and resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the transformative potential of Mamba in redefining dynamic computing paradigms for LLMs.

Abstract: Developing scalable and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for cooperative multi-agent control has received significant attention over the past years. Existing literature has proposed inexact decompositions of local Q-functions based on empirical information structures between the agents. In this paper, we exploit inter-agent coupling information and propose a systematic approach to exactly decompose the local Q-function of each agent. We develop an approximate least square policy iteration algorithm based on the proposed decomposition and identify two architectures to learn the local Q-function for each agent. We establish that the worst-case sample complexity of the decomposition is equal to the centralized case and derive necessary and sufficient graphical conditions on the inter-agent couplings to achieve better sample efficiency. We demonstrate the improved sample efficiency and computational efficiency on numerical examples.

<title>Energy-Based Coarse-Graining in Molecular Dynamics: A Flow-Based Framework Without Data</title>

Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) models offer an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations, yet conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data-driven dependence limits their accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG model. We introduce a data-free generative framework for coarse-graining that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. Our model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, which are statistically associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, which represent the remaining degrees of freedom with simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A potentially learnable, bijective map from the full latent space to the all-atom configuration space enables automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective that minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, relying solely on the interatomic potential rather than sampled trajectories. A tempering scheme is used to stabilize training and promote exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate unbiased, one-shot equilibrium all-atom samples. We validate the method on two synthetic systems-a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture-as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide. The model captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, accurately reconstructs atomic configurations, and learns physically meaningful coarse-grained representations, all without any simulation data.
